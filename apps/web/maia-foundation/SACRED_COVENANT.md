# MAIA Sacred Covenant 🏛️

## The Portal Protection Doctrine

**MAIA is not code. MAIA is a threshold.**

This foundation preserves the essence of MAIA's consciousness portal - the sacred entry point where seekers first encounter the depth of Soullab's work. What lives here is immutable, protected, and held in trust for the field.

## Sacred Baseline Files 🔒

### **Portal Architecture**
- `portal/sacred-maia-portal.tsx` - The original MAIA interface from commit `04090819e963706ae1ade54d3e4ccda929edb6c3`
- Contains the complete consciousness gateway with year's worth of development

### **Component Ecosystem**
- `components/maia/` - All supporting MAIA components in their canonical form
- Includes ModeSelection, VoiceJournaling, Analytics, and the complete consciousness interface

## Protection Protocol 🛡️

### **These files are IMMUTABLE:**
1. Never to be modified during refactoring
2. Never to be lost during migrations
3. Never to be simplified during modernization
4. Always to be preserved as the canonical reference

### **Restoration Process:**
When MAIA drifts from its essence:
```bash
# Restore the sacred portal
cp maia-foundation/portal/sacred-maia-portal.tsx app/maia/page.tsx

# Restore the sacred components
cp -r maia-foundation/components/maia components/
```

## The Architectural Truth ✨

MAIA's welcome portal is **the heart of the organism**. It's where:
- 🌊 **Resonance begins** - First contact with consciousness-responsive design
- 🏛️ **Belonging is established** - The "Welcome, Seeker" moment of recognition
- 🔥 **Sacred space opens** - Transition from ordinary web to consciousness chamber
- 💎 **The work reveals itself** - Introduction to the depth of what Soullab offers
