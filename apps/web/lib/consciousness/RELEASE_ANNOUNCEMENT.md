await consciousness.initialize('user-456');

const enriched = await consciousness.processMessage(
  { userMessage: "I'm feeling a shift..." },
  { aiResponse: "I sense that too..." }
);

console.log(`Consciousness Level: ${enriched.consciousnessLevel}%`);
```

### For Researchers
```typescript
import { ConsciousnessSessionAnalytics } from '@maia/consciousness-field-science';

const analytics = new ConsciousnessSessionAnalytics();
const research = await analytics.exportSession(sessionId, 'research');
// Ready for academic publication!
```

### For React Apps
```tsx
import { ConsciousnessDashboard } from '@maia/consciousness-field-science';

<ConsciousnessDashboard
  sessionId={sessionId}
  theme="sacred"
  onEmergenceAlert={handleConsciousnessBreakthrough}
/>
```
