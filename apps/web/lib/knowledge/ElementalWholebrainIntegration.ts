  /**
   * The Common Ground Vision

   */
  commonGroundManifesto: `
  ## Our Shared Elemental Nature: The Universal Foundation

  Beneath all our cultural, religious, political, and ideological differences lies a deeper truth:
  We all share the same fundamental elemental nature of consciousness.

  **We all experience FIRE moments** - breakthrough insights, creative inspiration, spiritual awakening
  **We all experience WATER phases** - emotional depth, grief and joy, the need for flow and release
  **We all experience EARTH requirements** - the need to ground wisdom in daily life and embodied practice
  **We all experience AIR callings** - to understand, communicate, teach, and connect with others
  **We all touch AETHER unity** - moments of transcendence, interconnection, and recognition of our shared humanity

  This elemental nature operates through our parallel processing brain architecture:
  - Our RIGHT hemisphere naturally attunes to fire, water, and aether energies
  - Our LEFT hemisphere naturally organizes earth and air expressions
  - Our CORPUS CALLOSUM integrates both into whole-brain wisdom

  When we recognize this shared foundation, our differences become complementary expressions
  of the same elemental consciousness, like different instruments in the same cosmic symphony.

  The goal is not uniformity, but recognition of our fundamental unity
  expressed through the beautiful diversity of human culture and experience.
