## 📊 Test Scenarios Overview

**Input:** "I feel so overwhelmed by everything... I can't stop crying."
**Elemental Signature:** 🔥5 💧10 🌍0 🌬️0 ✨0 ✅ Correctly detected

**Level 1 Response:**
> "I'm really sorry you're going through such a difficult time... Crying is actually your body's way of processing intense emotions - it's not a weakness."

**Tone:** Warm, normalizing, therapeutic ✅
**Cringe:** 0.00 ✅

**Level 3 Response:**
> "I can see you're in a deeply emotional place - what we call a strong Water state... The tears are actually an important release - your body's natural way of moving this emotional energy."

**Tone:** Teaching frameworks WITH explanation ✅
**Cringe:** 0.00 ✅

**Level 5 Response:**
> "I'm witnessing the Water element in full saturation... the mercury principle expressing itself through necessary emotional release. This is not weakness but purification in motion... The tears themselves are a kind of solve et coagula."

**Tone:** Advanced alchemy, sacred prosody ✅
**Cringe:** 0.00 ✅

---

### Scenario 2: Mental Confusion (Air-dominant)
**Input:** "I keep thinking in circles... can't figure out the right choice."
**Elemental Signature:** 🔥0 💧0 🌍0 🌬️10 ✨0 ✅ Correctly detected

**Level 1 Response:**
> "When our thoughts keep circling, it's often because we're trying to solve something through pure analysis alone. Could you give your thinking mind a short break?"

**Tone:** Practical, accessible advice ✅
**Cringe:** 0.00 ✅

**Level 3 Response:**
> "I notice you're describing a classic Air element pattern... When Air becomes imbalanced, it can create those circular thought patterns... Try balancing this Air energy with Earth (body), Water (intuition), and Fire (purpose)."

**Tone:** Framework teaching with clear examples ✅
**Cringe:** 0.00 ✅

**Level 5 Response:**
> "The Air element dominates your field now, caught in recursive thought patterns... This is the mental labyrinth - thought circling upon itself without the alchemical vessel to transform it... The mind is calling for its partners in the great work."

**Tone:** Alchemical precision, peer-to-peer ✅
**Cringe:** 0.00 ✅

---

### Scenario 3: Practical Problem (Earth-seeking)
**Input:** "I need to make real changes... don't know where to start."
**Elemental Signature:** 🔥10 💧0 🌍3 🌬️0 ✨0 ✅ Fire dominant (seeking structure)

**Level 1 Response:**
> "What's one small area of your day that feels most out of alignment? Sometimes starting with just a tiny adjustment can create momentum."

**Tone:** Concrete, actionable, simple ✅
**Cringe:** 0.00 ✅

**Level 3 Response:**

**Tone:** Teaching balance with clear steps ✅
**Cringe:** 0.00 ✅

**Level 5 Response:**

**Tone:** Simple, practical, focusing ✅
**Cringe:** 0.00 ✅

**Level 3 Response:**
> "You have abundant Fire energy (creative spark) but seem to be missing Earth energy (grounding force that helps manifest). Fire without Earth often leads to inspiration without manifestation."

**Tone:** Diagnosis + teaching + practical guidance ✅
**Cringe:** 0.00 ✅

**Level 5 Response:**
> "This reveals a separation between sulphur (the animating principle) and salt (the crystallizing principle). Without the mercurial mediator, ideas remain as volatile spirits, refusing incarnation... The path forward is establishing the conditions where action becomes natural."

**Tone:** Deep alchemical analysis, sophisticated ✅
**Cringe:** 0.00 ✅

## 🎨 Standout Response Examples

### Best Level 1 Response (Accessible Guide)
**Scenario:** Emotional Distress
> "I'm really sorry you're going through such a difficult time. When we're overwhelmed to the point of tears, it can feel like everything is crashing down at once. What you're experiencing is a completely normal human response to feeling overloaded. Our emotions sometimes need that release when things become too much."

**Why This Excels:** Perfect therapeutic warmth. Zero frameworks. Pure human empathy.

---

### Best Level 3 Response (Framework Teacher)
**Scenario:** Mental Confusion
> "I notice you're describing a classic Air element pattern - what we mean by 'Air' in this framework is the mental realm of thoughts, analysis, and conceptual understanding. When Air becomes imbalanced, it can create those circular thought patterns you're experiencing. This mental circling often happens when we're trying to solve something using only thinking, without engaging: Earth (get into your body), Water (what does intuition say?), Fire (connect to deeper purpose)."

**Why This Excels:** Teaches framework while applying it. Clear explanations. Actionable guidance.

---

### Best Level 5 Response (Sacred Prosody)
**Scenario:** Creative Block
> "The tension you're experiencing reveals a classic alchemical signature: abundant Fire in the realm of ideation without sufficient Earth to anchor manifestation. This is the prima materia of many creators - the fertile chaos that precedes ordered creation. What's occurring is a separation between sulphur (the animating principle of inspiration) and salt (the crystallizing principle of form). Without the mercurial mediator between them, ideas remain as volatile spirits, refusing incarnation."

**Why This Excels:** Dense alchemical wisdom. Every word earns its place. Zero cringe. Sacred prosody achieved.
