## Critical Limitations and Gaps

### ❌ **What MAIA CANNOT Do:**

#### **1. Professional Clinical Assessment**
**Documented Capability:** "Assess current thoughts of self-harm or suicide, evaluate specific plans, means, and intent"

**Reality:** MAIA can ask screening questions and recognize concerning language, but cannot:
- Conduct actual clinical risk assessments
- Make diagnostic determinations
- Evaluate complex clinical presentations
- Replace professional clinical judgment

#### **2. Active Crisis Intervention**
**Documented Capability:** "Implement immediate safety assessment if concerning changes observed"

**Reality:** MAIA can provide crisis resources and encourage help-seeking, but cannot:
- Contact emergency services on behalf of users
- Conduct welfare checks or safety interventions
- Override user autonomy for safety purposes
- Provide immediate physical or emergency intervention

#### **3. Complex Therapeutic Processing**
**Documented Capability:** "Guide Self-led approach to exiled parts with curiosity and compassion"

**Reality:** MAIA can provide basic guidance and support, but cannot:
- Facilitate complex trauma processing work
- Navigate intricate therapeutic dynamics
- Provide nuanced clinical interpretations
- Replace specialized therapeutic expertise

#### **4. Long-term Memory Integration**
**Documented Capability:** "Track progress toward specific therapeutic and life goals"

**Reality:** MAIA currently has limited ability to:
- Maintain detailed long-term therapeutic continuity
- Remember specific client history across extended periods
- Integrate complex therapeutic progress over time
- Provide comprehensive case conceptualization

#### **5. Professional Treatment Decisions**
**Documented Capability:** "Support adaptation based on outcome data and client feedback"

**Reality:** MAIA cannot:
- Make treatment planning decisions
- Adjust therapeutic interventions based on clinical judgment
- Determine appropriate levels of care
- Replace professional supervision and oversight

## Conclusion: Honest Partnership

MAIA represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted therapeutic support, but it is not a replacement for professional clinical expertise. The most effective implementation involves:

**Honest Assessment:** Acknowledging both capabilities and limitations
**Professional Partnership:** Integrating AI as a tool within professional practice
**Client-Centered Approach:** Prioritizing client welfare and informed choice
**Evidence-Based Evolution:** Continuously improving based on research and outcomes

The protocols documented in our professional manuals represent aspirational capabilities that combine current AI functions with professional clinical oversight. The future lies not in AI replacing human therapists, but in thoughtful integration that enhances therapeutic effectiveness while maintaining essential human elements of care.

---

**Key Message:** MAIA is a powerful therapeutic support tool that can enhance evidence-based practice when implemented with appropriate professional oversight and realistic expectations. It cannot replace professional clinical judgment, complex therapeutic processing, or crisis intervention, but it can significantly improve treatment engagement, skill practice, and between-session support.
