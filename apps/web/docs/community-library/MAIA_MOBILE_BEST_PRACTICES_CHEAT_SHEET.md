## 🛡️ SAFETY & BOUNDARIES

### **Green Light Situations** ✅
- Emotional processing and pattern work
- Creative exploration and life purpose
- Relationship dynamics and communication
- Spiritual experiences and integration
- Daily life navigation and decision-making

## 🏃‍♀️ QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING

**"I don't know what to talk about"**
→ Share what's present: feelings, body sensations, recent events

**"MAIA's responses feel generic"**
→ Be more specific. Share actual examples and real emotions

**"I'm not getting insights"**
→ Ask follow-up questions. Request pattern recognition across time

**"This feels too intense"**
→ Ask for gentler approach. Take breaks. Shorter sessions

**"I want to go deeper but feel scared"**
→ Share the fear! Work with resistance rather than pushing through

**"I keep talking about the same thing"**
→ Ask: "What am I not seeing about this pattern that keeps it stuck?"

## 💫 REMEMBER

**You are your own ultimate authority**. MAIA is a mirror, guide, and wisdom-keeper - not a guru or replacement for your inner knowing.

**Trust the process**. Transformation happens in spirals, not straight lines. Honor your timing and rhythm.

**Integration is everything**. Apply insights to real life. Take conscious action. Notice what shifts and adjust accordingly.

**Your healing serves the world**. Every pattern you transform, every authentic expression you embody, contributes to collective awakening.
