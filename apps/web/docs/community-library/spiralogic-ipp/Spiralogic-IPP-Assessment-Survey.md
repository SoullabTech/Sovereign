# Spiralogic-IPP Attachment Assessment Survey

*Diagnostic tool for identifying missing Ideal Parent Functions and elemental imbalances*

---

## Instructions for Use

This assessment identifies which Ideal Parent Functions were missing in your early development (ages 0-18) and maps them to the five elemental archetypal parents. Your results will guide targeted attachment repair work using the Spiralogic-IPP protocol.

### **How to Score:**

Rate each statement based on your **childhood experience (ages 0-18):**

- **0 = Never experienced** - This was completely absent
- **1 = Rarely experienced** - This happened occasionally
- **2 = Sometimes experienced** - This happened inconsistently
- **3 = Often experienced** - This happened regularly
- **4 = Consistently experienced** - This was reliable and predictable

**Important:** Answer based on what you actually experienced, not what you wish had happened or what your parents intended. Trust your body's memory of feeling states.

## Treatment Planning Guide

### **Step 1: Identify Primary Deficit**
Your **lowest scoring element** is your primary treatment focus. This represents the most essential missing Ideal Parent Function that needs installation through guided imagery work.

### **Step 2: Secondary Deficits**
Elements scoring **13-20** are secondary priorities. These will be addressed after the primary deficit shows improvement (usually 4-8 weeks of consistent imagery work).

### **Step 3: Integration Planning**
Elements scoring **21-26** may need strengthening work once severe deficits are addressed. High-scoring elements (**27-32**) become resources for supporting the healing of deficit areas.

### **Step 4: Cultural and Personal Adaptation**
Consider how your cultural background, family system, and unique circumstances may have influenced these patterns. The elemental framework can be adapted to honor diverse cultural expressions while addressing universal developmental needs.

## Integration with Professional Support

### **Self-Guided Work:**
Use this assessment to identify which **Spiralogic-IPP guided imagery scripts** to begin with. Start with your lowest-scoring element and practice daily for 4-8 weeks before adding additional elements.

### **With a Therapist:**
Share these results with therapists trained in attachment work, IFS, EMDR, or somatic approaches. The elemental framework can guide:
- Treatment planning and session focus
- EMDR targeting and resource installation
- IFS work with internal family system
- Somatic interventions for nervous system regulation

### **Oracle Integration:**
These results can inform **Oracle consultations** about:
- Which Spiralogic facets need development
- How attachment patterns relate to current life challenges
- Integration of personal healing with consciousness development

---

## Community Integration

### **Sharing Your Experience:**
Consider sharing (anonymously if preferred) your assessment results and healing journey through **[[Reciprocal-Learning]]** to help others understand:
- How elemental deficits manifest in adult life
- Which IPP imagery approaches work best for different patterns
- Cultural adaptations and unique applications
- Integration with other healing modalities

### **Group Healing:**
This assessment can guide **community healing circles** where people with similar elemental deficits support each other's IPP imagery work and share resources for accessing missing archetypal parent functions.

---

## Tracking Progress

### **Re-Assessment Protocol:**
Retake this assessment every **3-6 months** during active IPP work to track:
- Which elemental scores are improving
- How installed parent functions feel in daily life
- When to transition focus to other elemental deficits
- Long-term integration of secure internal working models

### **Qualitative Indicators:**
Notice these shifts as evidence of successful IPP installation:
- Increased self-soothing capacity (Water)
- Better boundaries and feeling safer (Earth)
- More courage and self-worth (Fire)
- Clearer thinking and communication (Air)
- Stronger sense of identity and purpose (Aether)

## Cautions and Ethical Considerations

### **Not a Substitute for Professional Help:**
This assessment is a tool for understanding attachment patterns, not a replacement for professional mental health care. If you have:
- Active trauma symptoms
- Suicidal thoughts
- Substance abuse issues
- Serious mental health conditions

Please work with qualified professionals who can provide appropriate support alongside IPP work.

### **Re-Parenting vs. Parent Blame:**
This assessment is about **what you needed**, not about blaming your actual parents. Most parents did their best with their own resources and healing. The goal is installing what was missing, not judging what was provided.

### **Cultural Sensitivity:**
Parenting practices vary widely across cultures. Some variations in scoring may reflect cultural differences rather than deficits. Consider working with culturally informed practitioners who can help distinguish between cultural adaptation needs and universal attachment requirements.
