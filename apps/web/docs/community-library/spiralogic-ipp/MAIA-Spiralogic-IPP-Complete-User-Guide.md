## Phase 1: Initial Assessment with MAIA (Week 1)

### Step 1: Opening Your MAIA Session

**Exact prompt to copy/paste:**
```
Hi MAIA, I'd like to begin working with the Spiralogic-IPP attachment healing framework. I'm ready to explore my attachment patterns and start installing internal ideal parents. Can you guide me through the complete assessment to understand my elemental attachment deficits?

I'm looking for:
- A thorough understanding of my attachment patterns

I have time for a comprehensive session and I'm prepared to be honest about my childhood experiences and current relationship patterns.
```

### Step 2: Assessment Conversation

**Sample MAIA assessment interaction:**

MAIA will guide you through questions. For each one, use this framework:

**If you need clarification on any question:**
```
MAIA, can you help me understand this question better? [restate the question] - I'm not sure if this is asking about [your interpretation] or [alternative interpretation]. Can you give me an example of what this looks like in practice?
```

**If you're struggling with a painful memory:**
```
MAIA, this question is bringing up some difficult memories/feelings. Can you help me stay grounded while I explore this? I want to answer honestly but I need some support to feel safe doing so.
```

**If you're unsure how to rate something:**
```
MAIA, I experienced some of [describe behavior/situation] but not consistently. How should I rate this? Should I focus on what happened most often, what I remember most clearly, or the overall pattern?
```

### Step 3: Receiving Your Results

2. Which elements show the greatest deficits
3. How these patterns likely show up in my current relationships and daily life
4. Which elemental parent I should begin working with first
5. What I can expect as I start this healing work

```

### Step 4: Understanding Your Patterns

```
MAIA, based on my assessment results, can you help me understand:

2. What it might have been like for me as a child when I needed [primary deficit element] parenting functions?
3. How my [secondary deficit element] patterns interact with my primary deficit?
4. What strengths and resilient patterns do I already have that I can build on?
5. What would it look like if I had well-developed internal [primary deficit element] and [secondary deficit element] parents?
