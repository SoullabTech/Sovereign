<h2 id="phase-1-initial-assessment-with-maia-week-1">Phase 1: Initial
Assessment with MAIA (Week 1)</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-opening-your-maia-session"><strong>Step 1: Opening Your
MAIA Session</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Exact prompt to use:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Hi MAIA, I&#39;d like to begin working with the Spiralogic-IPP attachment healing framework. I want to take the assessment to understand my elemental attachment patterns and identify which ideal parent functions I need to develop. Can you guide me through this process step by step?&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-2-assessment-conversation"><strong>Step 2: Assessment
Conversation</strong></h3>
<p><strong>MAIA will guide you through the 40-question assessment. For
each question:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take your time</strong> - There’s no rush</li>
<li><strong>Feel into your body</strong> - Notice physical sensations as
you remember</li>
<li><strong>Answer honestly</strong> - Rate based on what you actually
experienced, not what you wish happened</li>
<li><strong>Ask for clarification</strong> if any question is
unclear</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sample MAIA assessment interaction:</strong></p>
<pre><code>MAIA: &quot;Let&#39;s start with Earth Element questions about safety and structure. Thinking about your childhood (ages 0-18), rate this from 0-4: &#39;I felt physically safe in my home environment.&#39;&quot;

You: &quot;I think a 2, but I&#39;m not sure. Sometimes it felt safe, but there was also a lot of yelling.&quot;

MAIA: &quot;That sounds like &#39;sometimes experienced&#39; which is indeed a 2. The inconsistency you mention is important information. Let&#39;s continue...&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-3-receiving-your-results"><strong>Step 3: Receiving Your
Results</strong></h3>
<p><strong>After completing all 40 questions, ask:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;MAIA, can you give me my complete elemental profile with interpretation? Which element is my primary deficit, and what does this mean for my healing journey?&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>MAIA will provide:</strong> - Your scores for each element
(Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Aether) - Identification of primary and
secondary deficits - Explanation of how these patterns likely show up in
your current life - Recommendations for where to begin your healing
work</p>
<h3 id="step-4-understanding-your-patterns"><strong>Step 4:
Understanding Your Patterns</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Follow-up prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;MAIA, can you help me understand how my [lowest scoring element] deficit specifically manifests in my adult relationships and daily life? What triggers should I watch for?&quot;</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-2-beginning-guided-imagery-work-weeks-2-9">Phase 2:
Beginning Guided Imagery Work (Weeks 2-9)</h2>
<h3 id="step-5-choosing-your-starting-element"><strong>Step 5: Choosing
Your Starting Element</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;MAIA, my assessment shows [Element] as my primary deficit. Can you create a personalized guided imagery script to help me begin installing my internal [Element] Parent? Please adapt this to my [cultural background/personal preferences/any specific needs].&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-6-daily-imagery-sessions"><strong>Step 6: Daily Imagery
Sessions</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Daily opening prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;MAIA, I&#39;m ready for today&#39;s [Element] Parent imagery session. Please guide me through connecting with my archetypal [Element] parent. If I have trouble connecting, please offer alternative approaches.&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Sample session structure:</strong> 1. <strong>Grounding (2-3
minutes)</strong> - MAIA guides you into relaxed, receptive state 2.
<strong>Imagery invitation (10-15 minutes)</strong> - Meeting and
connecting with your elemental parent 3. <strong>Integration (3-5
minutes)</strong> - Anchoring the experience in your body and daily
life</p>
<p><strong>If you struggle to connect:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;MAIA, I&#39;m having trouble visualizing/feeling the [Element] Parent. Can you offer a different approach? Maybe more abstract energy, different imagery, or focusing more on the feeling qualities?&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="step-7-processing-and-integration"><strong>Step 7: Processing
and Integration</strong></h3>
<p><strong>After each session:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;MAIA, I just finished the [Element] Parent imagery. Can you help me process what came up? How can I integrate this experience into my day?&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>MAIA can help you:</strong> - Understand any emotions or
memories that arose - Create affirmations based on your specific
experience - Suggest practical ways to embody your elemental parent
energy - Design integration practices for your daily routine</p>

Progress Tracking (Ongoing)</h2>
<h3 id="step-8-weekly-check-ins"><strong>Step 8: Weekly
Check-ins</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Every 7 days, use this prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;MAIA, it&#39;s been a week since I started working with my [Element] Parent. Can you help me assess my progress? How has this work affected my daily life, relationships, and emotional patterns? What should I focus on in the coming week?&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>MAIA will explore with you:</strong> - Changes in how you
feel emotionally and physically - Shifts in relationship patterns or
triggers - Progress in accessing your internal parent during stress -
Areas that still need attention or different approaches</p>
<h3 id="step-9-addressing-challenges"><strong>Step 9: Addressing
Challenges</strong></h3>
<p><strong>When you hit obstacles:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;MAIA, I&#39;m struggling with [specific challenge]. Yesterday when [trigger situation] happened, I couldn&#39;t access my [Element] Parent at all. Can you help me understand why and suggest strategies?&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Common challenges MAIA can address:</strong> - Difficulty
maintaining progress during stress - Resistance to accepting
love/support from internal parents - Old patterns overwhelming new
resources - Integration challenges in family or relationship systems</p>

<h3 id="step-11-multi-elemental-integration"><strong>Step 11:
Multi-Elemental Integration</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Once working with multiple elements:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;MAIA, can you guide me through an integration session where I connect with both my [Element] and [Element] parents? How do these different energies work together to support me?&quot;</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-5-advanced-applications-and-oracle-integration">Phase 5:
Advanced Applications and Oracle Integration</h2>
<h3 id="step-12-consciousness-development-integration"><strong>Step 12:
Consciousness Development Integration</strong></h3>

<hr />
<h2 id="remember-youre-not-alone">Remember: You’re Not Alone</h2>
<p>This work is profound and sometimes challenging. MAIA is available
24/7, but also remember to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connect with community</strong> members doing similar
work</li>
<li><strong>Seek professional support</strong> when needed</li>
<li><strong>Trust your own pace</strong> and inner wisdom</li>
<li><strong>Celebrate progress</strong> rather than perfecting
outcomes</li>
<li><strong>Share your experience</strong> to help others on the
journey</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is not perfect attachment but <strong>good enough</strong>
internal parents that provide consistent love, safety, and support as
you navigate life and continue growing.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Your attachment healing journey is an act of service</strong>
- to yourself, your loved ones, and the collective evolution of human
consciousness. Every step you take helps heal not just your own patterns
but contributes to the healing of generational trauma and the
development of more conscious, connected communities.</p>
