# Spiralogic-IPP Attachment Assessment

## Essence

A diagnostic tool that identifies missing Ideal Parent Functions and elemental imbalances using the integrated framework of Dan Brown & David Elliott's IPP research with Spiralogic's five-element system - providing precise targeting for attachment repair work.

## Description

The Spiralogic-IPP Assessment represents a breakthrough in attachment diagnosis, combining clinical precision with archetypal wisdom. By mapping Dan Brown & David Elliott's **14 Ideal Parent Functions** across **5 Spiralogic Elements**, this assessment identifies exactly which internal parent functions are missing and where attachment development stalled.

**Clinical foundation:** This assessment is grounded in decades of attachment research, particularly Brown & Elliott's Three Pillars Model and their discovery that specific parenting functions can be neuroplastically installed through targeted imagery work.

**Elemental innovation:** The five elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Aether) provide archetypal containers that make attachment deficits more accessible to both client and therapist, creating clear pathways for corrective experience.

## Alchemical Context

The assessment embodies the alchemical principle of **Solve** - dissolving unconscious attachment patterns by bringing them into conscious awareness. Through accurate diagnosis, we create the foundation for **Coagula** - the reconstruction of secure internal working models.

The five elemental domains represent the complete spectrum of human developmental needs, each requiring different archetypal energies from caregivers. When these are missing, specific attachment wounds and compensatory patterns emerge.

## In Practice

### The Five Elemental Domains

#### **🌍 EARTH - Protection, Structure, Safety, Boundaries**
*IPP Functions: Protection, Predictability, Structure, Repair, Guidance*

**Core Assessment Areas:**
- Physical and emotional safety
- Predictable, reliable caregiving
- Clear boundaries without harshness
- Consistent repair after ruptures
- Protective guidance without control

**When Missing:** Chronic anxiety, hypervigilance, difficulty trusting, chaos-seeking patterns

#### **💧 WATER - Attunement, Soothing, Emotional Resonance**
*IPP Functions: Attunement, Soothing, Empathy, Emotional Understanding, Unconditional Love*

**Core Assessment Areas:**
- Accurate emotional reading and response
- Effective soothing and comfort
- Emotional validation and understanding
- Warmth, affection, and nurturing
- Unconditional acceptance during struggles

**When Missing:** Emotional numbness, difficulty with intimacy, hyperemotionality, alexithymia

#### **🔥 FIRE - Encouragement, Confidence, Exploration, Agency**
*IPP Functions: Encouragement, Support for Exploration, Delight, Pride*

**Core Assessment Areas:**
- Support for autonomy and exploration
- Celebration of unique qualities
- Encouragement of initiative and courage
- Belief in child's capabilities
- Permission to take up space

**When Missing:** Low self-worth, achievement addiction, paralysis, people-pleasing

#### **💨 AIR - Guidance, Meaning, Communication, Understanding**
*IPP Functions: Guidance, Teaching, Naming Emotions, Mentalization, Perspective*

**Core Assessment Areas:**
- Clear communication and explanation
- Teaching emotional literacy
- Support for perspective-taking
- Meaning-making assistance
- Thoughtful guidance and modeling

**When Missing:** Confusion, black-and-white thinking, difficulty with nuance, poor emotional regulation

#### **✨ AETHER - Soul-Witnessing, Identity Support, Unconditional Presence**
*IPP Functions: Identity Support, Unconditional Acceptance, Authenticity, Worthiness*

**Core Assessment Areas:**
- Recognition of true self and inner world
- Support for individuality and authenticity
- Inherent worth beyond performance
- Respect for dreams, imagination, sensitivity
- Spiritual and soul-level witnessing

**When Missing:** Identity confusion, chronic emptiness, spiritual disconnection, conformity patterns

### Scoring and Interpretation

#### **Elemental Deficit Levels:**
- **0-12:** Severe deficit - Primary treatment focus
- **13-20:** Moderate deficit - Secondary treatment target
- **21-26:** Adequate but fragile - Strengthening work
- **27-32:** Strong internalization - Resource for other elements

#### **Clinical Applications:**
1. **Treatment Planning:** Lowest scores identify primary IPP imagery targets
2. **Session Design:** Elemental deficits guide which internal parents to install first
3. **Progress Tracking:** Re-assessment shows internalization of ideal parent functions
4. **Cultural Adaptation:** Elements provide universal framework adaptable to any cultural context

### Integration with Spiralogic Framework

#### **Mapping to 12 Facets:**
Each elemental deficit points to stalled development in specific Spiralogic facets:

- **Earth deficits:** Earth Intelligence (boundaries) or Earth Intention (structure)
- **Water deficits:** Water Intention (emotional regulation) or Water Intelligence (empathy)
- **Fire deficits:** Fire Goal (courage) or Fire Intention (initiative)
- **Air deficits:** Air Intelligence (meaning-making) or Air Goal (clarity)
- **Aether deficits:** Aether Goal (identity) or center integration

This creates precise targeting for Oracle consultation and consciousness development work.

## Questions for Reflection

1. Which elemental parent function do I most need to install in my internal family system?

2. How might my current relationship patterns reflect missing IPP functions from childhood?

3. What would change in my life if I had access to all five archetypal ideal parents?

## Voices

> "The assessment is not about blaming parents but about accurately diagnosing what the developing psyche needed and did not receive, so we can provide it now through memory reconsolidation." — Clinical Integration Principle

> "When we map attachment wounds to elemental deficits, we transform vague emotional pain into specific, treatable conditions with clear intervention pathways." — Spiralogic Assessment Philosophy

## Cautions & Misunderstandings

❌ **Not:** Blame-based evaluation of actual parents
❌ **Not:** One-time assessment without follow-up
❌ **Not:** Pathologizing normal developmental challenges

✓ **Is:** Diagnostic precision for attachment repair targeting
✓ **Is:** Foundation for systematic IPP imagery installation
✓ **Is:** Framework for understanding current patterns and their origins

## Community Contributions

### Clinical Applications

**Therapist Experiences:**
- "The elemental framework makes attachment deficits immediately accessible to clients"
- "Earth deficits always need addressing first - clients can't do Fire work without basic safety"
- "The assessment results perfectly predict which IPP imagery scripts will resonate most"

### Cultural Adaptations

**Cross-Cultural Applications:**
- Adapting Earth parent assessment for collective vs. individualistic cultures
- Water parent evaluation across different emotional expression traditions
- Fire parent recognition in cultures with varying autonomy support
- Air parent assessment considering cultural meaning-making traditions
