# Project Invariants (MUST FOLLOW)

## Database & Backend

- **We do NOT use Supabase.** Never introduce Supabase. Use local PostgreSQL via `lib/db/postgres.ts` only.
- **If you see Supabase in code, remove it; do not consolidate it.**
- Database: Local PostgreSQL at `postgresql://soullab@localhost:5432/maia_consciousness`
- Database client: `lib/db/postgres.ts` (uses `pg` npm package)
- Never add `@supabase/*` imports, RLS policies, or Supabase migrations
- Enforcement: `npm run check:no-supabase` blocks violations (runs in pre-commit hook)

## MAIA Sovereignty

- Primary AI: Claude (Anthropic) via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Fallback: Local Ollama (DeepSeek models) when API unavailable
- Never use OpenAI or other cloud AI providers
- Voice: Local TTS/STT or browser APIs only
- Data: Local PostgreSQL, never cloud databases

## Sanctuary Mode (Memory Consent)

MAIA supports **Sanctuary sessions** — conversations that remain useful in the moment but do not enter long-term memory.

### Invariants

1. **No content retention** — Sanctuary sessions are not stored, indexed, or used for pattern formation
2. **No training data** — Sanctuary content never enters any model training pipeline
3. **Minimal metadata** — Only log that a sanctuary session occurred (timestamp, duration) — never content
4. **Visual clarity** — User must see unambiguous indication that Sanctuary is active
5. **Default off** — Regular sessions build memory; Sanctuary is an explicit opt-in
6. **Irreversible per-session** — Once a session is Sanctuary, it cannot be retroactively converted to remembered

### Why This Exists

Real honesty requires safety. People won't speak freely to a system that might later monetize or weaponize their vulnerability.

Sanctuary is the architectural proof that MAIA serves the person — not the data model.

### UI Copy

**Toggle:**
> Sanctuary Mode — This session won't be remembered. Speak freely.

**Learn more:**
> Sanctuary sessions are useful in the moment, then gone. No patterns formed. No memories stored. Just presence.

## Architecture

- This is a Next.js 16 app using Turbopack
- Voice modes: Talk (dialogue), Care (counsel), Note (scribe)
- Processing paths: FAST (<2s), CORE (2-6s), DEEP (6-20s)
- Consciousness framework: Spiralogic (see `/lib/maia/spiralogicReference.ts`)

## Before Making Changes

1. Search codebase for existing implementations
2. Run `npm run check:no-supabase` to verify no Supabase violations
3. Run `npm run preflight` for full sovereignty check
4. Test with `npm run smoke` before committing

## Setup (New Clones)

After cloning this repo, run once:
```bash
./scripts/setup-githooks.sh
```

This configures versioned git hooks that enforce sovereignty on every commit.
