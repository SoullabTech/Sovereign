  "claudeResponse": "It's completely understandable to feel uncertain during times of transition. Many people go through periods where they question their path and sense of self. These transitions can be challenging, but they can also be opportunities for growth and discovery.\n\nDuring transitional phases, it's common to experience:\n- Discomfort with the \"in-between\" space\n- Questioning of previously held beliefs or values\n- Uncertainty about direction\n- Feeling of fragmentation in identity\n- Temporary loss of meaning or purpose\n\nSome approaches that might help:\n- Acknowledge that it's okay not to have all the answers\n- Allow yourself to be curious about what might be possible\n- Experiment with different activities or roles to discover what resonates\n- Notice how your values might evolve over time\n- Connect with others who are navigating similar changes\n- Consider what aspects of your identity feel most authentic to you\n\nWould you like to explore any particular aspect of this transition in more detail?",
