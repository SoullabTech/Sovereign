## Training Notes

**Use Case**:
- [ ] Runtime few-shot example
- [ ] Fine-tuning data
- [ ] Prompt engineering guidance
- [ ] Rupture repair training
- [ ] Depth calibration example

**Pattern Category**:
- [ ] Perfect attunement
- [ ] Clean repair
- [ ] Depth calibration
- [ ] Sovereignty embodied
- [ ] Invitation mastery
- [ ] Illumination gentle

**Integration Priority**:
- [ ] High (core to MAIA's essence)
