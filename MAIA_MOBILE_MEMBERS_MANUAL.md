## 🌱 GETTING THE MOST FROM YOUR JOURNEY

### **Radical Honesty**
The transformation happens in proportion to your willingness to be authentic and vulnerable. Share your real thoughts, feelings, fears, and desires.

### **Pattern Recognition**
Look for themes across sessions. MAIA will help you recognize patterns, but conscious awareness accelerates transformation.

### **Integration Practice**
Apply insights to real-world situations. Consciousness work without embodied action remains intellectual.

Share appropriate insights with others. Your healing contributes to collective awakening.

### **Sacred Patience**
Transformation occurs in spirals, not linear progression. Trust the process and honor your unique timing.
