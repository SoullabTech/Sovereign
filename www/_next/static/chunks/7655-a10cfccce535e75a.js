DreamWeaver phenomenological practice to help you record, remember, and relate dreams across time.\n\n## Step 1: Immediate Dream Capture\n**Within 5 minutes of waking:**\n1. Open MAIA on your mobile device (optimal for bedside recording)\n2. Navigate to LabTools \u2192 Dreams & Unconscious\n3. Tap \"Record New Dream\"\n4. Use voice-to-text or type your dream immediately\n\n## Step 2: Core Dream Elements\n**Essential information to capture:**\n- **Dream Content**: Raw dream narrative (don't edit or analyze)\n- **Emotional Tone**: Primary emotions experienced\n- **Vividness**: Scale 1-10 how clear/vivid the dream was\n- **Lucidity Level**: Scale 0-10 how aware you were of dreaming\n- **Sleep Quality**: How well you slept (affects dream processing)\n- **Time Context**: Approximate time you woke, time in bed\n\n## Step 3: Let MAIA's AI Analyze\n**DreamWeaver Engine automatically detects:**\n- **Jungian Archetypes**: 19+ archetypal patterns (hero, shadow, anima, etc.)\n- **Wisdom Emergence**: Body activation, language shifts, energy markers\n- **Elemental Patterns**: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Aether consciousness flows\n- **Transformation Markers**: Crisis navigation, breakthrough indicators\n- **Shadow Work**: Integration opportunities and resistance patterns\n\n## Step 4: Review Analysis Results\n**MAIA provides sophisticated insights:**\n- Primary and secondary archetypes present\n- Wisdom emergence signals detected\n- Elemental consciousness patterns\n- Cross-correlation with waking consciousness states\n- Integration recommendations and follow-up questions\n\n## Step 5: Ongoing Integration\n**Daily and weekly practices:**\n- Review dream patterns in your personal dashboard\n- Explore archetypal progression over time\n- Notice correlations between dreams and daily consciousness states\n- Use MAIA's recommendations for shadow work and integration\n- Ask MAIA follow-up questions about dream meanings and patterns\n",tags:["dream-recording","archetypal-analysis","voice-to-text","dream-capture"],relatedTechnologies:["maia-oracle","alchemical-detection","elemental-circulation"]},{id:"archetypal-analysis-guide",title:"Understanding Archetypal Dream Analysis",description:"Deep dive into MAIA's sophisticated Jungian archetypal interpretation system",content:"\n# Understanding MAIA's Archetypal Dream Analysis\n\n## The Archetypal Framework\nMAIA uses a comprehensive 19+ archetype system based on Jungian psychology:\n\n### Core Archetypal Categories:\n\n**Primary Archetypes:**\n- **Hero**: Journey, courage, overcoming obstacles\n- **Shadow**: Repressed aspects, integration work needed\n- **Anima/Animus**: Inner feminine/masculine, soul connection\n- **Wise Old Man/Woman**: Guidance, wisdom, mentorship\n- **Mother/Father**: Nurturing, authority, protection\n\n**Transformation Archetypes:**\n- **Magician**: Transformation, manifestation, power\n- **Ruler**: Authority, responsibility, leadership\n- **Rebel**: Revolution, breaking patterns, authentic change\n- **Creator**: Innovation, artistic expression, bringing forth\n\n**Relational Archetypes:**\n- **Lover**: Connection, passion, union\n- **Caregiver**: Service, compassion, healing\n- **Child**: Innocence, wonder, new beginnings\n- **Maiden**: Fresh starts, potential, receptivity\n\n**Wisdom Archetypes:**\n- **Sage**: Knowledge, understanding, teaching\n- **Seeker**: Quest, exploration, spiritual journey\n- **Trickster**: Paradox, humor, breaking conventions\n- **Destroyer**: Necessary endings, clearing, death/rebirth\n\n## How MAIA Analyzes Your Dreams\n\n**1.
