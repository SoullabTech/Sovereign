# Memory You Can Trust

Most AI assistants say they "remember," but they don't show their work. MAIA does — but we don't perform transparency *at* you. Your conversation feels intimate by default. If you want to see the receipts (how many past exchanges were used, how many characters, whether anything was truncated), they're always available: just tap the ⓘ icon next to any response.

We also run an automated certification script to verify three things: (1) your conversation history persists across server restarts, (2) memory injection can be proven on demand, and (3) on a cold start—when no memory is available—MAIA won't invent your name or pretend it remembers details it doesn't have. Latest run: **14/14 tests passing**.

## What This Means for You

During beta, you can rely on three guarantees:

1. **Your conversation history persists** across restarts and technical issues
2. **The receipts are always available** — tap the ⓘ icon on any message to see exactly what memory was used
3. **No name fabrication** — if MAIA doesn't know your name yet, it won't invent one
