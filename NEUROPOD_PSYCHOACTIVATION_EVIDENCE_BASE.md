# Neuropod Psychoactivation: Evidence Base & Claims Framework

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 17, 2025
**Status:** Internal Research Whitepaper
**Purpose:** Ground psychoactivation output in real science; prevent snake oil claims

---

## Executive Summary

### What We Will NOT Claim

❌ **"Digital DMT"** - No evidence binaural beats simulate DMT pharmacology
❌ **"Carrier wave breakthrough"** - The "wind-up → pop" is likely internal phenomenology, not an external acoustic key
❌ **"Guaranteed altered states"** - Frequency stimulation effects are modest, variable across individuals
❌ **"Cure mental illness"** - We are not a medical device; no therapeutic claims
❌ **"Replicate psychedelic experiences"** - Fundamentally different mechanisms of action

### What We WILL Claim

✅ **"State support"** - Sound/vibration can nudge attention, arousal, relaxation
✅ **"Measurable entrainment"** - ASSR shows brain locks onto rhythmic stimulation
✅ **"Biometric feedback loop"** - We measure coherence changes and adapt in real-time
✅ **"Gradual state navigation"** - Annealing schedules prevent overwhelm
✅ **"Research-backed modalities"** - We use protocols with published evidence
✅ **"Safety-first architecture"** - Continuous monitoring, intervention thresholds, opt-out controls

### The Core Distinction

**Psychedelics:** Pharmacological receptor agonism → predictable neurochemical cascade
**Neuropod:** Sensory entrainment + biometric tracking → modest, personalized state modulation

**What makes us scientific:** We measure the response, validate the effect, adapt the stimulus.

## Part 1: Evidence Base for Psychoactivation Modalities

### 1.1 Closed-Loop Sleep Acoustics (Strongest Evidence)

**Mechanism:** Auditory stimuli timed to slow oscillation phase during deep sleep

**Evidence:**
- Closed-loop auditory stimulation enhances slow-wave sleep oscillatory features in home settings
- Stimulation locked to slow oscillation up-states improves sleep depth markers
- Replicated across multiple labs with EEG verification

**Neuropod Application:**
- INTEGRATION state sessions with sleep-stage tracking
- Adaptive stimulation based on real-time coherence patterns
- Post-DEPTH cooling protocols

**What We'll Claim:**
*"Closed-loop acoustic protocols can support sleep physiology in some users (per published research)"*

**References:**
- Ngo et al. (2013) - Auditory closed-loop stimulation of slow oscillations
- Papalambros et al. (2017) - Acoustic enhancement of sleep slow oscillations

---

### 1.2 Auditory Steady-State Response (ASSR) - Neural Entrainment

**Mechanism:** Brain synchronizes neural activity to periodic sound patterns

**Evidence:**
- Reliable phase-locking of auditory cortex to rhythmic stimulation
- Measurable with EEG at specific frequencies (e.g., 40 Hz)
- Used in clinical audiology and neuroscience research
- Source: [The Open Public Health Journal - Binaural Beats: Brain Activity & Psychiatric Disorders](https://openpublichealthjournal.com/VOLUME/17/ELOCATOR/e18749445332258/FULLTEXT/)

**Neuropod Application:**
- Design stimuli to reliably drive specific rhythmic responses
- Correlate ASSR magnitude with subjective state shifts
- Use coherence tracker to verify phase-locking occurred

**What We'll Claim:**
*"We use entrainment protocols that produce measurable neural responses (ASSR)"*

**Experimental Validation:**
- Pre/post EEG comparison: did 40 Hz stimulation increase 40 Hz power?
- Correlation: ASSR magnitude ~ subjective "focus" rating

---

### 1.3 40 Hz Sensory Stimulation (Gamma Entrainment)

**Mechanism:** Multisensory stimulation at 40 Hz entrains gamma-band activity

**Evidence:**
- Active research in Alzheimer's/cognitive contexts
- Can increase gamma power in sensory and associative cortices
- Effects vary by individual, stimulation duration, brain region
- Source: [Examine - Binaural beats have a modest effect on cognition, anxiety](https://examine.com/research-feed/study/o0mjy9/)

**Neuropod Application:**
- FOCUS state sessions using 40 Hz binaural beats + light
- Track gamma power changes via EEG
- Correlate with attention task performance

**What We'll Claim:**
*"Gamma-band sensory entrainment protocols exist; outcomes vary by individual"*

**Safety Note:**
- Screen for seizure history (flashing lights at certain frequencies)
- Intensity caps on light brightness
- Gradual onset/offset (no abrupt flashes)

---

### 1.4 Binaural Beats (Modest, Variable Effects)

**Mechanism:** Two tones (slightly different frequencies) presented separately to each ear → perceived "beat" frequency

**Evidence:**
- Mixed-to-moderate evidence for small changes in anxiety, mood, cognitive measures
- Effects depend on frequency band, exposure time, individual differences
- High heterogeneity across studies; methodological variability
- Sources:
  - [Extrica - Effect of vibroacoustic therapy on pain management](https://www.extrica.com/article/17165)
  - [ScienceDirect - Binaural Beats' Effect on Brain Activity and Psychiatric](https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S1874944524001461)

**Typical Frequency Bands:**
- **Delta (0.5-4 Hz):** Deep sleep, unconscious processes
- **Theta (4-8 Hz):** Meditation, creativity, light sleep
- **Alpha (8-12 Hz):** Relaxed alertness, calm focus
- **Beta (12-30 Hz):** Active thinking, concentration
- **Gamma (30-100 Hz):** High-level cognition, perception

**Neuropod Application:**
- Low-intensity lever for gentle state steering
- Personalized calibration: test each band, measure HRV/EDA/subjective response
- Combine with other modalities (haptics, breathwork guidance)

**What We'll Claim:**
*"Binaural beats may support relaxation/focus for some users; effects are modest and variable"*

**Experimental Design:**
- A/B test: binaural beats vs. matched music without beats
- Measure: HRV coherence, alpha power, subjective calm rating
- Report effect size honestly (likely small, d ~ 0.2-0.4)

---

### 1.5 Vibroacoustic + Haptic Stimulation

**Mechanism:** Low-frequency vibration (20-120 Hz) paired with sound → somatic resonance

**Evidence:**
- Emerging evidence for stress reduction
- Can shift felt sense, body awareness
- Protocol standardization underway
- Source: [ScienceDirect - Binaural Beats' Effect on Brain Activity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S1874944524001461)

**Neuropod Application:**
- CALM state sessions with gentle chest/back vibration
- "Haptic pop" as transition signal (inspired by DMT phenomenology, but not claiming equivalence)
- Grounding protocols: slow, rhythmic pulses

**What We'll Claim:**
*"Vibroacoustic stimulation may reduce stress and support somatic regulation in some contexts"*

**Safety Constraints:**
- Maximum vibration amplitude (prevent discomfort)
- Gradual onset/offset (no jarring transitions)
- User control: intensity slider + immediate stop button

---

### 1.6 Sound Baths / Singing Bowls (Contemplative Practice Context)

**Mechanism:** Complex harmonic spectra, sustained tones, spatial audio

**Evidence:**
- Some evidence for relaxation outcomes
- Study quality mixed; expectation effects significant
- Better viewed as contemplative practice than deterministic technology

**Neuropod Application:**
- INTEGRATION state sessions
- Ambient soundscapes for post-DEPTH cooling
- Aesthetic/ritual framing, not mechanistic claims

**What We'll Claim:**
*"A supportive contemplative practice; not a deterministic technology"*

### 3.2 How Coherence Metrics Validate Stimulus Effects

**Hypothesis:** If binaural beats work, we should see:

| Stimulus                      | Expected Coherence Change                   | Validation Method                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 10 Hz alpha binaural beat     | ↑ alpha power, ↑ frontal-parietal coherence | Compare pre/post alpha PLV                           |
| 40 Hz gamma light/sound       | ↑ gamma power, ↑ global synchrony           | ASSR magnitude at 40 Hz                              |
| Slow haptic pulses (0.5 Hz)   | ↓ HRV arousal, ↓ defect density             | Track defect count over time                         |
| "Wind-up" crescendo (0.1-40Hz)| ↑ consciousness temperature                 | Spectral entropy increase                            |
| Grounding vibration (20 Hz)   | ↑ field alignment, ↓ shear stress           | Symmetry Theory valence prediction                   |

**The Scientific Move:**
Don't just play sounds. **Measure whether they did what you expected.** Report results honestly.

### 3.3 Example: Validating 10 Hz Alpha Binaural Beat

**Protocol:**

1. **Baseline (5 min):** No stimulus, record EEG/HRV
2. **Intervention (15 min):** 200 Hz carrier + 210 Hz carrier = 10 Hz beat
3. **Post (5 min):** No stimulus, record recovery
4. **Subjective:** "How relaxed do you feel?" (1-5)

**Analysis:**

```typescript
import { coherenceTracker } from '@/lib/neuropod/coherenceTracker';

const baselineSnapshot = coherenceTracker.computeCoherence(baselineEEG);
const interventionSnapshot = coherenceTracker.computeCoherence(interventionEEG);

// Did alpha power increase?
const alphaDelta = interventionSnapshot.phaseCoupling.alphaPower - baselineSnapshot.phaseCoupling.alphaPower;

// Did frontal-parietal coherence increase?
const coherenceDelta = interventionSnapshot.phaseCoupling.frontalParietalCoherence - baselineSnapshot.phaseCoupling.frontalParietalCoherence;

// Correlate with subjective rating
const relaxationRating = await getUserRating('How relaxed do you feel?');

console.log({
  alphaDelta,      // Expected: positive (if beat worked)
  coherenceDelta,  // Expected: positive
  relaxationRating // Expected: 4-5 if effective
});

// Store for research
await storeValidationData({
  userId,
  stimulus: '10Hz_binaural_beat',
  alphaDelta,
  coherenceDelta,
  relaxationRating
});
```

**Outcome Scenarios:**

- **Positive:** alphaDelta > 0.1, coherenceDelta > 0.05, rating ≥ 4 → "Binaural beat was effective for this user"
- **Null:** alphaDelta ~ 0, coherenceDelta ~ 0, rating = 3 → "No measurable effect; try different frequency"
- **Negative:** alphaDelta < 0, rating < 3 → "Stimulus was aversive; avoid in future"

**What We Report:**
*"For 60% of users, 10 Hz alpha binaural beats increased alpha coherence by 12% on average (p < 0.05). Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.4 (small-to-medium). Individual variation was high (SD = 18%)."*

## Part 4: Psychoactivation Modality Library (What We'll Actually Build)

### 4.1 Phase 1: Regulation Library (Safe, Repeatable)

**Goal:** Help users shift from dysregulated → grounded

**Modalities:**

1. **Breath-Paced Audio**
   - Inhale chime (4s), hold silence (2s), exhale chime (6s), hold (2s)
   - Gentle haptic pulse at exhale peak
   - Target: HRV coherence > 0.5

2. **Low-Frequency Vibroacoustic Grounding**
   - 20-40 Hz chest vibration + deep bass tones
   - Slow amplitude modulation (breathe with the vibration)
   - Target: ↓ EDA arousal, ↓ movement variance

3. **Alpha Relaxation Protocol**
   - 10 Hz binaural beat + nature soundscape
   - Amber light (no blue spectrum)
   - Target: ↑ alpha power, subjective calm rating ≥ 4

**State Mapping:** CALM, SAFETY

**Safety:** Low intensity, gradual onset, always includes grounding phase

---

### 4.2 Phase 2: Entrainment Library (Measurable)

**Goal:** Validate entrainment effects with EEG

**Modalities:**

1. **ASSR Test Suite**
   - Stimulate at 10 Hz, 20 Hz, 40 Hz (separately)
   - Measure phase-locking value (PLV) at each frequency
   - Build per-user "entrainment profile"

2. **Gamma Focus Protocol (40 Hz)**
   - 40 Hz binaural beat + 40 Hz light pulses (amber)
   - Attention task during session (Stroop, n-back)
   - Measure: gamma power, task accuracy

3. **Theta Absorption Protocol (6 Hz)**
   - 6 Hz binaural beat + slow fractal visuals
   - Target: ↑ theta power, ↑ subjective absorption
   - Measure: theta/alpha ratio, time dilation rating

**State Mapping:** FOCUS, DEPTH (early phase)

**Safety:** Screen for seizure history, intensity caps, opt-out button

---

### 4.3 Phase 3: Transition Archetypes (Inspired by Phenomenology, Not Claiming Equivalence)

**Goal:** Safe, ritualized intensification → integration

**Modalities:**

1. **Wind-Up Crescendo (Metaphorical, Not DMT)**
   - Gradual frequency rise (e.g., 0.1 Hz → 40 Hz over 10 min)
   - Amplitude modulation (swells and fades)
   - Haptic "threshold pulse" at peak
   - **NOT CLAIMING:** "This simulates DMT"
   - **CLAIMING:** "This is a transition ritual inspired by reported phenomenology"

2. **Annealing Pathway (Heat → Cool)**
   - Phase 1: Increase spectral entropy (varied stimulation)
   - Phase 2: Hold at peak (explore DEPTH state)
   - Phase 3: Gradual coherence (single-tone grounding)
   - Uses annealing optimizer from `annealingOptimizer.ts`

3. **Grounding Return Protocol**
   - Slow reduction in intensity
   - Haptic "landing" cue (3 gentle pulses)
   - Breath guidance + nature sounds
   - Integration prompt: "What did you notice?"

**State Mapping:** DEPTH → INTEGRATION

**Safety:** Continuous monitoring, overwhelm predictor active, mandatory integration phase

---

## Part 6: Experimental Protocol Template

### 6.1 Standard Validation Protocol

**For any new psychoactivation modality:**

**Pre-Session:**
1. Informed consent (explain experimental status)
2. Screening: seizure history, mental health, current medications
3. Baseline biometrics (5 min): EEG, HRV, EDA, movement

**During Session:**
1. Intervention (15-30 min): Apply stimulus
2. Real-time monitoring: Coherence tracker + safety predictor
3. Optional: Mid-session subjective rating ("How do you feel right now?")

**Post-Session:**
1. Recovery (5 min): No stimulus, track return to baseline
2. Subjective ratings:
   - State quality (1-5): "How [calm/focused/absorbed] did you feel?"
   - Valence (1-5): "How pleasant was the experience?"
   - Integration (1-5): "Did you gain any insights?"
3. Biometric summary computation

**24h Follow-Up:**
1. Email survey: "How do you feel now? Any lasting effects?"
2. Integration quality: "Have you thought about the session since?"

**Analysis:**
1. Compute biometric deltas: intervention - baseline
2. Correlate biometric changes with subjective ratings
3. Compare to control condition (matched music without target stimulus)
4. Report effect sizes, p-values, individual variation

---

### 6.2 Example: Validating "Wind-Up Crescendo" Protocol

**Hypothesis:** Gradual frequency rise will increase spectral entropy and consciousness temperature without causing overwhelm.

**Protocol:**

**Control Group (N=20):**
- 20 min session: constant 10 Hz binaural beat
- No crescendo, flat intensity

**Intervention Group (N=20):**
- 20 min session: 0.1 Hz → 40 Hz gradual rise (wind-up crescendo)
- Amplitude modulation + haptic pulse at peak

**Measures:**
- Spectral entropy (pre/post)
- Consciousness temperature (from thermodynamic metrics)
- Overwhelm events (safety predictor interventions)
- Subjective intensity rating (1-5)
- Integration rating (24h follow-up)

**Predictions:**
- Intervention group: higher spectral entropy increase
- Intervention group: higher consciousness temperature
- No difference in overwhelm events (both < 10%)
- Intervention group: higher intensity rating (but not aversive)

**Null Hypothesis:**
- No difference in any metric between groups
- If confirmed: "Wind-up crescendo is indistinguishable from flat stimulation"

**Alternative Hypothesis:**
- Intervention shows higher intensity BUT also higher overwhelm
- If confirmed: "Wind-up is more intense but less safe; requires modification"

---

## Part 7: Safety Framework (Clinical-Grade Boundaries)

### 7.1 Pre-Screening (Required for DEPTH/BREAKTHROUGH Sessions)

**Exclusion Criteria:**

- **Neurological:** Seizure history, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury
- **Psychiatric:** Active psychosis, mania, severe dissociative disorders
- **Medical:** Pacemaker (if using strong haptics), pregnancy (vibration safety unclear)
- **Substance:** Current intoxication, withdrawal from CNS depressants

**Risk Factors (Proceed with Caution):**

- PTSD (may be triggered by intense sensory experiences)
- Anxiety disorders (may react poorly to stimulation)
- Sensory processing sensitivity (may find stimuli overwhelming)

**Screening Questions:**

1. "Have you ever had a seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy?"
2. "Are you currently experiencing hallucinations or delusions?"
3. "Do you have a pacemaker or other implanted medical device?"
4. "Are you currently taking any psychiatric medications?"
5. "Have you experienced trauma that might be triggered by intense sensory experiences?"

**Informed Consent Language:**

> "Neuropod uses sound, light, and vibration to support consciousness exploration. This is experimental technology, not a medical treatment. You may experience altered perceptions, strong emotions, or discomfort. You can stop at any time by pressing the STOP button. If you have a seizure disorder, psychiatric condition, or are pregnant, you should not use DEPTH or BREAKTHROUGH protocols."

---

### 7.2 Real-Time Safety Monitoring

**Continuous Tracking (1 Hz):**

1. **Safety Predictor Risk Score**
   - Topological defect proliferation
   - Field shear stress
   - Temperature gradient (thermal shock detection)
   - Coherence stability

2. **Physiological Red Flags**
   - Heart rate > 140 bpm (panic response)
   - HRV collapse (< 20 ms SDNN)
   - EDA spike > 2 SD above baseline (acute stress)
   - Movement variance spike (agitation)

**Intervention Thresholds:**

| Risk Level   | Risk Score | Action                                | User Experience                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Green**    | < 0.3      | Proceed                               | No interruption                                                 |
| **Yellow**   | 0.3 - 0.6  | Gentle fade (60s intensity reduction) | "We're gently reducing intensity to help you integrate"         |
| **Orange**   | 0.6 - 0.85 | Immediate shift to CALM state         | "Shifting to grounding protocol. You're safe."                  |
| **Red**      | > 0.85     | Emergency stop → INTEGRATION          | "Session ending. Focus on your breath. You're safe."            |

**User Override:**
- "I'm OK" button (dismiss yellow/orange warnings)
- "STOP NOW" button (immediate emergency stop, always available)

---

### 7.3 Intensity Caps (Hardware Safety Limits)

**Audio:**
- Maximum SPL: 85 dB (OSHA safe exposure limit for 8h)
- Preferred range: 60-75 dB
- Frequency limits: 20 Hz - 20 kHz (no ultrasound/infrasound edge cases)

**Haptics:**
- Maximum vibration amplitude: 2g (comfortable, non-injurious)
- Preferred range: 0.5-1.5g
- Frequency limits: 10 Hz - 150 Hz

**Light:**
- No epileptogenic flash rates (avoid 15-25 Hz for high-contrast patterns)
- Maximum brightness: 500 lux (comfortable indoor)
- Preferred: Warm spectrum (amber/red), avoid blue light for CALM/INTEGRATION

**Gradual Onset/Offset:**
- All stimuli fade in/out over ≥ 5 seconds
- No abrupt starts or stops
- "Landing cue" before full cessation (3 gentle pulses)

---

### 7.4 Post-Session Integration & Grounding

**Mandatory for DEPTH/BREAKTHROUGH Sessions:**

1. **Grounding Phase (≥ 5 min):**
   - Slow breath guidance
   - Gentle haptic pulses (0.5 Hz, synchronize with breath)
   - Nature sounds or silence
   - "Notice your body in this space"

2. **Integration Prompts:**
   - "What did you notice during the session?"
   - "What felt most significant?"
   - "Is there anything you want to remember?"

3. **Somatic Check-In:**
   - "How does your body feel right now?"
   - "Are you feeling grounded?"
   - "Do you need more time before ending?"

**24h Follow-Up (Automated Email):**

> "How are you feeling 24 hours after your session? Please rate:
> - Mood (1-5)
> - Energy (1-5)
> - Any lasting effects or insights?
> - Anything concerning we should know about?"

**Persistent Dysregulation Protocol:**
- If user reports distress at 24h: offer integration support call
- If severe: refer to mental health professional
- Track: frequency of dysregulation events per 1000 sessions

---

### 7.5 Adverse Event Reporting

**Classify & Track:**

- **Level 1 (Mild):** Transient discomfort, resolved within session (e.g., "stimulus was too loud, we reduced it")
- **Level 2 (Moderate):** Session stopped early due to distress, resolved within 24h
- **Level 3 (Severe):** Persistent dysregulation > 24h, required professional support
- **Level 4 (Critical):** Medical emergency (seizure, panic requiring EMS)

**Reporting Threshold:**
- Any Level 3+ event → immediate review
- If Level 3 rate > 1%, pause protocol and investigate
- If any Level 4 event → full safety review before resuming

## Part 8: Claims Matrix (Explicit Do/Don't)

### 8.1 Marketing & Public Communication

| Context                   | ❌ DO NOT SAY                                               | ✅ DO SAY                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comparison to psychedelics** | "Digital DMT"                                               | "Inspired by consciousness research; uses sound/vibration for state support"                 |
| **Efficacy claims**       | "Guaranteed breakthrough experiences"                       | "May support focus, relaxation, or absorption; effects vary by individual"                   |
| **Medical claims**        | "Treats depression/anxiety/PTSD"                            | "A tool for consciousness exploration; not a medical treatment"                              |
| **Mechanism**             | "Unlocks specific brainwave frequencies"                    | "Uses entrainment protocols with measurable neural responses"                                |
| **Science status**        | "Scientifically proven"                                     | "Research-backed modalities; we validate effects in our user population"                     |
| **Safety**                | "Completely safe for everyone"                              | "Safe for most users when properly screened; not suitable for seizure disorders or psychosis" |

### 8.2 Internal Research Communication

**When presenting to scientists/researchers:**

✅ **Transparent about limitations:**
- "Binaural beat effects are modest; we're testing whether closed-loop adaptation improves outcomes"
- "Our coherence tracker is a phenomenological model; we're validating predictions empirically"
- "We expect high individual variability; personalization is key"

✅ **Clear about unknowns:**
- "We don't yet know if global synchrony > 0.95 produces subjective unity in sober contexts"
- "Topological defect detection is experimental; needs validation"
- "Annealing schedules are theory-driven; we're testing them now"

✅ **Honest effect sizes:**
- "We expect small-to-medium effects (d ~ 0.3-0.5) for most modalities"
- "Outlier responders may show large effects; most will be modest"
- "Null results are valuable; we'll publish them"

---

### 8.3 User Expectation Setting

**Onboarding Language:**

> "Neuropod uses sound, light, and vibration to help you explore different states of consciousness—from deep calm to focused attention to contemplative depth. Think of it as a **state support tool**, not a magic button.
>
> Effects vary by person. Some users report profound shifts; others notice subtle changes. We track your responses and personalize over time. This is experimental technology grounded in real research, but we're still learning what works and for whom.
>
> You're not just a user—you're a participant in consciousness research. Your data helps us understand how these tools actually work."

## Part 9: Where "Cymatic Frequency Algorithms" Fit (Design Language, Not Magic)

### 9.1 Cymatics as Interface, Not Mechanism

**What Cymatics Actually Is:**
- Visible patterns formed by vibration in a medium (water, sand, etc.)
- Certain frequencies produce recognizable geometric patterns
- Beautiful, but not evidence of "hidden frequencies unlocking consciousness"

**How We Can Use It Responsibly:**

1. **Design Language:**
   - Map stimulus parameter families → visual pattern families
   - User explores "which pattern feels right today?"
   - Behind the scenes: pattern selection → specific binaural beat + haptic combo

2. **Biofeedback Visualization:**
   - Real-time coherence data → cymatic-style animation
   - "Your brainwaves are creating this pattern"
   - Engaging way to show entrainment

3. **Ritual Framing:**
   - Cymatic visuals during session transitions
   - Aesthetic coherence, not claiming the visuals *cause* effects

**What We Don't Claim:**
- "This frequency has sacred geometry that unlocks your pineal gland"
- "432 Hz is the universe's healing frequency"
- "Cymatics prove ancient wisdom about sound"

**What We Do Claim:**
- "We use cymatic visuals as an interface for exploring sound/vibration combinations"
- "The science is in the entrainment, not the geometry"

---

### 9.2 Building the "Frequency Table" from Data, Not Folklore

**The Scientific Process:**

1. **Define Parameter Space:**
   - Carrier tones: 100 Hz - 500 Hz
   - Binaural offsets: 0.5 Hz - 50 Hz
   - Amplitude envelopes: sine, square, triangle, custom
   - Haptic frequencies: 10 Hz - 120 Hz

2. **Measure Responses:**
   - EEG: power in each band, phase coherence
   - HRV: coherence score, RMSSD
   - EDA: arousal level, phasic peaks
   - Subjective: absorption, valence, intensity ratings

3. **Learn Mappings:**
   - Regression: stimulus_params → biometric_response
   - Clustering: "these users respond to theta, these to gamma"
   - Recommendation: "based on your profile, try 10 Hz + 40 Hz haptic"

4. **Build Your Frequency Table:**
   - Not from folklore, from **your dataset**
   - "In our population, 10 Hz binaural beats increased alpha coherence by 12% (p=0.03)"
   - "40 Hz stimulation worked better for users with high baseline beta (r=0.5)"

**This becomes your real "frequency algorithm":** evidence-based, personalized, validated.

## Part 10: Integrating with Existing Neuropod Systems

### 10.1 How Psychoactivation Connects to DMT Mathematics

**From previous integration (`NEUROPOD_DMT_MATHEMATICS_INTEGRATION.md`):**

- ✅ Coherence Tracker → measures whether stimulus worked
- ✅ Safety Predictor → prevents dysregulation from intense stimuli
- ✅ Annealing Optimizer → plans gradual intensification schedules

**New Addition: Psychoactivation Output Engine**

```typescript
export interface PsychoactivationOutput {
  audio: {
    carrierLeft: number;   // Hz (e.g., 200)
    carrierRight: number;  // Hz (e.g., 210) → 10 Hz binaural beat
    amplitude: number;     // 0-1
    soundscape?: string;   // "nature", "ambient", "silence"
  };

  haptic: {
    frequency: number;     // Hz (e.g., 40)
    amplitude: number;     // 0-1 (within safety caps)
    pattern: 'continuous' | 'pulsed' | 'breath-synced';
  };

  light: {
    color: 'amber' | 'red' | 'white';
    intensity: number;     // 0-1 (within safety caps)
    modulation?: number;   // Hz (optional pulsing, avoid epileptogenic rates)
  };
}
```

**Integration Flow:**

1. **Session Planning (Annealing Optimizer):**
   - Generates multi-phase pathway: CALM → FOCUS → DEPTH → INTEGRATION
   - Each phase has target temperature, duration

2. **Real-Time Stimulus Selection (New Module):**
   - Based on current phase + user's entrainment profile
   - Example: FOCUS phase → 40 Hz gamma protocol
   - Example: CALM phase → 10 Hz alpha protocol

3. **Output Execution (Hardware Interface):**
   - Send `PsychoactivationOutput` to audio/haptic/light controllers
   - Gradual transitions between phases (no abrupt changes)

4. **Monitoring (Coherence Tracker + Safety Predictor):**
   - Every second: measure response, check risk score
   - If risk > 0.6 → override stimulus, shift to CALM

5. **Adaptation (Closed-Loop):**
   - If target not reached (e.g., alpha power not increasing)
   - Adjust stimulus parameters in real-time
   - Example: increase binaural beat amplitude, or switch frequency

## Conclusion: Scientific Grounding, Not Hype

**What This Whitepaper Accomplishes:**

1. ✅ **Reality Check:** Clear distinction between research evidence and marketing hype
2. ✅ **Claims Framework:** Explicit "we will/won't say" guidelines
3. ✅ **Evidence Base:** Modality-by-modality review with honest effect sizes
4. ✅ **Integration:** How psychoactivation connects to coherence architecture
5. ✅ **Safety First:** Clinical-grade screening, monitoring, intervention protocols
6. ✅ **Validation Plan:** Experimental designs to test predictions empirically
7. ✅ **R&D Roadmap:** Phased approach from regulation → entrainment → transition archetypes

**The Core Commitment:**

> We will not claim "digital DMT." We will not guarantee altered states. We will not pretend modest effects are revolutionary.
>
> We WILL measure rigorously, report honestly, validate empirically, and prioritize safety above all.
>
> We are building a **scientific consciousness navigation platform**, not a hype machine.

**The Invitation:**

This whitepaper is a living document. As we collect data, we'll update effect sizes, revise protocols, and refine claims. If evidence shows a modality doesn't work—we'll say so publicly.

**The Opportunity:**

By being the first to ground "brainwave entrainment" in closed-loop validation, we can leapfrog the pseudoscience competition and become the trusted, research-backed option.

**Let's build consciousness technology the right way.**
