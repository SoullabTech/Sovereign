# Devlog Templates & Daily Ritual

A complete guide to capturing, exporting, and sharing your daily build work.

---

## Daily Ritual: 7 minutes + tiny notes

### Morning (2 min) — Journal Thread

Write 3 lines:

1. **Today I'm focusing on:** ________
2. **Constraint / unknown:** ________
3. **Keep it simple by:** ________

Optional: **Save + Ask MAIA** → get guidance.

### During the day (10 sec each) — Capture Mode

**Start Capture** when you begin work (`⌘⇧R`).
Add notes as you go using tags:

| Tag | Use when... |
|-----|-------------|
| **SHIP** | finished + real |
| **FIX** | repaired / stabilized |
| **DECISION** | chose direction |
| **BLOCKED** | stuck / needs input |
| **NEXT** | next action |

**Best note formula:**
`TAG: verb + object + why it matters`

Example: "SHIP: Export to Descript chapters — editing is 5x faster."

---

### End of day (5 min) — Export + Post

Export from Capture Mode:
- **Descript Chapters** → paste into Descript markers
- **Patreon Draft** → paste as your post skeleton

## Voice 1: Patreon Devlog (intimate + mythopoetic)

**Title line (say it):**
"Devlog — *(Date)* — *(one-line outcome)*"

**Opening (10–15s):**
"Hey beloved ones — today was a real build day. I stayed close to the work, and I want to share what actually moved."

**The thread (15–25s):**
"The thread I followed was: *[one intention]*.
The thing I had to meet was: *[one constraint]*."

**What shipped (20–30s):**
"What landed in reality:
* *[SHIP 1]*
* *[SHIP 2]*

And one quiet but important fix: *[FIX]*."

**The lesson / meaning (15–25s):**
"The deeper lesson was: *[one learning]*.
It's one of those moments where the system teaches you how it wants to be built."

**What's next (10–15s):**
"Next I'm moving into: *[NEXT]*."

**Member invitation (10–15s):**
"If you're walking with me, tell me what you want to see next: *[Option A]* or *[Option B]* — and if you have a story or a need this could serve, drop it in the comments."
