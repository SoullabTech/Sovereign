## 📊 Cultural Diversity Metrics

### 1. Cultural Variety Score
**Calculation**: Shannon diversity index applied to cultural representation
```
H = -Σ(pi * ln(pi))
where pi = proportion of participants from culture i
```
**Optimal Range**: 1.8-2.3 (indicates 6-10 cultural patterns represented)

### 2. Cultural Evenness Index
**Calculation**: Shannon evenness measure
```
J = H / ln(S)
where H = diversity, S = number of cultures
```
**Optimal Range**: 0.7-1.0 (balanced representation, no cultural dominance)

### 3. Cultural Bridging Capacity
**Calculation**: Network analysis of cross-cultural connections
```
Bridging = Σ(cross_cultural_connections) / total_possible_connections
```
**Enhanced Factor**: Participants with multi-cultural backgrounds serve as bridges

### 4. Cultural Resonance Score
**Calculation**: Pairwise cultural compatibility analysis
- **Complementary Patterns**: Different but synergistic (score: 0.7-0.8)
- **Resonant Patterns**: Similar approaches (score: 0.6-0.7)
- **Bridge Patterns**: Universal connectors like Aether elements (score: 0.8-0.9)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Cultural Profile Integration
```typescript
interface CollectiveParticipant {
  // Cultural consciousness profile
  culturalProfile?: {
    primaryCulture: string;           // Main cultural pattern
    culturalBackground: string[];     // Multiple cultural exposures
    culturalAdaptability: number;     // 0-1, bridge potential
    preferredCommunicationStyle: string;
    spiritualTradition?: string;
  };
}
```

### Cultural Diversity Calculation Methods
```typescript
// Cultural variety using Shannon diversity
calculateCulturalVariety(participants: CollectiveParticipant[]): number {
  const cultureCounts = new Map<string, number>();
  participants.forEach(p => {
    const culture = p.culturalProfile?.primaryCulture;
    if (culture) {
      cultureCounts.set(culture, (cultureCounts.get(culture) || 0) + 1);
    }
  });

  const total = participants.length;
  let diversity = 0;

  cultureCounts.forEach(count => {
    const proportion = count / total;
    diversity -= proportion * Math.log(proportion);
  });

  return diversity;
}

// Cultural bridging capacity analysis
calculateCulturalBridging(participants: CollectiveParticipant[]): number {
  let bridgingConnections = 0;
  let totalPossible = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < participants.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < participants.length; j++) {
      totalPossible++;

      const culture1 = participants[i].culturalProfile?.primaryCulture;
      const culture2 = participants[j].culturalProfile?.primaryCulture;

      if (culture1 !== culture2) {
        // Cross-cultural connection potential
        const adaptability1 = participants[i].culturalProfile?.culturalAdaptability || 0;
        const adaptability2 = participants[j].culturalProfile?.culturalAdaptability || 0;

        const bridgingPotential = (adaptability1 + adaptability2) / 2;
        bridgingConnections += bridgingPotential;
      }
    }
  }

  return totalPossible > 0 ? bridgingConnections / totalPossible : 0;
}
```

### Culturally-Aware Guidance Generation
```typescript
generateCulturalGuidance(session: CollectiveConsciousnessState): string[] {
  const guidance = [];
  const diversity = this.calculateCulturalDiversity(session);

  // Phase-specific cultural guidance
  switch (session.phase) {
    case 'forming':
      if (diversity.variety > 2.0) {
        guidance.push("Rich cultural diversity detected. Begin with cultural appreciation round - invite each participant to share their cultural approach to group connection.");
      }
      break;

    case 'norming':
      if (diversity.evenness < 0.6) {
        guidance.push("Cultural imbalance detected. Encourage quieter cultural patterns to share their approaches to group agreements.");
      }
      break;

    case 'performing':
      if (diversity.bridgingCapacity > 0.7) {
        guidance.push("Strong cultural bridging detected. Leverage bridge participants to facilitate cross-cultural collaboration techniques.");
      }
      break;
  }

  return guidance;
}
```
