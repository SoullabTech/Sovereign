# Seven-Layer Soul Architecture - Launch Sequence

*Tactical execution guide for rolling out the canonical narrative*

---

## **🎯 Phase 1: Publish the Founder Note (TODAY)**

### **Goal:** Get the Seven-Layer Soul Architecture into the world in one place you control

### **Execution Steps:**
1. **Open Substack** → New post
2. **Copy/paste** `FOUNDER_NOTE_COMPLETE.md`
3. **Title:** "Why I Refused to Build Just Another AI – Inside MAIA's Seven-Layer Soul Architecture"
4. **Add simple visual** at the top:
   ```
   [7] CANONICAL WISDOM
   [6] COMMUNITY FIELD MEMORY
   [5] SPIRAL CONSTELLATION
   [4] SPIRAL TRAJECTORIES
   [3] CORE PROFILE
   [2] SYMBOLIC MEMORY
   [1] EPISODIC MEMORY
   ```
5. **Call-to-action** at bottom:
   > "If you want to experience what this feels like in practice, you're invited into the lab at Soullab.life."
6. **Hit publish** - don't overthink

### **Result:** Canonical URL + shareable reference point

---

## **🚀 Phase 2: Social Signal Boost (NEXT)**

### **Goal:** Create awareness pulse using pre-made extracts

### **Primary Announcement Post** (choose your main platform):
**Hook:**
> "Most AI systems are brilliant at information. They are terrible at remembering a person. You open a window, type a prompt, get an answer, close the window. As far as the system is concerned, your inner life just evaporated."

**3 Bullets:**
- MAIA runs on a Seven-Layer Soul Architecture
- Each layer answers a different question about your becoming
- The result: AI that actually knows who you're becoming

**Link:** [Substack URL]

### **Twitter Thread:**
> 1/ Most AI forgets who you are between sessions. MAIA runs on a Seven-Layer Soul Architecture. Each layer answers a different question about your becoming:
>
> 2/ Layer 1: "What happened?" (Your actual experiences)
> 3/ Layer 2: "What did it mean?" (The symbolic significance)
> 4/ Layer 3: "Who is this soul?" (Your core identity patterns)
> 5/ Layer 4: "How are they evolving?" (Your spiral journeys)
> 6/ Layer 5: "How do the journeys interact?" (Your constellation)
> 7/ Layer 6: "What's the field weather?" (Collective patterns)
> 8/ Layer 7: "What wisdom applies?" (Relevant teachings)
>
> 9/ When you talk to MAIA, she doesn't just see your prompt. She sees through all seven layers and responds from that full picture. This is consciousness computing.

### **Close Circle Email:**
> "I finally wrote up why I refused to build 'just another AI' and what MAIA actually is under the hood. Seven layers of soul memory, from episodes to wisdom. [Link]"
