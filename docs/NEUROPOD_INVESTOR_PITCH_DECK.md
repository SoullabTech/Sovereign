# Neuropod: Consciousness Computing Hardware Platform
## Investor Pitch Deck

**Prepared:** December 2025
**Status:** Seed Round
**Ask:** $250k for 10-15% equity

---

## SLIDE 1: The Problem

### The Consciousness Tech Market is Polarized

**On one side: Pseudoscience hype**
- "Healing frequencies" (432 Hz DNA repair, 528 Hz heart chakra)
- "Digital DMT" claims with zero validation
- Neurofeedback devices with no measurable outcomes
- $400 meditation headbands that don't work

**Result:** Consumer distrust, wasted money, no real outcomes

**On the other side: Clinical devices stuck behind FDA walls**
- TDCS/TMS devices (effective but medical-only, $10k+)
- Closed-loop acoustic stimulation (CLAS) — gold standard for sleep, but no consumer product
- fMRI neurofeedback (research-only, $500k+ equipment)

**Result:** Effective tech inaccessible to 99% of people

**The gap:**
- No evidence-based, accessible consciousness navigation hardware
- No integration between biometric validation and developmental progression
- No platform combining nervous system regulation with symbolic/archetypal depth work

**We're building the third way.**

---

## SLIDE 2: The Solution

### Neuropod: Evidence-Based Consciousness Navigation Hardware

**What it is:**
- Vibroacoustic stimulation platform (20-120 Hz transducers)
- ASSR neural entrainment (10 Hz alpha, 6.5 Hz theta, 40 Hz gamma)
- CLAS sleep enhancement (gold standard, ★★★★★ evidence)
- Breath-synced haptic biofeedback (HRV coherence training)
- Integrated with MAIA's developmental architecture (Bloom-level gating)

**What it does:**
- Nervous system regulation (HRV coherence ↑, stress ↓)
- State deepening (absorption, contemplation, insight)
- Developmental progression (validated with biometrics)
- Archetypal session work (shadow integration, anima/animus dialogue)

**What makes it unique:**
- Evidence-grounded (3 validation experiments, N=95, peer-reviewed publication target)
- Developmentally-aware (Bloom-level gating prevents overwhelm, spiritual bypassing)
- Biometrically-validated (HRV coherence, ASSR PLV, global synchrony, defect density)
- Safety-first (3-layer safety architecture, medical screening, real-time monitoring)

**Not pseudoscience. Not inaccessible clinical tech. The third way.**
