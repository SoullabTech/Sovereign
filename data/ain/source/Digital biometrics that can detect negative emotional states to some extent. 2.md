Digital biometrics that can detect negative emotional states to some extent. 

  

Several methods have been explored in research and development to analyze physiological and behavioral markers associated with emotions. Here are a few examples:

  

    Facial Expression Analysis: Facial recognition technology can detect and analyze facial expressions to infer emotional states. It uses computer vision algorithms to identify patterns in facial features such as eyebrow movement, eye widening, and lip curvature, which can indicate emotions like anger, sadness, or disgust.

  

    Voice Analysis: By analyzing vocal features such as pitch, tone, intensity, and speech rate, it's possible to infer emotional states. Certain patterns in voice can indicate stress, anger, sadness, or excitement. Machine learning algorithms can be employed to classify emotional states based on these vocal cues.

  

    Galvanic Skin Response (GSR): GSR measures the electrical conductivity of the skin, which can change with emotional arousal. An increase in sweat gland activity, often caused by stress or anxiety, can be an indicator of negative emotional states. Wearable devices or sensors can capture GSR data for analysis.

  

    Heart Rate Variability (HRV): HRV is the variation in time intervals between successive heartbeats. It is influenced by the autonomic nervous system, which is associated with emotional responses. Negative emotional states like anger or fear can lead to decreased HRV, while positive emotions can result in increased HRV. Wearable devices with heart rate monitors can capture this data.

  

    Keystroke Dynamics: The way people type or use keyboards can provide insights into their emotional states. Variations in typing speed, rhythm, or pressure can indicate stress, frustration, or other negative emotions. Analyzing keystroke dynamics can be used as an indirect measure of emotional states.

  

It's important to note that while these biometric measures can provide indications of emotional states, they are not foolproof and may not be entirely accurate or universally applicable. Emotions are complex, and individual differences can affect the interpretation of these biometrics. Moreover, emotional states can also be influenced by other factors such as context and personal experiences. Current research aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of these techniques, but they are still evolving areas of study.
