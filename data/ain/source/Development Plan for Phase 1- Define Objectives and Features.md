### Development Plan for Phase 1: Define Objectives and Features

#### **1. Emotion Tracking and Recognition**

##### **Tools and Features:**

- **Emotion Journal:**
    - A real-time logging tool where users can input their current emotional state.
    - Drop-down menu with predefined emotions (e.g., anger, joy, sadness, fear, surprise).
    - Option for free-text input to allow more nuanced expressions.
- **Emotion Detection Patterns:**
    - Incorporate NLP for analyzing free-text inputs to recognize emotion-related keywords and context.
    - Utilize pattern recognition algorithms to identify trends over time (e.g., repeated stress in specific contexts like work or relationships).

##### **Additional Features:**

- **Contextual Tagging:**
    - Allow users to tag emotions with contexts such as “work,” “home,” or “social interactions.”
- **Trigger Identification:**
    - Prompt users to describe events or thoughts that led to their emotional state.
    - Highlight recurring triggers and their emotional impacts.

##### **Outputs:**

- **Daily Emotion Insights:**
    - Summary of emotions logged during the day with frequency and intensity.
- **Weekly Patterns:**
    - Charts showing trends, dominant emotions, and contexts.
- **Trigger Maps:**
    - Visualizations connecting triggers with recurring emotions.

#### **2. Basic EI Assessment and Feedback**

##### **Assessment Domains:**

1. **Self-Awareness:**
    - Ability to recognize one’s emotions and their effects.
    - Example Question: “I am able to name the emotions I feel in most situations.”
2. **Self-Regulation:**
    - Ability to control impulsive emotions and behaviors.
    - Example Question: “I can stay calm in stressful situations.”
3. **Motivation:**
    - Drive to achieve goals and remain optimistic despite challenges.
    - Example Question: “I stay motivated even after setbacks.”
4. **Empathy:**
    - Ability to understand and share the feelings of others.
    - Example Question: “I find it easy to understand how others are feeling.”
5. **Social Skills:**
    - Effectiveness in managing relationships and building networks.
    - Example Question: “I communicate clearly and effectively in group settings.”

##### **Assessment Features:**

- **Scoring System:**
    - Weighted scoring based on responses to a Likert scale (e.g., “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”).
- **Dynamic Feedback:**
    - Offer personalized insights (e.g., “You excel in empathy but could improve in self-regulation”).

##### **Outputs:**

- **Visual Dashboard:**
    - Spider chart or bar graph displaying EI scores across the five domains.
- **Actionable Feedback:**
    - Targeted suggestions for improvement in low-scoring areas.

#### **3. Regulation Techniques and Exercises**

##### **Techniques:**

1. **Mindfulness:**
    - Breathing exercises to calm the mind and reduce emotional reactivity.
    - Example: Guided “5-5-5 Breath” (inhale for 5 seconds, hold for 5 seconds, exhale for 5 seconds).
2. **Grounding:**
    - Techniques to focus on the present moment.
    - Example: “5-4-3-2-1 Technique” (identify five things you can see, four you can touch, etc.).
3. **Reframing:**
    - Exercises to challenge and replace negative thought patterns.
    - Example: Journaling prompts like, “What’s a positive perspective I can take on this situation?”

##### **Dynamic Features:**

- **Personalized Recommendations:**
    - Tailor exercises based on user inputs (e.g., stress levels, emotion triggers).
- **Progress Tracking:**
    - Track usage and effectiveness of techniques over time.

##### **Outputs:**

- **Daily Emotional Regulation Log:**
    - Users rate the effectiveness of techniques (e.g., “Breathing exercise helped reduce my stress by 50%”).
- **Progress Reports:**
    - Monthly summary showing improvement in self-regulation and emotional balance.

### **Implementation Strategy**

#### **Step 1: Emotion Tracking and Recognition**

- Build a prototype for emotion logging (predefined options + free-text inputs).
- Develop basic algorithms for trigger identification and emotional trends.
- Create a simple visualization tool for emotion patterns.

#### **Step 2: EI Assessment**

- Draft and finalize the self-assessment questionnaire.
- Implement scoring algorithms and create a feedback system.
- Design a dashboard for displaying results.

#### **Step 3: Regulation Techniques**

- Develop guided exercises and integrate dynamic recommendations.
- Add progress-tracking functionality.

### **Next Steps**

Let’s decide whether to:

1. Start with **Emotion Tracking and Recognition** (easiest entry point).
2. Move to the **EI Assessment** (provides foundational insights).
3. Begin with **Regulation Techniques** (most actionable for immediate impact).

Which focus feels most aligned for starting development? Or should we build the modules in parallel?
