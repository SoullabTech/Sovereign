  # Albedo: The Whitening

  

  ## Essence

  

  The stage of clarification, purification, and insight that follows the

  darkness of nigredo; psychologically, moments of understanding,

  theoretical clarity, and illumination - with attendant risks of inflation.

  

  ## Description

  

  The albedo (from Latin "whitening") is the second major stage of the

  alchemical process. After the blackening and decomposition of nigredo,

  there comes a washing, purifying, clarifying stage. What was dark and

  confused becomes lighter and clearer. In psychological terms, this

  manifests as insight, understanding, theoretical comprehension, moments of

   clarity about oneself and one's process.

  

  This is the stage of:

  - Seeing patterns clearly

  - Understanding the meaning of what happened in the darkness

  - Gaining perspective and distance

  - Theoretical comprehension

  - "Aha!" moments

  - Washing away confusion

  - Separating and distinguishing

  

  It feels like relief after the darkness - light breaking through, fog

  lifting, confusion clearing. The albedo brings a kind of brightness and

  clarity that can be genuinely helpful and healing.

  

  ****However, there's a crucial danger:**** identifying with the light,

  believing "I am enlightened," confusing theoretical understanding with

  embodied realization. As Marlan discusses, some alchemists stopped at

  albedo, thinking they'd achieved the goal. But without the yellowing

  (citrinitas) and full embodiment (rubedo), the albedo can become a

  spiritual bypass - staying in the realm of pure understanding while

  avoiding the messiness of actual life.

  

  As Edinger notes, many people in analysis have powerful albedo experiences

   - dreams of white light, spiritual visions, profound insights. These are

  genuine and valuable. But if they become inflated, if the person thinks

  they've "arrived," the work stops prematurely.

  

  ## Alchemical Context

  

  In the alchemical texts, the albedo is depicted as:

  - Washing, baptism, purification

  - The white queen

  - Silver (luna, the moon)

  - White dove

  - White rose

  - Swan

  - Morning star

  - Lactation (white milk)

  - Whitening of the blackened matter

  

  The texts emphasize this comes _*after*_ the nigredo - you cannot skip the

  darkness to get to the light. And most importantly, the albedo is not the

  final stage. The work must continue.

  

  Some alchemists considered albedo the "lesser work" (opus minor) while

  rubedo was the "greater work" (opus major).

  ****Traditional alchemical:****

  - White queen (in contrast to red king)

  - Silver/moon

  - White dove descending

  - Washing/baptism

  - Swan

  - White lily or rose

  - Bride in white

  

  ****Mythological/Religious:****

  - Dawn breaking

  - Easter (after the crucifixion darkness)

  - Transfiguration

  - White goddess figures (Sophia, White Tara)

  

  ****Psychological:****

  - The light bulb moment

  - Fog lifting

  - Seeing clearly for the first time

  - Understanding dawning

  

  ## In Practice

  

  ### Clinical/Therapeutic

  

  ****Recognizing albedo experiences:****

  

  Clients often have these moments:

  - "Oh my God, I finally understand why I..."

  - "It's all so clear now..."

  - "I see the pattern..."

  - Dreams of white light, clarity, elevation

  - Feeling of burden lifted

  - New theoretical understanding

  

  ****These are real and valuable.**** Honor them. But watch for inflation:

  

  ****Signs of healthy albedo:****

  - Insight accompanied by humility

  - Understanding that more work remains

  - Connection to both shadow and light

  - Embodied as well as mental understanding

  - Not dismissive of the nigredo that preceded it

  

  ****Signs of inflation (unhealthy albedo):****

  - "I've transcended my problems"

  - "I'm beyond all that now"

  - Looking down on others who "don't get it"

  - Loss of humor, especially about self

  - Brittleness (can't tolerate complexity)

  - All light, no shadow

  - Purely mental, not embodied

  

  ****Therapeutic response to inflation:****

  - Don't pop the bubble aggressively

  - Gently introduce shadow of the insight

  - Ask about the body ("Where do you feel this understanding?")

  - Invite cynicism: "What might be problematic about this realization?"

  - Wait for psyche to bring yellowing naturally

  - Share myths of inflation (Icarus, Phaethon)

  

  ### Personal Work

  

  ****When in albedo:****

  

  ****Appreciate it:****

  - These moments are gifts

  - Clarity is valuable

  - Understanding helps

  - Relief is real

  

  ****But stay grounded:****

  - "This is _*a*_ moment of clarity, not _*the*_ final truth"

  - Keep humor and self-deprecation

  - Stay connected to body

  - Remember the darkness

  - Don't dismiss others' struggles

  - Know more work remains

  

  ****Questions to ask:****

  - What's the shadow of this insight?

  - What am I not seeing?

  - How is my body experiencing this (not just my mind)?

  - What would a cynic say about this realization?

  - What would bring this understanding back down to earth?

  

  ****Physical practices:****

  - Stay in body (exercise, yoga, dance)

  - Sexual embodiment (if appropriate)

  - Earth contact (gardening, hiking)

  - Anything that keeps you grounded

  

  ### Creative Practice

  

  ****Albedo in art:****

  - Can be expressed through white, silver, clarity

  - But be wary of only creating "light" work

  - Include complexity even in clear moments

  - Don't make everything "inspirational"

  

  ## Questions for Reflection

  

  1. When have I had moments of sudden clarity or insight?

  2. Have I ever confused understanding something with having integrated it?

  3. Where might I be inflated right now - identified with light while

  denying shadow?

  4. What's the difference between genuine insight and spiritual bypass?

  5. How do I stay grounded when experiencing clarity?

  6. What insights have I had that stayed purely theoretical rather than

  becoming embodied?

  

  ## Voices

  

  > "A lot of the Alchemists stopped with the Albedo and Edinger stops with

  that too - he sees it as the goal. But then Jim [Hillman] goes on and says

   that whiteness has to be yellowed..." — Stanton Marlan

  

  > "The albedo is a stage of reflection, of seeing, of insight. But it is

  not yet embodiment." — Edward Edinger

  

  > "We are blinded by the light as much as by the darkness." — Carl Jung

  ## Cautions & Misunderstandings

  

  ❌ ****Not:**** The final goal

  ❌ ****Not:**** Better than other stages

  ❌ ****Not:**** Only positive/desirable

  ❌ ****Not:**** "Enlightenment" in permanent sense

  ❌ ****Not:**** Purely mental with no body

  

  ✓ ****Is:**** A necessary stage

  ✓ ****Is:**** Genuine insight and clarity

  ✓ ****Is:**** Relief after darkness

  ✓ ****Is:**** Understanding that needs further work

  ✓ ****Is:**** Preparation for yellowing and rubedo

  

  ****The innocence problem:****

  

  Hillman distinguishes between:

  - ****Innocent whiteness:**** Never been tested, naive, untouched by darkness

  - ****Albedo whiteness:**** Earned through nigredo, clarified through

  suffering

  

  The first is immature. The second is valuable but must be yellowed.

  

  ****Warning signs:****

  - Everything feels "light" and "clear" for extended time

  - No shadow, no doubt, no complexity

  - Dismissiveness toward darkness

  - Only reading/consuming "positive" content

  - Loss of groundedness

  - Inflation (subtle or obvious)

  # Soul vs Spirit: Hillman's Core Distinction

  

  ## Essence

  

  A foundational distinction in archetypal psychology: Spirit moves upward

  toward transcendence, unity, and light; Soul moves downward toward depth,

  multiplicity, and embodied imagination.

  

  ## Description

  

  James Hillman's distinction between ****soul**** and ****spirit**** is one of his

  most important and most misunderstood contributions. It's not that one is

  "good" and the other "bad" - both are necessary. But in Western culture

  (and in much psychology and spirituality), spirit has dominated, and soul

  has been neglected or misunderstood.

  

  ### Spirit

  

  ****Direction:**** Upward, outward, transcendent

  ****Qualities:**** Unity, light, abstraction, clarity, transcendence, peak

  experiences, oneness

  ****Desires:**** To escape the body, rise above, achieve enlightenment, unify,

   purify

  ****Language:**** Abstract concepts, universal principles, ultimate truths

  ****Danger:**** Spiritual bypass, inflation, disconnection from body and world

  

  ****Examples:****

  - Meditation that seeks to transcend the body

  - "We are all one"

  - Peak experiences on mountaintops

  - Enlightenment fantasies

  - Abstract philosophical systems

  - The eternal, unchanging, perfect

  

  ### Soul

  

  ****Direction:**** Downward, inward, immanent

  ****Qualities:**** Multiplicity, darkness, imagination, complexity,

  embodiment, depth, pathology

  ****Desires:**** To go deeper into experience, engage the mess of life, honor

  multiplicity

  ****Language:**** Images, metaphors, stories, the specific and particular

  ****Danger:**** Getting stuck in pathology, losing aspiration, wallowing

  

  ****Examples:****

  - Working with dreams and their dark imagery

  - "Things are complicated, multiple, paradoxical"

  - Descent experiences in valleys and depths

  - Honoring symptoms and pathology

  - Specific, textured stories

  - The temporal, changing, imperfect

  

  ### The Relationship

  

  As Marlan describes it:

  

  > "This whole idea of this world and other world of spirit which is

  physical or metaphysical... where soul is more the imaginario and Hillman

  emphasizes the importance of the imagination that breaks with the

  traditions of literalizing."

  

  ****Soul is the middle realm**** - the mundus imaginalis (imaginal world)

  between pure spirit (transcendent) and pure matter (literal). It's the

  realm of:

  - Images and imagination

  - Myth and story

  - Dream and reverie

  - Psyche itself

  

  Hillman isn't saying reject spirit entirely, but he's making a corrective

  emphasis: Western culture has been ****too spiritual**** and ****not soulful** 

  **enough****. We need to come back down.

  

  ## Alchemical Context

  

  This maps onto the alchemical color sequence:

  

  ****Spirit's movement:****

  - Nigredo → Albedo (escaping the darkness into light)

  - Sublimatio (rising, purifying, going up)

  - White (albedo) as goal

  

  ****Soul's movement:****

  - Albedo → Citrinitas (yellowing the white, bringing it back down)

  - Staying with nigredo rather than fleeing it

  - Red (rubedo) as embodied goal

  

  ****The yellowing is soul's correction to spirit:**** bringing the elevated

  understanding back into body, earth, bitterness, life.

  ## In Practice

  

  ### Clinical/Therapeutic

  

  ****Recognizing when clients are "too spiritual":****

  - All language is elevated, abstract

  - Disconnection from body

  - "I've transcended my anger/sadness/fear"

  - Only wants to talk about insights, not feelings

  - Meditation/spirituality as escape from life

  - Everything is "all one" or "meant to be"

  

  ****Soul-centered interventions:****

  - "What does your body feel?"

  - "Tell me the specific story, not the lesson"

  - "What if that anger has something to teach?"

  - Work with dreams (especially dark ones)

  - Honor symptoms rather than just trying to eliminate them

  - Bring abstractions to images

  

  ****Recognizing when clients are "too soulful":****

  - Stuck in pathology with no movement

  - Can't see any larger patterns or meaning

  - Wallowing in the particular

  - No aspiration or vision

  - Too caught in the literal

  

  ****Spirit-centered interventions:****

  - "What's the larger pattern here?"

  - "What are you being called toward?"

  - "Can we gain some perspective?"

  

  ****The goal:**** Both/and, not either/or. But in our culture, the emphasis

  usually needs to be on returning to soul.

  

  ### Personal Work

  

  ****Questions to ask:****

  

  ****Am I too spirit-oriented?****

  - Do I meditate to escape my life?

  - Is my spirituality disconnected from my body?

  - Do I use "oneness" language to avoid dealing with conflicts?

  - Am I always trying to rise above rather than go into?

  - Is everything abstract rather than specific?

  

  ****Am I too soul-oriented?****

  - Am I stuck in my pathology?

  - Do I have no aspiration or vision?

  - Is everything heavy and dark with no light?

  - Am I wallowing rather than transforming?

  

  ****Soul practices:****

  - Dreamwork (especially staying with dark dreams)

  - Active imagination

  - Working with the body

  - Engaging with art, myth, story

  - Honoring symptoms and pathology

  - Staying with the image

  - Descent practices

  

  ****Spirit practices:****

  - Meditation and contemplation

  - Prayer and devotion

  - Seeking higher perspectives

  - Studying philosophy and wisdom

  - Aspiring toward ideals

  

  ### In Community/Culture

  

  ****Spirit-dominated culture:****

  - Self-help that's all about "positivity"

  - Spirituality as escape from world

  - "Good vibes only"

  - Toxic positivity

  - Transcendence without embodiment

  - Unity without honoring difference

  

  ****Soul-centered corrective:****

  - Honor the dark as well as light

  - Work with pathology, not just against it

  - Multiplicity over unity

  - Descent as well as ascent

  - Embodiment and earth-connection

  - Imagination over literalism

  

  ## Questions for Reflection

  

  1. In my life, am I more oriented toward spirit or soul?

  2. What would it mean to "come back down" if I'm too elevated?

  3. How do I use spirituality? To engage life more deeply, or escape it?

  4. What symptoms/pathologies might actually be soul speaking?

  5. Where do I need ascent/aspiration? Where do I need descent/depth?

  6. How do I honor both without collapsing into either/or?

  

  ## Voices

  physical or metaphysical where soul is more the imaginario and Hillman

  emphasizes the importance of the imagination that breaks with the

  traditions of literalizing." — Stanton Marlan

  

  > "We need to de-spiritualize psychology and re-animate it with soul." —

  James Hillman (paraphrased)

  

  > "The cure of the shadow is not in the light but in a homeopathic

  darkness." — James Hillman

  

  > "We've had two thousand years of spirit. It's time for soul." — James

  Hillman (paraphrased)

  

  ## Cautions & Misunderstandings

  

  ❌ ****Not:**** Spirit is bad, soul is good

  ❌ ****Not:**** Never meditate or seek transcendence

  ❌ ****Not:**** Stay stuck in pathology forever

  ❌ ****Not:**** Reject all aspiration

  ❌ ****Not:**** Anti-spiritual

  

  ✓ ****Is:**** A corrective emphasis for Western culture

  ✓ ****Is:**** Both are needed

  ✓ ****Is:**** Soul has been neglected

  ✓ ****Is:**** Depth rather than height as primary

  ✓ ****Is:**** Imagination over literalism

  

  ****Common confusion:****

  

  People sometimes think Hillman is anti-spiritual or anti-meditation. He's

  not. He's saying:

  1. Spirit has dominated; soul needs emphasis

  2. Spirituality can be soul-ful (embodied, imaginal) or spirit-ual

  (transcendent, abstract)

  3. Psychology should be about soul (psyche), not spirit

  

  ****Watch out for:****

  - Using this as excuse to never aspire

  - Making soul another concept to grasp

  - Creating a new either/or (when it's both/and)

  - Dismissing all spiritual practice

  # Rubedo: The Reddening

  

  ## Essence

  

  The final stage of the alchemical process; the full embodiment, the red

  tincture, the philosopher's stone - characterized by life force, blood,

  full incarnation, and the marriage of all opposites in lived reality.

  

  ## Description

  

  The rubedo (from Latin "reddening") is the culmination of the alchemical

  work - the goal toward which nigredo, albedo, and citrinitas have been

  leading. After the decomposition of nigredo, the clarification of albedo,

  and the embodying yellowing of citrinitas, comes the rubedo: full

  incarnation, full embodiment, the philosopher's stone.

  

  This is the stage of:

  - Full life force

  - Blood (not just theory or insight, but lived reality)

  - Embodied realization (not just understanding)

  - The red king (solar force made manifest)

  - The red tincture that transforms base metals to gold

  - Heat, passion, fire

  - Full presence in the body and world

  - Integration that is lived, not just known

  

  The rubedo is sometimes called the ****opus major**** (greater work) in

  contrast to albedo as ****opus minor**** (lesser work). This is because it's

  not enough to understand or see clearly - the work must be _*embodied*_,

  _*lived*_, _*incarnated*_ in actual life.

  

  As Marlan describes it:

  

  > "That yellowing experience there's a turning and an embodiment of a

  reddening or the rubedo that leads to the depths of the powerful quality

  of the imaginal reality."

  

  The rubedo is:

  - Not transcendence, but full immanence

  - Not escape from the body, but full embrace of it

  - Not abstract understanding, but lived wisdom

  - Not "spiritual" elevation, but soulful depth made manifest

  

  ## Alchemical Context

  

  In the alchemical texts, the rubedo is depicted as:

  - The red king (in union with white queen)

  - Gold (but incarnated gold, not abstract)

  - The sun at full power (not distant celestial sun, but sun in the world)

  - Blood, life force, red wine

  - The phoenix rising from ashes

  - The philosopher's stone (lapis philosophorum)

  - Ruby, red rose

  - Fire (sustained, not destructive)

  

  ****The complete sequence:****

  1. ****Nigredo**** (black) - decomposition, descent, shadow work

  2. ****Albedo**** (white) - clarification, insight, purification

  3. ****Citrinitas**** (yellow) - embodiment begins, yellowing of whiteness

  4. ****Rubedo**** (red) - full embodiment, integration, life force

  

  Some texts skip citrinitas and go: Nigredo → Albedo → Rubedo. But Hillman

  emphasizes the yellowing as crucial to reaching a genuine (not inflated)

  rubedo.

  

  ****Key point:**** You can't skip stages. You can't jump from nigredo to

  rubedo. The work must progress through the stages, each one transforming

  what came before.

  ****Traditional alchemical:****

  - Red king (often in union with white queen)

  - Phoenix

  - Red rose

  - Ruby

  - Gold (but embodied, incarnate)

  - Red wine/blood

  - Sun (but earthly sun, not transcendent)

  - Fire that doesn't consume

  

  ****Mythological/Religious:****

  - Pentecost (tongues of fire)

  - Christ's blood (incarnation)

  - Prometheus bringing fire to earth

  - Red goddesses (Kali in red aspects, Parvati)

  

  ****Psychological:****

  - Full aliveness

  - Passionate engagement with life

  - No longer divided

  - Theory become practice

  - Understanding become embodiment

  

  ## In Practice

  

  ### Clinical/Therapeutic

  

  ****Recognizing movement toward rubedo:****

  

  When clients:

  - Embody insights (not just understand them)

  - Bring energy and passion to life

  - Engage conflicts rather than transcending them

  - Show up fully in relationships

  - Have integrated shadow (not just aware of it)

  - Live with paradox (not just think about it)

  - Demonstrate sustained change (not just peak experiences)

  

  ****This is not:****

  - Constant happiness

  - No problems

  - Perfect integration

  - Final arrival

  

  ****This is:****

  - Capacity to be fully present

  - Sustained engagement with life

  - Embodied wisdom

  - Creative fire that serves

  - Blood and bone reality, not just mental clarity

  

  ****Therapeutic goals oriented toward rubedo:****

  - Help clients not just understand but embody

  - Support not just insight but integration

  - Encourage not just seeing patterns but changing behavior

  - Facilitate not just white-light experiences but red-blood engagement

  

  ### Personal Work

  

  ****Signs you might be touching rubedo:****

  - Insights from therapy/inner work showing up in actual life changes

  - Sustained energy and engagement (not manic, but alive)

  - Less division between "spiritual self" and "regular self"

  - Comfortable in your body

  - Passionate about work/relationships/life

  - Can hold complexity without collapsing

  - Shadow integrated enough to not constantly sabotage

  - Creative fire available and sustained

  

  ****But remember:****

  - This isn't permanent achievement

  - You'll cycle through stages repeatedly

  - Rubedo in one area doesn't mean rubedo in all

  - It's more like moments/periods of full aliveness than a state you arrive

   at forever

  

  ****Questions:****

  - Where in my life am I most embodied?

  - What would full engagement look like here?

  - What's the difference between understanding something and living it?

  - Where is my life force flowing? Where blocked?

  - What needs more heat, more passion, more blood?

  

  ****Practices:****

  - Anything that brings you fully into body

  - Sexual embodiment (appropriate context)

  - Creative work you're passionate about

  - Physical challenge that requires full presence

  - Relationships that demand your full self

  - Work that calls forth your fire

  

  ### Creative Practice

  

  ****Rubedo in art:****

  - Work that's not just beautiful but alive

  - Creation that comes from blood and guts, not just ideas

  - Art that transforms (not just represents)

  - The red that emerges after working through black, white, yellow

  - Passion fully expressed

  - Fire that illuminates and transforms

  

  ## Questions for Reflection

  

  1. Where in my life am I most fully embodied and alive?

  2. What's the difference between understanding something and living it?

  3. Where do I have insights that haven't become embodied yet?

  4. What would it mean to bring more "blood" to my spiritual practice?

  5. Am I trying to skip stages to get to rubedo prematurely?

  6. What does full engagement (not perfection) look like in my life?

  ****The inflation trap:****

  

  People can claim "I've achieved the rubedo" as another form of inflation.

  True rubedo is:

  - Humble (you've been through the nigredo)

  - Embodied (not just a claim)

  - Evident in how you live

  - Not something you announce

  - Accompanied by humor

  

  ****Can't skip stages:****

  

  You can't:

  - Jump from nigredo to rubedo (skips necessary clarification)

  - Stay in albedo thinking you're in rubedo (all light, no embodiment)

  - Force rubedo through effort

  

  The work progresses naturally when given time and attention.

  # Welcome to the Alchemy & Psychology Commons

  

  _*A living library for depth work with alchemical images and psychological_ 

  _transformation*_

  

  ---

  

  ## What Is This Place?

  

  This is a ****community commons**** - a shared space for exploring the rich

  territory where alchemy meets psychology. Here you'll find:

  

  - ****Curated concepts**** from Jung, Hillman, Marlan, Edinger, and others

  - ****Thematic essays**** synthesizing key ideas

  - ****Voices and dialogues**** from depth practitioners

  - ****Practices**** for working with alchemical processes

  - ****Images**** from the alchemical tradition

  - ****Community contributions**** - your experiences, questions, insights

  

  This isn't a static encyclopedia. It's a ****living library**** that grows

  through both careful curation and community participation.

  

  ---

  

  ## Why Alchemy & Psychology?

  

  Carl Jung discovered that medieval alchemical texts, which seemed to be

  about transforming lead into gold, were actually describing psychological

  transformation processes. The alchemists were unknowingly projecting the

  individuation process onto their work with substances.

  

  This gave psychology a rich symbolic library:

  - ****Nigredo**** (blackening) - depression, descent, shadow work

  - ****Albedo**** (whitening) - clarity, insight, purification

  - ****Citrinitas**** (yellowing) - embodiment, bringing insights to earth

  - ****Rubedo**** (reddening) - full integration, life force, incarnation

  

  And operations like:

  - ****Coniunctio**** (union of opposites)

  - ****Mortificatio**** (death and release)

  - ****Calcinatio**** (burning away)

  - And many more...

  

  These aren't just interesting ideas - they're ****maps for transformation****

  that people have found useful for navigating their own psychological and

  spiritual journeys.

  

  James Hillman developed this further through ****archetypal psychology****,

  emphasizing:

  - Working with images rather than concepts

  - Soul over spirit (depth over transcendence)

  - Staying with the image

  - Honoring pathology as soul-speech

  - Against literalization

  

  Stanton Marlan and others continue this work, exploring the depths of

  alchemical psychology in contemporary practice.

  ## Core Principles

  

  This library is built on several foundational principles:

  

  ### 1. Stick with the Image

  

  Don't rush to interpret or decode. Stay with alchemical and psychological

  images. Let them remain strange and alive. The strangeness protects

  against premature literalization.

  

  ### 2. Honor Depth

  

  This isn't self-help or quick fixes. Depth work takes time. Transformation

   can't be rushed. We're here for the long work.

  

  ### 3. Multiple Perspectives

  

  Jung, Hillman, Edinger, and others sometimes disagree. We hold multiple

  perspectives rather than claiming one "right" view. The tension between

  perspectives can be generative.

  

  ### 4. Both/And

  

  Resist either/or thinking. Hold opposites in tension. The coniunctio

  (union of opposites) produces something new that transcends both poles.

  

  ### 5. Community Wisdom

  

  No one person has all the insight. Your experiences, questions, and

  practices enrich the commons. We build this together.

  

  ### 6. Against Literalization

  

  Concepts and images are alive, metaphoric, multiple. We resist reducing

  them to fixed, literal meanings. This includes resisting turning this work

   itself into dogma.

  ### Don't Rush

  

  This material is dense. One concept card might deserve a week of

  reflection. Take your time.

  

  ### Return & Revisit

  

  Your understanding will deepen with rereading. Come back to entries after

  time has passed.

  

  ### Follow Energy

  

  If something excites or disturbs you, that's probably where you need to

  go.

  

  ### Make Notes

  

  Use your own journal/vault to respond to what you read. This isn't just

  passive consumption.

  

  ### Contribute

  

  Your perspective matters. Share what you're learning, questioning,

  discovering.

  

  ### Hold Lightly

  

  Don't literalize this material into dogma. It's alive, multiple,

  paradoxical. Stay fluid.

  _"The black dog in your dream is obviously your shadow"_

  _"X always means Y"_

  _"This is just about..."_

  

  **_**Why:**_** _Kills the image. Literalizes the work. Presumes to know._

  

  **_**Instead:**_** _"I'm curious about the black dog..." / "In my experience,_ 

  black dogs have..." / "What's your relationship to that dog?"

  

  _---_

  

  _### ✗ Spiritual Bypassing_

  

  _Using concepts to avoid real problems:_

  _- "It's just my nigredo" (instead of addressing abuse)_

  _- "It's all meant to be" (instead of taking responsibility)_

  _- "I've transcended that" (instead of actually dealing with it)_

  

  **_**Why:**_** _This work can be misused to avoid necessary action._

  

  **_**Instead:**_** _Both/and - honor the soul process AND take appropriate_ 

  action.

  

  _---_

  

  _### ✗ Guru-Making_

  

  _Treating Jung, Hillman, or anyone as infallible:_

  _- "Hillman said it, so it must be true"_

  _- "We can't question Jung"_

  _- "Only experts can understand this"_

  

  **_**Why:**_** _Even our teachers were/are human and limited. Blind devotion_ 

  kills inquiry.

  

  **_**Instead:**_** _Respect AND critique. Learn from AND question._

  

  _---_

  

  _### ✗ Appropriation_

  

  _Taking from closed traditions without permission/understanding:_

  _- Using Native American ceremonies_

  _- Claiming shamanic initiations you haven't earned_

  _- Borrowing from living traditions without respect_

  

  **_**Why:**_** _Some things aren't ours to take. Honor matters._

  

  **_**Instead:**_** _Learn from open teachings. Acknowledge sources. Stay humble_ 

  about what you don't know.

  

  _---_

  

  _### ✗ Jargon-Dumping_

  

  _Using insider language without explanation:_

  _- "This is clearly an enantiodromia of the anima into the ­puer aspect"_

  _- Technical terms without context_

  _- Performance of sophistication_

  

  **_**Why:**_** _Makes the work inaccessible. Serves ego, not community._

  

  **_**Instead:**_** _Explain terms. Use accessible language. Serve the work, not_ 

  your image.

  

  _---_

  

  _### ✗ Personal Attacks_

  

  _- Attacking other members_

  _- Shaming or belittling_

  _- Mockery or sarcasm as weapon_

  _- Ad hominem arguments_

  

  **_**Why:**_** _Creates unsafe space. Shuts down exploration._

  

  **_**Instead:**_** _Critique ideas, not people. Disagree respectfully. Assume_ 

  good faith.

  

  _---_

  ## Curation Process

  ### Review (Within 1-2 Weeks)

  

  Curation team reviews for:

  - Appropriateness for commons

  - Privacy/safety concerns

  - Alignment with community values

  - Quality and clarity

  

  ### Three Outcomes

  

  ****1. Publish As-Is****

  - Contribution is ready

  - Gets posted to appropriate section

  - You're notified and thanked

  

  ****2. Develop Together****

  - Good content but needs work

  - We reach out to collaborate

  - Refine together

  - Then publish

  

  ****3. Private Response****

  - Not right fit for commons

  - We explain why (privately, kindly)

  - Might suggest alternatives

  - Nothing is published without your consent

  

  ### Integration

  

  Your contribution might:

  - Stand alone as its own entry

  - Get added to existing entry

  - Inspire new curated content

  - Seed future development

  

  ****You'll always be credited**** (if you want to be).

  ## Style Guidelines

  

  ### Voice & Tone

  

  ****✓ Do:****

  - Write naturally, as yourself

  - Use "I" and personal voice

  - Be specific and concrete

  - Include uncertainty and questions

  - Show your humanity

  

  ****✗ Avoid:****

  - Academic jargon (unless explained)

  - Pretending to know more than you do

  - Overly formal or stuffy

  - Performative spirituality

  - Self-help cheeriness

  

  ### Practical Tips

  

  ****Be specific:****

  - Not: "I had a synchronicity"

  - But: "I was thinking about yellowing and found a yellow book titled

  'Down to Earth' at a thrift store"

  

  ****Stay with images:****

  - Not: "The shadow appeared"

  - But: "A black dog followed me through narrow streets"

  

  ****Ask, don't tell:****

  - Not: "This obviously means..."

  - But: "I'm wondering if..."

  

  ****Show don't just tell:****

  - Include the dream, not just your interpretation

  - Share the practice steps, not just that it "works"

  - Give the story, not just the lesson

  

  ### Length

  

  ****No strict limits****, but:

  - Personal experiences: 300-800 words usually

  - Questions: Be concise but provide context

  - Practices: Enough detail to actually do it

  - Creative work: Let it be what it is

  

  ****If over 1500 words****, consider if it might be an essay rather than a

  contribution.

  ## Final Thoughts

  

  ### This Is Your Commons Too

  

  Not just a resource to consume.

  A space you help create.

  Your voice matters.

  Your experience counts.

  Your questions open doors.

  

  ### Trust the Process

  

  Not every contribution will be published exactly as submitted.

  That's okay.

  We're in this together.

  The curation helps maintain quality and coherence.

  But your perspective will be honored.

  

  ### Start Small

  

  Don't feel like you need a profound contribution.

  

  Share:

  - One dream

  - One question

  - One thing you tried

  - One connection you noticed

  

  Start there. The rest will unfold.
