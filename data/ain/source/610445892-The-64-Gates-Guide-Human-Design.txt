the 64 gates guide
An often overlooked part of our Human Design is the planetary aspect of the
gates. As a former astrology lover turned Human Design expert, I wanted to
provide you with the exact thought process I go through when preparing for a
session and exploring the gates.

The 64 Gates Guide is meant to help you understand each of your unique gifts
in Human Design, alongside the theme of the planet they fall into. In this
guide, I offer characterizations of each of the 64 gates and a worksheet to fill
out based on your unique design.

My hope is that The 64 Gates Guide serves as a resource for you to remind
yourself of your gifts.




What are gates?
Speaking of gates, what the heck are they?! Gates are all the numbers in our
Human Design chart. They represent a specific quality, or gift, that has the
potential to be alive within us. When we lean into our gifts, we learn more
about our potential in life. When we add the layer of the planetary
placements, we learn more about the specific theme this gift plays.

Locate your 26 gate activations
On each side of your Human Design chart are columns with
numbers next to planetary symbols. There are 13 on each
side making up 26 total. Each of these numbers is one of your
gates. See the next page for more information on how to
locate them.

Once you've located your 26 gates, fill in the gates guide. This
will help you understand the gifts of your gates.

         LOCATING GATES


IN YOUR CHART
After looking up your chart, you need to locate each column:
subconscious vs. Conscious. Each of these columns contains 13 gates,
making up 26 total gate activations.

Each number in the column will contain a symbol, a number (gate), and



                                                          ☉1 . 5
another number after a decimal point (line).

The symbol represents the planet the gate falls into,
which contains an overall theme to the gate.

The first number next to the symbol is the gate, or the gift, you have.

The number after the decimal point is the line, which adds nuance to how
this gate, or gift, is expressed through the theme of the planet.



subconscious vs conscious
Subconscious gates (blue) are gifts were
not as aware of, but other people tend to
recognize them within us. This is how we
move through the world.

Conscious gates (pinkish) are gifts we are
usually aware of, as they are from this life.
These are whom you think you are.
