             THE ASTROLOGY         OF I CHING

Dr Wen Kuan Chu described himself as a seeker of truth
through science, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism          and
Western Mysticism. He gained a PhD from the University of
California at Berkeley and was before his death Director
of the East-West Essence Society, Santa Ana, California.

Wallace A. Sherrill was a Fellow of the China Academy. He
gained a BA in Philosophy from the University of Washing-
ton and an MA in History from Georgetown University. He
lived in mainland China for two years and spent three years in
Taiwan, where he carried out cultural research. He was also
engaged, until his death, in research and writings relating to
metaphysics and parapsychology in Los Angeles.

Dr Wen Kuan Chu and Wallace A. Sherrill were also co-
authors of An Anthology of I Ching, also published by Arkana.

Preface



The Astrology of I Ching is based on a manuscript written in
ancient classical Chinese, the title of which, translated literally, is
'Ro Map Lo Map Rational Number'.
   The Astrology of I Ching is the product of translations and
interpretations made by W. K. Chu, Ph.D., edited and amplified
by myself. Dr Chu is among the rare Chinese scholars who are
qualified to translate and interpret classical Chinese. Classical
Chinese is written in ancient characters and without any
punctuation. Many interpretations can be made, but few are the
scholars who can truly provide the meaning and intent of what
is written. I myself am a Sinophile and have lived in China
several times in my life, as well as having studied I Ching at
Fu Jen University in Taipei, Taiwan. The resultant book in
English is such that it retains much of its ancient flavor, yet is
modernized sufficiently to be understandable to and usable by
Westerners.

Introduction



The greater the understanding one has of I Ching, The Book of
Changes, the more accurate will one's interpretations be of The
Astrology of I Ching. Both are based on the same concepts and
derivations. Both share in ageless Chinese knowledge and philo-
sophy. This is only natural, since I Ching is reputedly the
embodiment of all things, and its applications are universal.
There is only one development of Yang and Yin and their
evolution into trigrams and hexagrams. What is different between
the two books, though, is the application here of the Celestial
Stems and Horary Branches, as a basis for determining the
appropriate natal hexagram with its controlling line, and the
subsequent evolvement into yearly and daily predictions.
   The systems for using I Ching for astrological purposes were
first set forth by scholars of the Ming Dynasty. As frequently
happens with Chinese works, when this astrology was first
presented it was attributed to a famous scholar in order to get it
accepted rather than who actually developed the ideas being
revealed. The Ming scholars said they were merely presenting
what Shao Yung (1011-77) had taught. Others claim that its
origin goes back many centuries earlier. What the Ming scholars
are reputed to have done in developing The Astrology of I Ching
is to have synthesized and molded ancient concepts into some-
thing plausible and usable, and they began with the concept of
time.
   Time, as understood by the ancient Chinese, is quite different
from the literal definition we give it today. Observations, studies
and analyses of the cosmos and its influences, coupled with those
of the earth and its manifestations, resulted in a sexagenary
system of time. From the greatest division to the least division,
the same system is applicable. From their studies, the scholars
                                                                 1
Introduction
came to believe that there are two systems of forces acting on the
earth, namely, those from out in space, called cosmic or celestial,
and those generated within and by the earth itself. Five dominant
cosmic influences were found, and these were given the names:
wood, fire, earth, metal and water. Each of these has its positive
and negative aspects. These five influences are also known as
elements. The sequence in which they are given above comes
from the way they react and interact with one another, and is
the order in which they should always be considered. For ease of
calculation, the five celestial influences, in their positive and
negative aspects, are here designated by capital letters, A through
J. They have repeated themselves in this sequence from the time
when the sun, earth, moon, and all the planets of our solar
system, were in a straight line at the time of the winter solstice.
These same studies showed the earth's manifestations and
radiations to repeat in cycles of twelve. Today they are called the
twelve Rorary Branches, the word 'horary' having been adopted
from the West. The literal translation of the classical Chinese
character would be 'Earthly Branch.' For ease of calculation,
they are designated by the lower case alphabetical letters, a
through 1.
   The matching of the ten Celestial Stems, A through J, with
the twelve Horary Branches, a through 1, produces sexagenary
cycles, which are basic to the astrology set forth herein. The
commencement of the cycle, naturally, is A and a, or Aa, then
Bb, Cc, ... Jj, Ak, Bl, etc. Carrying this forward, one finds sixty
steps between each succeeding Aa.
   The foregoing concept of time became the basis for Chinese
culture. What we consider literally as time, i.e. hours, minutes
and seconds, are but an advancement and refinement of the basic
concept for practical purposes. In their striving to make practical
use of their knowledge and their concept of time, the Chinese
scholars developed, among other things, systems of astrology
based on the sexagenary cycle. Using I Ching as one of the
foundations for their astrology was but a natural and logical
development.
   The Astrology 0/ I Ching is the most complete of the three
astrologies associated with I Ching. The Nine House Astrology
adopts the Lo Map and the meanings of the trigrams only. It
does not consider the hexagrams as a whole, nor the meanings
a
                                                      Introduction
of the individual lines, so it is not truly worthy of being called
I Ching astrology. The other system is the 'Iron Plate Divine
Number' concept, but this is secret and not available.
   Perhaps the reader has already observed that the Chinese had a
concept of time being both positive and negative. This is not
negative in the normal sense, any more than Yin and K'un are
destructively negative. Rather, the positive and negative are
parts of the eternal cycles, and should be considered as comple-
ments rather than opposites. Thus, everything that occurs has its
right place and proper usefulness. This idea is, and has been,
reflected in Chinese culture throughout its history, and has
profoundly affected Chinese thought as well. The use of the
positive and negative forces at any given moment plays a vital
role in I Ching astrology.
    The combination of the cosmic and earthly forces in play at any
given moment are peculiar to the year, month, day, hour and
minute in question. All of these cycles can be represented by the
appropriate combinations of Celestial and Horary symbols. As
will be seen in the text, by adding up all the odd numbers, one
will obtain a total which will determine the heavenly trigram,
while the sum of all the even numbers will determine the earthly
trigram. The system as devised, regrettably, is only applicable for
Northern hemisphere calculations.
    Two dichotomies exist which need to be considered jointly.
In I Ching, man is designated as positive (Ch'ien, Male, Yang)
and woman, his counterpart, as negative (K'un, Female, Yin).
Years in I Ching astrology are alternately positive and negative.
A man's or woman's Celestial Stem influence is greatest in the
years that match their respective nature, i.e. is uppermost in
those years in which the polarities are the same. The year and
the person then tend to harmonize with each other. Con-
sequently, if born in a positive year, a man's heavenly trigram is
 at the top of his natal hexagram, while a woman's is below;
conversely for negative years.
    As stated above, the earth's influence follows the Horary
pattern. As a result, in ancient times, the day was divided into
twelve two-hour periods. The day begins at midnight; however,
the Yang forces begin returning at 11 p.m., so for calculation pur-
poses the first of the twelve two-hour segments was designated as
 from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m., and given the symbol 'a.' The additional

                                                                     3
      Introduction
       two-hour segments up to II a.m, were designated 'b,' 'c,' 'd,'
       'e,' and "f,' with the Yin hours, II a.m, to II p.m., indicated by
       'g,' 'h,' 'i,' 'j,' 'k,' and '1,' respectively. The Yang force entering
       before the midnight of a new day harmonizes with the Yang
       force entering before the beginning of the new year, in accordance
       with its position in the Later Heaven Sequence of trigrams. Days
       and years parallel each other in the cycle of events.
III        Years also were divided by twelve, into months. The astrological
      year begins with the winter solstice, which is the mid-point of the
       eleventh month. The winter solstice is the basis for all yearly and
      subsequent calculations.
          Out of the sum of the numbers representing the place, date,
      hour and minute of birth, one develops a natal or 'Pre-Heaven'
      hexagram, with a controlling line. This forms the basis for natal
      predictions, and governs the ascending phase of one's life. By
      reversing the trigrams one develops the Later Heaven hexagram,
      which controls the descending phase of one's life. Both, however,
      can be modified by karma and the exercise of one's free will. The
      lines in the two hexagrams each govern in turn a shorter cycle of
      one's life, and the numerical value of each is considered as if it
      were a moving line in the basic I Ching, i.s, a Yin line as six and
      a Yang line as nine. Therefore, a Yin line controls for a period of
      six years and a Yang line for nine years. Appropriate subcycles
      are thus formed for the different phases of life.
          The predictions given are based on the interaction of the two
      trigrams making up each hexagram, with consideration of the
      position of the controlling line. When elements work in harmony
      or forces cooperate, then favorableness and success are predicted.
      The degree is determined by the known interaction of such
      elements or farces.
          It will be noted that there are predictions for the 'Most
      Auspicious' and for the 'Least Auspicious.' This is based on the
      concept of reincarnation, whereby each soul returns at a certain
      level and under circumstances determined by his or her karma.
      Thus, two boys (or two girls) born in the same hospital at the
      same moment would have the same natal hexagram and con-
      trolling line, but one would be more auspicious than the other
      (except in extremely rare cases). Those born at the same time
      and in the same place on the whole have parallel influences in
      their lives, and are known as 'time twins.'

      4
                                                      Introduction
   Fortunately, man has a certain degree of control over his
destiny. By improving himself inwardly, a man can raise his
level of auspiciousness. This can be done by observing the lessons
to be learned during the course of the cycles of the hexagrams
which repeat themselves frequently in his life. These hexagrams
 are of especial importance to him. Whether he increases his
auspiciousness during his life will be determined by how well he
learns the lessons set before him, coupled, of course, with his
karma.
   The forces acting on an individual's life are never static.
Furthermore, there are no clear-cut starting or stopping points.
Therefore, in addition to one's natal hexagram, one should look
at two other hexagrams to obtain a more complete picture of
oneself. These are (1) the 'inner' hexagram, which is composed
of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the natal hexagram for the lower trigram,
and lines 3,4, and 5 for the upper trigram; and (2) the hexagram
which would be formed by using the preceding or succeeding
time group closest to the minute of birth; e.g. if born at 12.30
a.m., which is in the Yang 'a' period, one should develop a
hexagram for the 'b' period and note the dominant characteristics,
which are likely to have an influence on one. If, on the other
hand, one was born shortly before midnight, one should develop
a hexagram for the previous'!' period and note the dominant
aspects of it. The inner hexagram mainly shows what the
individual is or should be like inwardly, while the natal hexagram
itself covers the principal external considerations.
   The daily predictions, in some cases, may be hard to understand.
At first glance, what is said may not seem too appropriate. One
must look at both the external and inner influences to discern the
value and usefulness of the prediction. In some cases, too, it
should be taken literally and in others figuratively. No two
persons will extract exactly the same meaning from what is said.
Furthermore, at different times in one's life, when a daily
prediction is repeated, it will require a different interpretation
as well. It is only by hindsight that the true meanings become
fully manifest, hence it behoves one to analyze what is said in the
light of occurrences. With considerable experience, inter-
pretations will gradually become more lucid. Also, by following
the advice given, one will slowly improve oneself inwardly, and
have a better life externally. At some point in life one will

                                                                 5
Introduction
recognize that one's life has improved as a result of following the
advice given, and from observing the cautions contained therein.
At that point, one may also recognize that 'inanimate' objects
have life and spirit as well as 'animate' beings, and thereby
obtain an increased insight into the oneness of the universe.
   Thus one can readily see that The Astrology of I Ching is far
more than just a book of portents. It is a complete philosophy
and way of life as well. Repeatedly, it points out the attributes
and the value of 'the superior man.' It shows which courses are
superior and which are inferior. At the same time, it shows how to
handle any situation, and the improvements man can make by
following the laws of heaven and earth.
   The basic point to remember is that all life on earth is affected
by the interaction of the earthly forces with the celestial forces at
any given moment. The interaction of these forces is the basis of
total time as far as our planet is concerned. The time expressed in
the sexagenary cycles, both large and small, is a reflection of
these influences and provides an expression for the particular
influences at a particular instant. That, fundamentally, is why the
vast majority of Chinese people believe in astrology and look for
the best possible ways to interpret the celestial and earthly
influences. Many feel the I Ching, with its universal application,
is the best medium for such interpretation.
   The value and benefits which can be found in The Astrology of
I Ching are available to everyone. Find them, use them, and a
rich and rewarding life can be yours.

Foundations
What a truly superb document of ancient wisdom we have in the
book I Ching! Properly understood, it is a guide for daily affairs
and actions in all circumstances. According to the Chinese, it is
the basis of all there is in the universe, and reflects the inter-
relationship of all elements and aspects, spiritual and material.
Any situation or condition man may find himself in, or can
imagine, is included within the scope and meanings of I Ching.
It is based on heaven and its laws as manifested on this earth, and
thus is applicable to any science, discipline, or even the most
remote mundane consideration. It embraces all that there is.
Perhaps its greatest value, for those who can understand it, lies
in showing man the right path for spiritual development. And
now, in conjunction with the foregoing, it can be used for
astrological predictions, based on the influences existing at the
time of birth conjoined with the dimension of time. These follow
the pattern of known laws, and hence matters are predictable.
These predictions are for the material realm, but need not be
inevitable, since man has free will, and the realm of spirit, in
which free will operates, can override the material realm in
which these natural laws operate.
   The question naturally arises as to why a 'Book of Changes,'
based on hexagrams, should lend itself to reliable astrological
predictions. The answer, strange as it may seem, lies within the
question itself. The Book is based on the manifestations of the
universe converted into natural laws. Furthermore, the seeds of
the past determine the present, and the seeds of the present
determine the future. As an example, we can observe an oak
sapling. We immediately know two things, namely, that it came

                                                                 7
1   I   Background and Computations
 from an acorn, and its approximate age, from its size and height.
 We can envisage that under normal circumstances it will become
a full-grown oak tree, of a size befitting the climate and cir-
cumstances in which it finds itself. Another reliability factor is
the fact that the hexagrams are the result of the evolutionary
process of Yin and Yang, the two primal forces, and therefore
reflect the various fundamental situations in the universe. Yin
and Yang are the positive and negative forces through which the
Universal Creative manifests itself. Thus the hexagrams sym-
bolically represent any situation man can encounter. So, with the
hexagrams representing the multifarious situations in which a
man can find himself, and with the changes in these situations
following natural and observable laws, the astrology of I Ching,
properly understood and interpreted, can be used reliably by
those who care to use it.
   I Ching goes back as far as Fu Hsi who ruled before the Flood
(c. 3000 B.C.), * and the basis of the astrology of I Ching may go
back that far too. Evidence of the recording of sexagenary cycles
goes back as far as Huang Ti (the Yellow Emperor). At that time,
I Ching was being transmitted as easily memorizable verse. It
may be assumed that knowledge of the cycles could have been
transmitted likewise. It was not until around 1123 B.C. that King
Wen and his son, the Duke of Chou, set I Ching down in writing,
and provided explanations for the judgments and lines. Confucius
(551-479 B.C.) wrote commentaries on I Ching, and later
scholars were also interested in these matters. Some sources say
that our present expanded system of astrology comes from Chen
Tuan, a famous immortal during the Sung Dynasty, with the
work subsquently being completed by Shao Yung during the
same dynastic period. Others say that it was the work of Ming
scholars, and attributed to Shao Yung.
   As most scholars know, the shell and bone language and usage
were developed to record oracular communications for kings.
Evidence of astrological predictions has been found on shell and
bone relics, but these are not as yet identifiable to any specific
system. They have, however, been used to help trace the origin
of the sexagenary cycles, on which this astrology is based.

                                  1 /    Background   and Computations
Basically, there are three systems of I Ching astrology:
1. T'ieh Pan Shen Shu, which, translated        literally, means 'Iron
Plate Divine Number.' This is a secret system, reputedly
developed by the same Shao Yung mentioned above. It is known
only to a few chosen people, and is passed on verbally to a select
few. It is a numerological system whereby one can compute a
set of numbers for a specific purpose, e.g. if the computation came
up with the numbers I, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3, 2, the meaning could be
'Y ou are going to bear a son as your first child.' This system is
still secret today.
2. Ho Lo Li Shu, which translated literally means 'Ho Map Lo
Map Rational Number,' the Ho Map being Figure 1, and the
Lo Map referring to the Later Heaven Sequence of trigrams and
the Magic Square of three (Figures 2 and 3)'

The trigrams with their evolution and additional meanings will
be discussed in detail subsequently (see chapter 2 pp. 61-4).
This much will suffice here:

   There are two basic sequences of the trigrams, one is called
the 'Later Heaven Sequence' and the other the 'Earlier' or 'Pre-
Heaven Sequence.' The Earlier Heaven represents everything
as it is in heaven, as well as all thoughts prior to their manifesta-
tion on earth. The Later Heaven is the earthly fulfilment and
consummation of the Earlier Heaven, and represents conditions
as they are on earth, as brought about by heaven.
   Figures 1 and 2 can be turned into a numerological system,
and this is what will be described in this book. As stated above, it
was probably revealed by Chen Tuan and completed by Shao
Yung.
3. Chiu Kung Ming Li, the third system, is the 'Nine House
Astrology' or 'Nine Star Astrology,' but these words do not have
the same meanings as 'house' and 'star' in Western astrology,
and should not be confused with the latter. This system is
developed from the Lo Map (Figure 2 above) but has nothing to
do with the Ho Map (Figure 1). Rather, the nine numbers
involved are associated with colors, which are equally symbolic
and have many meanings. The color associations are:

1. white                 4. green                     7. red
2. black                 5. yellow                    8. white
3. jade green            6. white                     9. purple

   The Nine Star Astrology is the basis of the science of Chinese
geomancy, which has developed as an important branch of this
astrology. The Chinese use geomancy primarily for the deter-
mination of favorable sites for establishing businesses, for buying
or renting houses, for ascertaining the most propitious rooms for
specific purposes, and for selecting burial sites, etc. I Ching is
also used for this.
                                                                      11
1   I   Background   and Computations
   Another branch of this astrology is known as 'directionology,'
whereby one can determine the yearly, monthly, and daily
directions to follow, for favorable, neutral or unfavorable results.
It is used mainly for such matters as business, vacations, finding
the right partner or party, tactics in battle, etc.

Systems 1 and 3 above are mentioned solely for the reader's
general information, so that he is aware that such systems
exist.
   Some Chinese systems use the beginning of spring as their
time base, but the system described herein uses the winter
solstice as its starting point.
   Referring back to Figure 1, it is to be noted that five elements
are shown, namely, wood, fire, earth, metal and water. These,
according to the Chinese, are the basic elements of the universe,
and as they each act in both a positive and a negative aspect, the
five, thus doubled in effect, become the ten Celestial Stems. It
should be noted that these elements agree basically with those of
the early Western philosophers, the Greeks in particular.
   The names of the elements are extreme simplifications. While
they represent many different things, among the more important
we find:

    Wood -      vitality, east (when the sun rises in the east a sense
                of vitality and vigor comes over the earth), the
                spring, the liver, green (or the color of young shoots);
    Fire -      the sun, fighting, brilliance, summer, the heart,
                south, red;
    Earth -     yellow, middle, the spleen, the abdomen, the four
                seasons (the seasons are brought about by the
                interaction of the earth and the sun, but they belong,
                as a complete cycle, to the earth);
    Metal-      autumn, west (symbolizing decline), white, the
                lungs;
    Water -     winter, the kidneys, black, north, hidden things
                (from winter, when all things tend to hide or
                become inactive).

  The progressive sequence of these elements in the material
world (Later Heaven) is:
                                      1   I   BackfJround and Computations
   Wood gives birth to fire;
   fire gives birth to earth;
   earth gives birth to metal;
   metal gives birth to water;
   water gives birth to wood.

The above sequence is used in the astrology presented here.
Another sequence, used for different purposes, is:

   Wood conquers (overcomes) earth;
   earth conquers (overcomes) water;
   water conquers (overcomes) fire;
   fire conquers (overcomes) metal;
   metal conquers (overcomes) wood.

    From these sequences one observes that the five elements form
 cycles, through creation or through subjugation. Furthermore, if
 wood gives birth to fire, it means that the potentiality of fire is in
the wood itself; and, if fire gives birth to earth, the potentiality
 of earth is in the fire, etc. Therefore, the five elements are not
 five different and distinct things, but are one cosmic force,
 differentiated into five appearances by time and space.
    The five elements are very important in Chinese astrology and
in medical philosophy. For instance, all the parts of the body are
connected to form the whole. The parts should not be treated
individually, since a strong relationship with some other part
always exists, e.g. if the liver is not in good condition this will
have an effect on the heart, since wood (liver) gives birth to fire
(heart). The heart, in turn, will affect some other part ofthe body.
Strengthening medications will not only improve a particular
organ but others as well. Thus, if we strengthen the kidneys by
some means it will also vitalize the liver, because water (kidneys)
gives birth to wood (liver).
    A similar sequential effect of the elements is considered as
taking place within the sequences of trigrarns which generate
the computations for the astrological predictions. The relation-
ship of the trigrams to the elements is shown in Fu Hsi's Earlier
Heaven (also called Pre-Heaven) Sequence. (Figure 4,)
    The matching of the trigram.s* (and their respective positive

Note that two of the elements share the same pair of trigrams and
numbers, but the Celestial Stems are not identical, giving them
different meanings and relationships. Also,there is no number five.
   The astrological aspects of this book are based on the inter-
relationship and interaction of the foregoing ten Celestial Stems
with the twelve Horary Branches. The effects produced are
ascertainable from the system of rational numbers assigned to
the Celestial Stems and the Horary Branches.
   The twelve Horary Branches and their numbering are as
follows:

      Hai                    1 and 6                   water

Referring back to Figure 1 (page 9) it is to be noted that each
element in the Ho Map has two numbers. These numbers are the
same as those tabulated for each element above, the Ho Map
having formed the basis for the values. Earth being represented
four times is indicative of its interaction with each of the other
four elements. The numbering, other than that of earth, which
is given five and ten, goes from north to east to south to west.
North (water) is also winter, the time when the new astrological
year begins, and hence is logically given the number one.


The Sexagenary: Cycles
A sexagenary (sixty-year) cycle is used in I Ching astrology. It is
formed by the interrelationship and interaction of the ten
Celestial Stems with the twelve Horary Branches. It would, at

                                                                   15
1   I   Background and Computations
first glance, appear that the cycle should be 120 years, i.e. ten
times twelve, or the product of the total number of Stems and
Branches. As mentioned above, the Stems and the Branches each
have their positive and negative aspects, but here only the
positive are conjoined with the positive, and the negative ~th
the negative, hence the number sixty. From the mathematical
point of view, sixty is the lowest common denominator of ten
and twelve.
   The starting point of the sexagenary cycle is said to have been
about a million years ago, at the time of the winter solstice when
the sun, the moon, all the planets, and the earth were in a straigbt
line at midnight. The sexagenary cycle has been computed frozn
that time to the present and has had the calendar adjusted to it.
It will be noted that there are three different sexagenary sub-
cycles, called Upper, Middle and Lower. The use of three
sexagenary cycles instead of just one began in the Ming Dynasty
in order to match this astrology to the Nine Star astrology. The
lowest common denominator for the two astrologies is 180 years,
so since a sixty-year cycle is used here, three subcycles develop
(three times sixty equals 180).
   According to Chinese astrological calculations, the present
sexagenary cycle is the Middle Cycle (extending from 1924-
through 1983). The Lower Cycle will be 1984 through 2043. The
previous Upper Cycle was 1864 through 1923. (See Tables 3a,
Sb and 3c.)
   For ease of calculation, capital alphabetical letters are assigned
to the ten Celestial Stems, and small alphabetical letters to the
Horary Branches. Their positive and negative characteristics are
also shown in Table 1.

      and once negative, while earth appears positive twice and negative twice.

  TRUE       LOCAL     TIME
  True local time rnust be used in determing the hour and minute
  of birth, before entering the appropriate tables. Since the cal-
  culations in tbis book are based on longitude 120 degrees
  East, it wi]] be necessary to correct time: (a) for longitude;
  (b) for daYlight;-saving time, or other local time adjustments.
  (Hawaii, for e"aIIlple, for many years used time zone lot.)
     Longitude corrections should be made by adding one minute
 of time for each fifteen minutes of longitude the location is
 east of the standard time meridian, or subtracting one minute of
 time for each fifteen minutes of longitude the location is west of
 the standard time       meridian (see Table 8a). An additional
 correction must be also made, using Table 8b.

                                     1   I   Background and Computations
       I Ching is based on observations of heaven and earth. The
    astrology of I Ching is, additionally, based on observations of the
    sun. Hence "the sun's position with respect to the earth must be
    considered. The sun progresses roughly four minutes daily.
    Since i eo degrees East is the reference longitude, one must add
    one minute of time for each ninety degrees (to the nearest
    forty-five degrees) the location involved is west of 120°E., or as
    shown in Table 8b.

                   Table 8b    Time corrections (longitude)

                       1 minute for 30°E. (±45°)
                       2 minutes for 600W. (±45°)
                       3 minutes for 1500W. (±45°)

     Examples      a. Kia/ua, Hawaii. December 17, 1935. Clock reading
     10.58 a.rn. Longitude 157° 45' W. Time zone lot, with the
     standard tinle meridian being 157° 30' W. 1570 43' W. is 13'
     west of the standard meridian. Enter Table 8a, and nearest to 13'
     one finds that a correction of one minute of time is necessary.
     Since the location (Kialua) is west of the time meridian, subtract
     the correction, i.e. 10.58 minus one minute is 10.57 a.m, From
     Table 8b, it; is apparent that one needs to add three minutes as a
    ·longitude correction. However, as Hawaii was time zone lOi at
     the date given, so one needs to correct to the nearest standard
     time zone, which in this case is 165° W. (Table 8a.) This correc-
     tion is thirty minutes oftime for 7io, and since the location is east
     of this meridian, the thirty minutes are added. The true astro-
     logical time is, therefore: 10·57 a.m.       +3   + 50 minutes =
    11.50 a.rn.
    b. Charleston, South Carolina. Longitude 80° W. 12.08 a.m,
    November 3, 1970. The standard meridian is 75° W., hence
    Charleston is eighty minus seventy-five, or five degrees west of
    the standard meridian. From Table 8a one finds that the correction
    is twenty nrinutes of time and in this case it is to be subtracted.
    For 80° W. the longitude correction is two minutes (Table 8b).
    So the true astrological time is 12.08 a.m. - 20          +
                                                             2 minutes
     = 11.50 p.m. November 2.
    c. Las Vegas, Nevada. July 15, 1972. 1,15 a.m. reported time.
    Longitude 115° 50' W. The standard time meridian is 120° W.
                                                                       27
1   I   Background   and Computations
Therefore, Las Vegas is 40 30' east of the standard time meridian.
From Table 8a, this necessitates a correction of sixteen minutes
for 4" and two minutes for the 30', or a total of eighteen minutes.
July 15 is during daylight saving time, so an hour must be
subtracted. Also, for 115 W., three minutes must be added for
                            0



the longitude correction (Table 8b). Therefore, the true astro-
logical time is 1.15 a.m, + (18 + 3 minutes) - 1 hour = 12.36
a.m, July 15.


The basic computation
The objective now is to find a numerical value for the date, time
and place under consideration, in order to determine the heavenly
and earthly trigrams, with which to construct the controlling
natal hexagram from which the predictions are obtained. The
year, month, day, and hour will each have three numbers. When
these have been determined, all the odd numbers will be added
together to provide the numerical basis for the heavenly trigram,
while the sum of all the even numbers will provide the earthly
trigram.

STEPS
1. Find the true astrological local time and date of birth, using
Tables 8a and 8b, along with the instructions for their use.
   2. Enter Table 3 and find the yearly cycle number.
   3. Using this number, enter Table 2 to find the symbols for
the year involved.
   4. Enter Table 1 with these symbols, and find the numbers
involved for the year. Make a note of these numbers.
   5. Using the correct date and true astrological time (step 1),
enter Table 4 to determine the month to be used in the cal-
culations. The astrological forces overlap so that there is never a
clear-cut beginning or ending. Consequently, if the date and
time of birth are close to the end of one month or the beginning
of another, develop natal hexagrams for both months and
interpolate the predictions. The times given in Table 4 are good
enough for most calculations, whatever the year, but for best
results the double calculation should be performed. (For greater
accuracy, see Appendix A, p. 438. Especially note leap year
dates.)

   6. Enter Table 5 with the Celestial Stem letter designation for
the year (step 3) along with the astrological month determined
in step 5, and find the symbols for the month.
   7. Go to Table 1, and find the numerical designations for
these symbols. Make a note of these numbers.
   8. Enter Table 6 with the day and month, and find the cycle
number. Note this. Remember to check whether a leap year is
involved.
   9. Enter Table :), and find the daily cycle number for the year
involved.
    10. Add the numbers obtained from steps 8 and 9.
    11. Enter Table 2, and find the alphabetical designation for
the number obtained from step 10 (if necessary subtract sixty
from the total to get a number between one and sixty).
    12. Go to Table 1, and find the numerical     designations for
these, the daily symbols. Make a note cif these numbers.
    15. Enter Table 7 with the alphabetical designation for the
 daily Celestial Stem (step 11), and find the alphabetical symbols
for the correct local time.
    14. Enter Table 1 with the symbols from step 13, and ascertain
their numerical value. Note down these numbers.
    15. Add all the odd numbers from the four symbols (year,
 month, day and hour), the numbers obtained from steps 4, 7,
 12 and 14. The total will be the heavenly number.·
    16. Add all the even numbers from the four symbols
 (year, month, day and hour). The total will be the earthly
 number.·

Examples
J. Step  1. January 17, 1970.3.50 p.m.j'
         2. For 1970 the yearly cycle is 47
         3. From Table 2, 47 = Gk
         4. G = 5 k = 5 and 10                                     3 5    10
         5. Twelfth month

  This system, using the odd and even numbers from the four symbols, was
recorded and explained by Confucius in his commentariel on I Ching.
t This is true local time. Always determine true local time before proceedinr
with the computations (see pp. ~6-8).

  The combination of the heavenly and earthly trigrams
obtained from Tables 12 and 13 will give the Pre-Heaven
hexagram. To determine which trigram will be the upper, and
which the lower, consult Table L",.

             Table 14    The order of the trigrams

For a man-    For 'positive' year of birth (even-numbered),    the
              heavenly trigram is on the top (upper).
              For 'negative' year of birth (odd-numbered),     the
              heavenly trigram is on the bottom (lower).
For a woman-For   'positive' year of birth (even-numbered),    the
              heavenly trigram is on the bottom (lower).
              For 'negative' year of birth (odd-numbered),     the
              heavenly trigram is on the top (upper).


The development of the basic Pre-Heaven hexagram
The astrology of I Ching is both a science and an art. It is a
science in the computations that have to be performed, and in the
basis on which these calculations are founded. It is an art in the
making of the best possible interpretations from the scientific
data obtained. As in all sciences, there is much that is not easy.
The average person may have some difficulty at first in following
the procedure, but with experience it will be found that it can be
done with ease, and even by rote. As has been stated elsewhere,
there is only the one book available giving details of this system,

                                                                35
1   I   Background   and Computations
 and it is written in the classical Chinese language. This is an
 ancient style, wherein the characters have several meanings and
 are different from their modern usage. Also, no punctuation is
 employed. Very few people are truly qualified to render accept-
 able translations. Another handicap is that it is very terse, with
 limited explanations or none at all.
    The computations for the basic Pre-Heaven hexagram and for
 the controlling line, and the methods for determining the
 hexagrams for the yearly, monthly and daily cycles, are seem-
 ingly complicated. Whether difficult or not, they must be
followed with care, and it is advisable always to double-check the
 work done and the interpretations made, since a minor error
 made along the way can completely alter the final presentation.
    With the work being carefully done, and interpreted with
 understanding, one has a scientific and artistic system.
    Perhaps one should consider the scientific aspects herein in
somewhat the same light as one does the scientific aspects of an
 airplane. Most of us do not know why it was designed as it is,
nor what makes it fly. But it gets us from here to there. So it is
with the material which follows. We will use the data we have,
 and they will serve our purpose.
    Up to this point the computations were all designed to produce
a heavenly number and an earthly number, from which to
develop the Pre-Heaven hexagram. In the study of I Ching, one
learns that heaven, earth and man are coequal partners in the
development of man, and in his experiences. Man, of course,
has the option of exercising his free will. The influences of
heaven and earth at any given time are fixed and predictable.
At the moment of birth, one is not exercising free will, but
heaven and earth are exercising their influence on one. Their
influence is what we are about to determine. The situation can be
likened to the planting of a seed. When influenced by nature
alone, it will grow in a certain way. But when also influenced by
man, the conditions of growth change. The hexagrams are
considered as reflecting the influences of heaven, earth, and man,
with the influence of heaven being primarily in the top two
lines, that of man in the middle two lines, and that of earth in
the bottom two lines. This pattern comes into playas life pro-
gresses, but the heavenly and earthly trigrams form the basis of
all the lifetime influences.
                               1   I   Background   and Computations
   For astrological purposes, one needs this basic hexagram
representing the time and location of birth in order to derive the
subsequent hexagrams that influence the phases of life. The basic
hexagram is the seed from which the pattern of life unfolds. In
this blossoming, good or unfavorable auguries can be determined.
However, as stated above, man, with his free will operating in
the realm of spirit, can override the realm of fate and either
improve or impair the natural conditions prevailing (whether
this astrology is used, or any other astrology).

Having carried out the basic computations described on pages
28-30, and having determined the heavenly and earthly
numbers, one must enter Tables 12 and 13 to obtain the heavenly
and earthly trigrams.
   Using example 1 from page 30, one finds:

          Heavenly number: 46
          Earthly number: 28
                                       The trigram is _
                                       The trigram is ::::
                                                              =
   Three things need to be done. The first is to ascertain whether
the year of birth is positive or negative; the second, to note
whether the subject is male or female; and third, in the event of
the heavenly number being 5, 15, 25, 30, 40 or 50, one must
note whether the year of birth is in the Upper, the Middle, or the
Lower Cycle, i.e, 1864 to 1923, 1924 to 1983, or 1984 to 2043.
(See Table 12, p. 34,)
    Even-numbered years are 'positive' and odd-numbered years
 are 'negative.' (The first year of an Upper, Middle or Lower
 Cycle is always a positive year, e.g. 1864, 1924, 1984, etc.)
    The time of birth in our example was 3.50 a.m, January
 17, 1970. This is a positive year.
    We shall work the example for a man and for a woman. The
 next step is to enter Table 14 on page 35. Since 1970 is a positive
 year, the heavenly trigram will be on top for a man, and in the
 lower position for a woman. The Pre-Heaven hexagrams are
 therefore:

The development of the controlling line
While the Pre-Heaven hexagram gives the broad picture, it is the
controlling line of the hexagram that is especially important. It is
from this that all the subsequent patterns of hexagrams, for the

~8
                                1   I   Background   and Computations
yearly and daily cycles, develop. And, as one would imagine, it is
the time of birth that is used as the basis for determining the
controlling line.
   The importance of the controlling line is that it is the foundation
for the pattern of the subsequent age subcycles, and at the end of
these becomes the foundation for the Later Heaven hexagram,
which holds the seeds of the senior years of one's life. Since it
influences all that follows from the moment of birth, it is rightfully
called the controlling line.
   The lines of the Pre-Heaven hexagram are given an alpha-
betical designation in a manner which will be described, and by
this means the controlling line can be found. It is that line which
carries the appropriate alphabetical designation obtained from
Table 15.




Every hexagram has, of course, nought to six Yang and nought
to six Yin lines in a specific combination. The system of designat-
ing these lines is shown for the seven possible combinations, each
of the first five having one set of rules for the Yin hours and
another for the Yang hours (see Table 15 for the Yin and Yang
hours).

                                                                   59

   It should be remembered in the development of the cycles of
life that the controlling line is more important than the basic
hexagram, since the interpretation of the lines is always more
specific than that of the hexagram as a whole. In a sense, the
hexagram can be considered as the 'cause' and the controlling
line the resultant 'effect.' It is the manifested 'effect' which is of
prime interest in astrological prediction.
   Referring back to pages 37-8, and Examples 1 and 2, the
controlling lines for the hexagrams can now be determined.
Example 1 Time: 3.50 p.m. From Table 15, the controlling
letter is 'i,' and the time in the Yin hours. Consulting Case 2
above, it can be seen that the Yin lines are numbered in sequence
from the bottom upwards, followed by the Yang lines. Hence:
                  Man                            Woman
                 -   -j                           ----1
                 ----1                            - -j
Hexagram         -x-i               Hexagram      -x-i
   59            ----k                  ••.       -   -h
                 -   -h                           ----k
                 -   -g                           -   -g
The controlling line is the 'i' line, line 4 in both instances. Since
it is a Yin line, the fact that it controls is shown by placing a cross




                                 -
between the broken lines. In the event of the controlling line
being a Yang, a circle is added to show that it controls; i.e.


Example 2 The time is 12.36 a.m, This is case 3. The time is
within the Yang hours. Therefore all the Yang lines receive

42
                                1   I   Background and Computations
double lettering. (Had the time been within the Yin hours, all
the Yin lines would have received double lettering.) The
controlling letter, from Table 15, is 'a.'
                 Man                                Woman
                                                     ---e,f
                                                     ---h,e
Hexagram     ---e,f                     Hexagram

             _a,d
                                                     _a,d

Note that the controlling line in both instances is the bottom
Yang line. In one case it is line 1, and in the other, line 2.
IMPORTANT: Be sure to use the right time group (Yin hours or
 Yang), and check that you have lettered the hexagram according
to the rules for the case involved.

Computations for the suhcycles of life
Basically, what is to be considered here is the pulse of cosmic
influences on the life of the individual. These forces act on every-
one, but individuals vary in their receptivity and reactions,
depending mainly on their natal pattern. The subcycles are the
major divisions of a man's life, and are determined from the
lines of his natal hexagram. The length of the subcycle for a
Yang line is nine years, while that for a Yin line is six years. This
difference originates in the values placed on the lines in the
fundamental theory of I Ching.
   To determine the cycles, one begins with the Pre-Heaven, or
natal, hexagram and its controlling line. If the controlling line is
a Yin, then the first subcycle lasts for six years, if a Yang, then
nine years. The other lines are considered in turn, moving up-
wards from the controlling line and assigning the years line by
line, until the top of the hexagram is reached. Then one continues
from the bottom, until the controlling line is arrived at once more.
   In our Example 1, this simple calculation would be:
                 Man                                Woman
           16-     -21                             13---21
           7---15                                  7-      -12

           34---42                                 39-     -42
           28- -33                                 28---36
           22-     -27                             22-     -27

                                                                     45
1   I   Background and Computations
Note that the length of time involved is the same, but that
different cyclic periods are applicable.
   The numbers indicate the individual's age for the subcycle.
When using these in subsequent calculations, the year of birth
should be noted alongside, to ascertain whether positive or
negative year rules apply. In this astrology the age of an
individual is measured from winter solstice to winter solstice, the
period from the date of birth to the first winter solstice after
birth being year one.


The Later Heaven hexagram
The Later Heaven hexagram is the foundation for the individual's
life subsequent to the years dominated by the Earlier (Pre-)
Heaven hexagram. The Pre-Heaven hexagram determines the
development of the individual, and the Later Heaven hexagram
determines the second half of life, the reaping of the harvest.
As such, the original influences have a tendency to be reversed,
and, the Later Heaven hexagram is made up of the heavenly and
earthly trigrams (with a slight modification), but with their
positions reversed.
    It is a simple matter of putting the inner trigram (the lower
three lines) above the outer trigram (the upper three lines).
One additional action, however, must be taken. The controlling
line remains the controlling line in its new position, but if it was
originally a Yang line it changes to a Yin, and vice versa. In our
Example 1 this would give:

                                Man
                  Pre-Heaven                     Later Heaven

(see previous section on subcycles of life, pages 43-4). These

   As is so often the case, there is an exception to the rule. In
this astrology, special consideration must be given to three
hexagrams, when the controlling line is in the fifth position and
the individual born in a negative month (see Table 5 P: 22), or
when the controlling line is in the sixth position and the individual
born in a positive month.
   These hexagrams are hexagram 29, hexagram 3, and hexagram
39·

 Case I When the fifth line is the controlling line, and the
individual born in a negative month:
   Change the controlling line from Yang to Yin. Make no other
change; i.e.:

If the individual's birth month is positive, proceed according to
the normal rule.

individual born in a positive month:

     The development cif the yearly   cycles
     The hexagrams for the six-year period for Yin lines and the
     aine-year period for Yang lines are developed from the appro-
     priate subcycle line of the natal Pre-Heaven and Later Heaven
     hexagrams. The subcycle lines form the base from which the
     applicable yearly hexagrams are computed. Yin lines and Yang
     lines are treated differently.
        The period covered by a yearly hexagram is from one winter
     solstice (w.s.) to the next. In the Chinese lunar system this was
     from the winter solstice about a month before the Lunar New
     Year's Day to the next winter solstice. The lunar year involved
     was the one wherein the vast majority of days were included.
     Converting this to the Western system means that 1978, for
     example, covers from winter solstice (December) 1977 to winter
     solstice (December) 1978. The character of the year would be
     positive since 1978 is a positive year even though the time
     began in 1977. For clarity's sake a few other examples are given:

           1951 - from w.s. 1930 to W.S. 1931   =   negative year
           1954 - from W.s. 1953 to w.s, 1954   =   positive year
           1967 - from w.s. 1966 to W.S. 1967   =   negative year

        It should be remembered that the age in question at any time
     is the year being lived up to the time of the ensuing winter
     solstice. Year 1 is from birth to the next winter solstice. Year 2
     is from the preceding winter solstice to the next winter solstice,
     even though the child, at the start of the year had not reached
     +6

its first birthday. Each ensuing year, of course, is of opposite
polarity.
   An example of how the foregoing applies can be shown by
using Nelson Rockefeller, born July 8, 1908:
  Year  1 = 7-8-08     to W.S. 1908 + year
        2 = w.s. 1908 to w.s. 1909 - year
        3 = w.s. 1909 to W.S. 1910 + year
        4 = W.S. 1910 to w.s. 1911 - year
        5 = W.S. 1911 to w.s. 1912 + year
        6 = W.S. 1912 to w.s, 1913 - year
        7 = w.s. 1913 to w.s. 1914 + year
        8 = w.s, 1914 to w.s. 1915 - year
        9 = w.s. 1915 to w.s. 1916         +
                                        year
       10 = w.s. 1916 to w.s, 1917 - year
       11 = w.s, 1917 to w.s, 1918 + year
       12 is the same as year 2 only 10 years later, i.e.,
          = w.s, 1918 to w.s. 1919 - year.
  And so on.
Rockefeller's prediction for astrological year 70 would be from
winter solstice 1976 to winter solstice 1977. 1977 is a negative
year.
   The best way to demonstrate the development of the yearly
hexagrams is to apply the rules to an actual case.
a. For a Yin line Take the appropriate hexagram and change
the line for the subcycle in question to a Yang. Use this new
hexagram for the first year of the subcycle, and then change the
lines above it for the ensuing years, changing one line for each
year, e.g.:
Ex-president Nixon's subcycle for age fifty-four to sixty:

For the next year it is necessary to go back to the Later Heaven
hexagram and develop the subcycle for age sixty to sixty-six.

b. For a Yang Line As stated before, the character of the
calendar year for the beginning of the subcycle, i.e. whether it is
positive or negative, determines the rules and methods that apply.
    1. For positive (even-numbered) years, e.g. 1920, 1936, 1972,
etc., the Yang subcycle line does not change for the first year of
the subcycle, but becomes the controlling line for that year. For
the second year, its counterpart in the other trigram changes from
Yin to Yang or vice versa (line 4 is the counterpart of line 1,
line 5 that of line 2, and line 6 that of line 3) and becomes the
controlling line for that year. For the third year, the Yang
subcycle line changes to a Yin, and becomes once again the
controlling line. For the ensuing years, the controlling position
moves up in sequence (returning to the bottom after reaching
the top) with the line changing character each time.
    It must be kept well in mind that for the most part the
astrological year will vary from the normal calendar year by one
year. This is because the first astrological year is from time of
birth to the first winter solstice thereafter. Thus when checking
ex-president Nixon's astrological age 34 to see whether it is a
positive or negative year one must compute the calendar year for
 astrological age 34. Richard Nixon was born on January 9, 1913.
Therefore his year 1 is from January 9, 1913 to winter solstice
 1915. Consequently at winter solstice 1946 he is astrologically
 age 34 and this covers from winter solstice 1945 to winter solstice
 1946. The calendar year 1946 is an even or positive year. The
computations, according to the formula given above would be:

      39                                 --42

    2. For negative (odd-numbered) years when the cycle begins,
the controlling Yang line changes to Yin for the first year and
 remains the controlling line. For the second year the controlling
 line changes to its counter position (1 to 4; 2 to 5; 3 to 6; 4 to 1;
 5 to 2; and 6 to 3) and also changes the nature of the line. For
the third year the controlling line moves back to its original
position and changes the line back to a Yang. For the ensuing
six years of the cycle the controlling line moves up and the
lines change their character in sequence.
    For ex-president Nixon's astrological age 73 to 81 where he
has a Yang line in the Later Heaven hexagram one finds that at
the winter solstice of 1985 he reached the astrological age of 73
and that the calculations for age 73 will cover from the winter
solstice 1984 to the winter solstice 1985. Since 1985 is an odd or
negative year the yearly cycle computations for astrological
ages 73 to 81 would be:

Daily cycle calculations
 The several aspects of the yearly hexagram control the daily
 cycles for the entire year. These are closely associated with the
 five elements: water, wood, fire, metal, and earth. (See Ho
 Map, Figure 1, p. g, and pp. 12-15.) Each of these elements is
 considered dominant for about seventy-two days each year, with
the exception of earth, which is given as the principal influence
for seventy-seven days a year. The system described here is new,
 and is an integration of several ancient versions.
    Earth is believed to interact with the other elements at all
times, and to come into dominance over its associated element
 during the last stages before each of the solstices and equinoxes.
 In calculating the length of time between seasons it is found that
between the autumnal and the vernal equinox the number of
 days is more or less exactly 180 days, whereas between the
 vernal and the autumnal equinox are 185 days plus. With this
 astrology being largely based on the influences of the sun and the
 earth, the extra days beyond 560 (5 elements multiplied by 72
 days) are considered to be under the dominance of the element
 earth. Hence, as will be seen subsequently, the hexagrams
 representing the element earth will influence these extra days.
 Compensation is thereby made for the fact that the winter
 solstice varies in its time of commencement during the appro-
 priate days.
    In connection with the foregoing, when one is analyzing any
1    I   Background and Computations
particular day one should also examine the preceding and succeed-
ing days, as the cycles are not precisely defined as to where one
begins and another ends, but rather represent a continuum of
change.
   An astrological year (beginning with the winter solstice) is
dominated by the five elements approximately as follows:

                        (a)   Water   -   72 days
                        (b)   Earth   -   18 days
                        (c)   Wood    -   72 days
                        (d)   Earth   -   20 days
                        (e)   Fire    -   72 days
                        (f)   Earth   -   21 days
                        (g)   Metal   -   72 days
                        (h)   Earth   -   18 days

    Seventy-two days is the length of time it takes for a hexagram
to change to its opposite and then return to its original state,
allowing each line to be the controlling line for a day. The days
start at the bottom line and move upwards. Thus each hexagram
controls a six-day period, before changing into the next hexagram
(the changes entering at the bottom and continuing to the top)
when another six-day cycle takes place. As may be seen below,
a hexagram goes through its complete cycle of evolution in
seventy-two stages, during which the controlling element (water,
wood, fire or metal) goes through its seventy-two-day cycle and
exerts its controlling influence for that period of time according to
its stage of evolution on any given day. Example:

R.eturning now to the consideration of what takes place during a
year, one must begin with the yearly hexagram. As is well
known, each hexagram presents six different aspects, i.e. (1)
itself; (2) its opposite; (5) its reverse; (4) its opposite reverse;
(5) its inner hexagram; and (6) its inner opposite. Placed in
proper perspective, these provide a three-dimensional picture.
Take any hexagram as an example (here hexagram 57 was
chosen):

                --
                --
           (1)==
           N (winter)
                                   == =
                                 (2)
                                 S (summer)
                                                    (5)=
                                                    Zenith
                                                           =
           (5)  =-=
           E (spring)
                                   =-=
                                 (4)
                                 W (autumn)
                                                    (6)==
                                                    Nadir

   As the yearly hexagram begins with the winter solstice, we
therefore assign the hexagram to the position of North. The
opposite of winter is summer, so the opposite of the yearly
hexagram is placed in the South. The reverse hexagram is still
consistent with original yearly hexagram, and is assigned to
spring, with its opposite being assigned to autumn. Since earth
interacts with all elements, the inner hexagram is considered as
representing earth, with its influence tending toward the zenith in
the first half of the year, and towards the nadir during the second
half. (Figure 5.)

   The daily cycles (Table 16) begin with the yearly hexagram and
its controlling line. The change to the next hexagram after the
yearly hexagram always takes place by changing the controlling
line. Subsequent hexagrams are determined by moving onward
(upward) from the controlling line. When the reverse and
reverse opposite hexagrams come into play, the controlling line

is inverted along with the rest of the hexagram, as shown in the
following example. With the inner, opposite, and opposite inner
hexagrams, the controlling line remains in the same position as
in the basic yearly hexagram, i.e, if line 5 in the yearly, then it is
line 3 in the inner, etc. In the example shown below, the yearly
hexagram is hexagram 37, with line 3 as the controlling line.
The computation for the daily cycles then becomes:

           Stage 8 is a continuation of stage 6, seventy-two days
           later.
           Observe that line 4 is shown as day I and that only the
           top three lines of the hexagram apply here.


Starting the daily cycles
This system of astrology is based on the Commencement of the
year at the winter solstice. If one wishes to be exact, one should
take the length of time between one winter solstice and the
next, divide it by 565, and apply these divisions. The result
would be 565 periods of 24 hours and 1 minute (approx.) in
length. In rare cases this may be useful.
   For practical purposes, however, we will use the 365-day
calculations shown on page 54, and apply them as follows:

When the solsticefalls between midnight and noon         (00.00-[   [.59 hrs)
          Man bo:n in a po~itive year or } Use calendar date
          woman In a negatIve year
          Man bo:n in a ~~gative year or} Use next succeeding
          woman In a posrnve year         calendar date
                                I   I   Background   and Computations
When the solstice falls between noon and midnight    (I 2.00-2   J.59 hrs)
    Man bo~n in a ~~gative year or}         Use calendar date
    woman In a poSItIve year
    Man bor:n in a pos.itive year or}       Use next succeeding
    woman In a neganve year                 calendar date


   Sometimes there will be a gap of a day between one 365-day
cycle and the next. The solstice, however, will fallon this day,
so part of the day will belong to the old year, and part to the new
year. In these cases it is necessary to synthesize a prediction,
taking that for the last day of the old year along with that for
the first day of the new year. Example:
Man (positive year) Winter solstice-December             22; 7.00 hrs.
                                                              Year A.
                          Computation:
First calendar day for daily cycles = December 22. Year A.
One year                            = 365 days.
Therefore last day of cycle           December 21. Year B.
Winter solstice for year B          = December 22; 13.00 hrs.
First calendar day for daily cycles = December 23 (for a man
                                      born in a positive year).
The 'missing' day is December 22 (year B) and the prediction
must be synthesized from the prediction for December 2 I and
that for December 23, the first day of the new astrological year.
This is logical, anyway, since thirteen hours belong to the old
year and eleven hours to the new. In fact, in nearly all cases, the
preceding and succeeding days have an influence on any day in
question, and should be given consideration if the greatest
accuracy is desired or required. As will have been noted, this
synthesizing procedure applies sometimes when the person
concerned was born in a positive year, and sometimes when he
or she was born in a negative year. This procedure should be
considered independent from calendar leap years, even though
sometimes the same years may be involved.
2 I Auspiciousness




The basic and primary concepts of I Ching
The fundamental philosophy of I Ching is truly deep. It covers
all that there is, and there are a number of primary and basic
concepts contained therein which provide the foundation for the
astrology of I Ching. Many commentaries and explanations have
been written about I Ching over the centuries, among them
being those by Confucius. These may be examined by the scholar
who is interested. Here, however, it is sufficient just to say what
the basic concepts are, without going into details. Many the
reader will already know, and most of them are self-explanatory.
 1. The hexagrams are the evolution of the primal forces of Yin
and Yang, as derived from the Universal Creative manifesting
itself.
2. The hexagrams symbolically represent all possible situations
and conditions relating to the human, animal, vegetable and
mineral kingdoms.
3. Basic laws and patterns of the Universal Creative are in, or
are generated by, the Pre-Heaven cycle of trigrams.
4. The basic laws and patterns are made manifest in the universe
in accordance with the Later Heaven cycle of trigrams.
5. Man is an equal partner in the laws governing heaven and
the laws governing earth, while operating in the material
realm.
6. The laws of heaven and the laws of earth are fixed (from man's
point of view). In actuality they are evolving very, very slowly,
but not in a manner perceptible to the vast majority of human
beings.
7. Man has free will: freedom of choice in what he thinks, does
or says.
                                                z   I   Auspiciousness
8. Man has good fortune and success when he works (consciously
or unconsciously) in keeping with the laws of heaven and the
laws of earth.
g. A man does best for himself when he acts selflessly, and in
harmony with the laws of heaven and earth.
10. Karma returns to the originator in Universal Time. It can
and often does override free will in the material realm.
11. Karma is not inevitable. Man can develop himself mentally
and enter the realm of spirit (even if only for brief periods of
time) through refinement and purification. The realm of spirit
supersedes and overrides the material realm in which karma
operates.
12. Man manifests divine will when he works in harmony with
the laws of heaven and the laws of earth.
13. Man progresses spiritually as he further discerns the laws of
heaven and earth, and consciously uses them.
 14•. I Ching is fundamentally a guide for spiritual develop-
ment.
 15. Since the hexagrams represent all conditions and circum-
stances (see 2 above), the hexagrams can, with proper under-
standing and interpretation, be used for any matter a man can
think of.
16. There are no measurable changes in the laws of heaven or
the laws of earth during the lifetime of any individual. Therefore,
the laws affecting an individual at birth are the laws governing
his life.
 17. Man is an equal partner with heaven and earth in the action
ofthe hexagrams. The influences of heaven and earth on the life of
an individual are those forces and laws operating at the moment
of that person's birth. The moment of one's birth is thought of as
part of one's exercise of one's free will. (This can be understood
by the theory of reincarnation, or as the influence of a superior
guiding purpose, whichever belief one may care to hold.)
 18. The influences existing at the time of birth are those of Time,
Space and the relative positions of everything in the universe at
that moment. In this astrology the influence of the sun is given
major consideration, with the moon a poor second, and the rest
of the stars and planets a long way behind.
 19. In the light of the above, the hexagrams can justly be used for
astrological purposes.

                                                                    59
2    I   Auspiciousness
20. The value of using the hexagrams in this way emerges only if
proper rules are established for their astrological determination,
and applied with a sensitive understanding of their meanings.
21. The system described here has been used for many centuries
and has withstood the tests of time, demand and experience, and
it remains foremost, in spite of parallel systems having been
devised.
22. The degree of reliability of this astrology will depend on the
qualifications, spiritual development and experience of the
interpreter.
23. The full import of the horoscope, with all its ramifications,
will only be perceivable by hindsight. The study of past forecasts,
however, will be very useful for improving future forecasts.
24. Only the individual himself can ever know the real truth
about himself and his life. This is a part of his individual freedom.


The elements of the hexagram
The elementary evolution of the universe proceeded, according to
I Ching, from a quiescent Universal Creative desiring to manifest
itself. This desire generated two forces, one positive, called Yang,
and the other negative, called Yin. From these, by a process of
further evolution, all the various dichotomies were produced, and
by the interrelationship and interaction of Yin and Yang in their
limitless combinations, all else in the universe came, or is still to
come, into being. Figure 6 is a simple diagram showing the
evolution of Yin and Yang and then the trigrams.

  Looking vertically above each of the alphabetical letters, one
can see that the evolution consists of various combinations of
Yin and Yang. These combinations are the basic eight trigrams.

h. 3 Yang                                       Ch'ien   Father

   Continuing the evolution for three more stages, one obtains
Figure 7, showing the sixty-four hexagrams. These are found
in the same way that the trigrams were found in Figure 6.
   In any hexagram there are certain favorable and unfavorable
aspects, and some are more so than others:
a. The action of a hexagram is from the bottom to the top.
b. In the hexagram, lines 1 and 2 represent earth; lines 3 and 4,
man; and lines 5 and 6, heaven. Thus, man is an equal partner
with heaven and earth (in the material realm).
c. Lines 2 and 5 are generally the most favorable, and usually
line 5 is more favorable than line 2.
d. Lines 2, 3, 4 and 5 represent the principal action of the
hexagram, in most cases.
e. The ruler of a hexagram is usually line 5, or else a single Yang
or Yin amongst five of the opposite polarity (because of the basic
principle that one rules many). There are, however, a few
exceptions.
f. Lines 1 and 6 are often outside the main action ofthe hexagram,
line 1 reflecting considerations before the activity can commence,
 and line 6 representing a decline after the peak of activity. Also,
they are often unfavorable.
g. In general, the order of favorability is: 5 more than 2, more
than 4, more than 1, more than 5, more than 6.
h. There is a correspondence between lines 1 and 4; lines 2 and
                                                                               61

5; and lines 3 and 6. The correspondence is favorable if the
 upper of the two lines is a Yang and the lower a Yin, i. P.
symbolizing a man leading a woman; it is usually neutral if both
lines are of the same nature. A Yang leading a Yin is more
favorable than if a Yin is uppermo!'t and a Yang below because
a woman leading a man is supposedly an indication of weakness.
i. Even though the hexagrams are formed in the sixth stage of the
evolution of Yin and Yang, they are most frequently considered
as being made up of two trigrams. Both of these points of view are
correct. During any analysis one should bear in mind throughout
whether one is considering the hexagram as a whole, or the
effects of the separate trigrams.
j. In a trigram, the top line represents heaven, the middle line,
man, and the bottom line, earth. Therefore, when analyzing a
hexagram according to its trigrams, one should approach it thus:

pretation of the hexagrams for astrological purposes is the belief
that doubling anything, or the manifestation of doubling, is
especially propitious. Opposites, on the other hand, are viewed
adversely, unless they are obvious counterparts and complement
each other. As examples of propitious doubling one finds that
October 10, 1911 was the date of the birth of the Republic (the
tenth day of the tenth month), and that Lovers' Day is August 8,
the eighth day of the eighth month. ('Eight' is pronounced 'ba.'
'Baba' in Chinese means 'father,' so eight doubled is likewise
'father.') This value attributed to doubling is said to date from
Fu Hsi and his development of the hexagrams, wherein the eight
trigrams are doubled with propitious effects. King Wen (c. 1123
B.C.) was the first to set down the value of doubles in his ex-
positions regarding I Ching. Therefore it is only logical that one
finds doubling considered of value in I Ching astrology.

   The finding of a trigram in an individual's Pre-Heaven or
Later Heaven hexagram that matches the favorable Primeval
(Celestial Stem) Trigram for the year of birth, is believed to mean
that riches, fame, honor, good fortune and love will be forth-
coming in his life. As previously stated, the Pre- Heaven hexagram
governs one's rise in life and the Later Heaven hexagram reflects
the reaping of one's harvest. The Primeval influence is exerted
favorably through the trigrams as shown in Table 17.

   To find out whether one is favored or not, one must refer
back to the Celestial Stem, the capital alphabetical letter obtained

year, and one has the trigram          ==
from Tables 2 and 3, pp. 17-20, e.g. if one was born in an 'A'
                                      in either the upper or lower
position in either one's Pre-Heaven or one's Later Heaven
hexagram, then one is likely to enjoy fame, riches, good fortune,
etc. For instance:
                  Pre-Heaven                 Later Heaven
                     -lL.-


In this example there are three         ==
                                         trigrams, and this state of
affairs would be considered exceptionally favorable.
   Similarly, with the Horary Branches (given by the lower case
alphabetical letters), one's life will be highly favorable if one's
Pre-Heaven or Later Heaven hexagram contains the trigram
corresponding to one's Horary Branch letter in Table 18.

  Among the most favorable Pre-Heaven and Later Heaven
hexagrams are those in which the trigrams are doubled. (Note that
Hexagrams 30 and 58 do not exist as Pre-Heaven hexagrams), i.e.

   A dichotomy exists in the effects of the Celestial Stems and
Horary Branches, just as with other matters in our dualistic
world. Consequently, there are circumstances in which a negative
influence is exerted through the Celestial Stem and Horary
Branch Trigrams. The unfavorable trigram is in each case the
opposite of its counterpart in Table 17 or 18.

The correspondence of months
Check Table 4, pp. 21-2, to determine your month of birth. Check
Table 9, pp. 30-1, or Table 11 p. 33 and see if your natal hexa-
gram matches any of the hexagrams applicable to your month of
birth. If so, it will increase your auspiciousness. For example,
born July 8 (sixth month), natal hexagram is 33 with favaurable
correspondence.


Additional favorable and unfavorable aspects
1. HELP     FROM   OTHERS
When the controlling line has a counterpart of the opposite
polarity (in the Pre-Heaven hexagram only) one will receive
much help from others, from one's leader, one's superiors, and
even from unknown sources. Achievements will only come to
others (whose Pre-Heaven hexagram does not show this corre-
spondence) as a result of their Own efforts.
Examples:
  Help forthcoming    -e-          No outside help      ="=
In the first example, the controlling line is line 5 and a Yang,
with its counterpart, line 2, being a Yin. In the second example,
both the controlling line and its counterpart are Yang lines.

                                                                 67
2    I    Auspiciousness

2.       LEADERSHIP        OF OTHERS
When the Pre-Heaven hexagram has a single Yang or Yin line
as ruler, and this line is the natal controlling line as well, the
person involved will be a leader of others, both professionally and
socially, and, for the most part, will be surrounded by a large
number of people. This is because 'one controls many,' i.e. one
Yang (Yin) controls five Yin (Yang).

3.       EFFECTS    OF THE     MAGNITUDES      OF THE   HEAVENLY     AND
         EARTHLY      NUMBERS
For favorable conditions there should be a degree of rapport
between the heavenly number and the earthly number, already
obtained, when compared with the basic hexagram representation
for the month of birth of the individual under consideration.
The existence or nonexistence of this rapport, and its relative
strength, depend on the ratio of Yaug to Yin lines in the hexa-
gram depicting the month, as compared with the heavenly
number, representing the odd (Yang) aspect, and the earthly
number, representing the even (Yin) aspect. To determine the
favorability or unfavorability, one must compare one's heavenly
and earthly number values with the relevant monthly situation


                      ==-==
elaborated below.

a. December                   Heavy Snow-Winter      Solstice--Eleventh
                              Month
   Here the Yang force is reentering the hexagram from below,
and consequently its influence should not be too weak or it will
not make favorable progress; hence a heavenly number of less
than five is considered unfavorable. On the other hand, if the
Yin value (earthly number) is greater than thirty it is too
strong, overpowering the Yang, and consequently unfavorable.

     Optimum values: Heavenly number: eight to twelve.
                     Earthly number: less than thirty.

   Here the Yang force is considerably stronger; hence to be
favorable the Yang value should be greater.
     Optimum values: Heavenly number: greater than twelve
                     but not more than twenty-five.

c.    February          Spring Begins-Rain   Water-First         Month


   The optimum conditions are when the heavenly number is
about twenty-five and the earthly number about thirty. Con-
ditions are unfavorable to the degree in which the numbers vary
from the foregoing.

   The heavenly number should be greater than twenty-five but
less than thirty, and the earthly number less than thirty, for the
most favorable conditions. If the heavenly number is greater
than thirty it is like having summer weather in the springtime,
and therefore not favorable.

   Note that there is only one Yin line. The Yang lines are
trying to drive it out, therefore the heavenly number should be
greater than twenty-five, and as large as possible, with the Yin
number being very low, for the most favorable conditions.

  The Yin force is beginning to return but is still minimal, so the
earthly number should be low. The heavenly number is most
favorable between twenty-five and thirty-five.

                                                                      69

   Since the Yin lines now predominate over the Yang in the
hexagram, so the heavenly and earthly numbers should be
further apart, with the heavenly number around twenty-five,
and the earthly number between thirty and forty, for the
optimum conditions.

   The heavenly number should be around twenty-two to twenty-
five, and the earthly number around forty, for the most favorable
conditions.

  With the absence of Yang lines in the hexagram, the most
favorable conditions are when the heavenly number is minimal,
and the earthly number between forty and sixty.

As a general guide, it is better for a man to have a large heavenly
number, and for a woman to have a large earthly number. This
factor must, of course, be considered in relation to the other
determining aspects.
   If a man was born in a positive year and his heavenly number
is insufficient (with regard to the month of birth), then his
father 'will die before his mother. If a woman was born in a
                                                2   I   Auspiciousness
negative year and her earthly number is insufficient, then her
mother will die before her father.

4. UNFAVORABLE        YEARS
In the event of a yearly hexagram being the 'opposite' or the
'reverse' of either one's Pre-Heaven or one's Later Heaven
hexagram, that year will be unfavorable.
   The 'opposite' is that hexagram in which every Yang line has
been replaced by a Yin, and every Yin by a Yang, e.g.
             Basic hexagram             Its opposite



  The 'reverse' hexagram is that obtained by turning the basic
hexagram upside-down, e.g.

directional positions, e.g. Fire, Li,     South, Summer. While
each element is dominant in its directional and seasonal positions,
its influence begins to be felt eighteen days before its season

    BASIC FACTORS

    Certain basic factors enter into the development and use of the
    sixty-four hexagrams for making predictions on an astrological
    basis. The background and history of I Ching playa vital role in the
    manner in which thisbookisto be understood. The elements which
    come into play in the use of I Ching itself are equally applicable in
    this branch of its philosophy. This combination of attitudes and
    elements is here distilled into usable, comprehensible predictions.
        One of the principal factors is that I Ching has been used
    throughout its existence as a guide for the conduct of good
    government. In its early days (c.3000---c.1000B.C.) it was used by
    kings and nobles, the only literate people. In 1123 B.C., King
    Wen and the Duke of Chou set I Ching down in writing, with
    some amplifications. Confucius (551-479 B.C.) added to its
    usefulness ·by writing explanatory comments. In 136 B.C.,
    examinations for the filling of government positions at all levels
    were initiated in China. The 'Five Confucian Classics' and I Ching
    were the books from which the examination questions were
    drawn. Many of the interpretations of I Ching consequently
    relate to rules and officials, and one finds this carried over into
    the astrology of I Ching as well. Keeping this in mind, one can
    interpret the statements to fit one's own situation, for, after all,
    governing a country, a family, or oneself have much in common.
    Actions taken in one situation can be paralleled in the others.
    In some instances one must examine the portents closely for
    their applicability to the individual concerned.
       The fundamental basis for interpretation, however, rests on the
    fact that I Ching symbolizes all conditions and circumstances in
    life. This is because the trigrams, each with its wide variety of

                                                                      73
I
3 / The Predictions
meanings, between them embrace all things. Consequently,
detailed consideration of the trigrams composing any hexagram
is vital to the astrology, i.e, what the trigrams represent, which
one is above, whether they are cooperating, whether their
tendency is to rise, fall or separate, what their basic natures are,
what support the lines give each other, etc. From a deep study
and an understanding of these elements, predictions have been
set forth for each line of each hexagram.
    Sometimes, what is written about one of the lines may be
somewhat at variance with the commentary on the hexagram
as a whole, owing to the line's position, the support received,
and/or its strength, etc., demonstrating the fact that nothing,
according to I Ching, is ever all black or all white. There is a
little of the Yin in every Yang, and a little of the Yang in every
Yin. Some favorableness can therefore be expected in every
hexagram, and for every line, however difficult. Similarly, there
will be reason for the exercise of caution, even with the most
favorable of predictions.
    The predictions and commentaries are quite succinct. What
is written is primarily addressed to the superior man, as with the
basic I Ching. The more the commentaries and predictions are
used, the better will be one's understanding of them, and the
nearer one is to becoming a superior man, the more accurate will
be one's interpretations.

Hexagram t      Ch'ien   ==   Creative (Innovatory) Action


The universe has been revolving continuously, and changing
continually, since its inception. Fu Hsi started I Ching with the
hexagram Ch'ien so as to teach mankind to emulate the way of
heaven, to be creative, active and diligent throughout each day,
and to persevere with ceaseless constancy.

COMMENTARY
The Universal Creative, in manifesting itself, first produced the
Yin and the Yang. In three subsequent evolutionary stages it
produced the Yang and seven other trigrams. In six stages it
produced the Yang or Ch'ien hexagram and sixty-three other
hexagrams. The Ch'ien hexagram is composed of two Yang
trigrams or a total of six Yang lines. Yang lines in the first, third
and fifth positions are in their right places. Here we have Yang
lines in the second, fourth and sixth positions as well. Strong lines
in places where weakness should normally prevail can often be
damaging. Creative strength must be properly and wisely directed
for it to be truly propitious ..Since this creativity is throughout the
hexagram, it is considered as stemming from the Primal Source,
and a person born under this hexagram will receive outside help
and support, as well as being exceptionally strong inwardly. He
will be a man of action and creativity. Hence the predictions for
success, fame and riches for those carrying out their intentions
with wisdom.
   It is well known that some paths are smoother than others, and
so it is here. The position of the controlling line sets forth the
favorable and unfavorable conditions. Whether one's path will be
 smooth, rough, or somewhere in between, depends on the position
of the controlling line and how one uses the blessings available
to one through the exercise of one's free will (see also Chapter 2).
    In the lines, mention is made of 'dragons.' The meaning is not
literal but, rather, symbolic of forces, powers and spirits which do
 not only exist here on the surface of the earth, but also in its
 very core, and in the skies, anywhere and everywhere. Related
to man, this signifies the inner force which can transcend time
 and space.
    Those born in the fourth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING        LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line   I   Hidden dragon. Work quietly.

The hidden dragon means that the primeval forces are not
operating out in the open here, implying that one should remain
withdrawn, hiding one's talents and abilities; however one
should be mentally active. These are persons who quietly direct
matters from behind the scenes.

Least auspicious: His level of activity will be quite low and his
living standards poor. Since this is the Ch'ien hexagram, he will
have the wherewithal successfully to overcome and rise above
these conditions.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          No promotion or demotion.
   Business and professional Conditions dormant.
   Ordinary people              Excellent for those leading a quiet

                                activity. Inferior persons will ex-

Line 2 The dragon appears in the field. It is beneficial to meet
the superior man.

 The primal forces are now operating on the surface of the earth,
 symbolizing that this man not only has great talent and ability
 but should demonstrate his talent and worth to the world. Doing
 so will result in successes for him. He is resourceful, and capable
 of working at all levels. Working in cooperation with superiors
 "rill be especially beneficial for him.
 Most auspicious: He will become noble and rich in character,
 wealth and position. He will rise to a high position and his
 services will be sought after by many. He will also have a highly
 favorable personal life.
 Least auspicious: He will attain limited fame, honor and wealth,
.coupled with a modest family life, adequate in all respects.

                                              5   I   The Predictions
J Ching is designed for superior persons, and offers no advice
to inferiors. It does, however, make predictions regarding
them.
   By being cautious yet diligent, a man can avoid mistakes.
Many important matters will confront an individual throughout
his life. The persons indicated here will have a tendency to
procrastinate and be indecisive. They should beware of this.
These persons have ample ability, and their strong traits, if used,
will play an important part, not only in their success but in that
of others dependent on them.
Most auspicious: He will be a noble, honest and learned man,
achieving gains and fame by always being cautious, and by
converting the difficult into the easy, both in his personal and
professional life.
Least auspicious: He will be indecisive, unstable and change-
able, sometimes diligent, sometimes lazy, and often not respecting
others. The potential to improve is there, and, if brought to the
fore, such a person will be able to enhance his circumstances.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will have many assignments
                               and will always be required to be
                               busy. With exceptional care he can
                               avoid mistakes. Chances for pro-
                               motion are remote.
   Business and professional Much activity but little profit.
                               Check and double-check financial
                               position, for safety. Any impetuous-
                               ness will be dangerous.
   Ordinary people             A generally unstable year, without
                               much cooperation.
Line 4 The dragon is wavering. No blame.

Each individual must determine for himself what his course will
be. Whatever course this individual elects to follow will be right
for him. He will have the requisite judgment and experience to
make proper progress or retreat as circumstances dictate. No
blame will occur, no matter what courses he follows.
Most auspicious: He will know when to move and when to stop.
He will also tend to cultivate a highly moral and religious
character. He will be willing to share his knowledge and abilities

                                                                    77
5   I   The Predictions
with others and be of service to them. This will result in many
benefits to him.
Least auspicious: While admiring riches and fame, his in-
decisivenesswill probably keep him from gaining them, except to a
minor degree. Unless he exercises care in all he does, such a person
may become a failure both in his personal and professional life.
In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official         He will have to wait for a position
                              to become vacant, or for pro-
                              motion. Nevertheless he should be
                              constantly active.
  Business and professional The potential for success is avail-
                              able. Rendering service and follow-
                              ing the right courses will be
                              advantageous and fruitful.
  Ordinary people             A propitious year for all activity.
                              Obstacles encountered, generally,
                              will be easily overcome.
Line 5 The dragon flies in the heavens. One should see the
great man.

The achievements of this man will be greater than those of many
others. The primal forces are operating in the sky, and favor all
activity in which such a person may engage, whether it be
mental or physical, spiritual or material. Such an individual will
be progressively successful, and, depending on how much he
exerts himself, his successes can be limitless. He will be con-
tinually blessed by heaven. It is especially of such a person that
the saying 'God helps those who help themselves' truly applies,
even though others, seeing the individual's affluence and
achievements, might be inclined to say that he did not need
God's help. Some scholars say that this controlling line is the
most auspicious of all those in I Ching.
Most auspicious: He will achieve fame and fortune and attain
high positions throughout his life. He will be sought-after and
highly respected, and his services can, and probably will, be used
for the benefit of the nation and the world. His personal life will
be highly favorable.
Least auspicious: He will have a strong desire for fame and
glory, but the results he attains will not be as high as he would

78
                                               3 / The Predictions
like, in that his influence will be primarily at a local level rather
than at a national or international level. He will be successful,
and will have a good family life as well.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Rapid advancements and new posi-
                                tions, favoring the attainment of
                                fame and wealth.
   Business and professional Much activity and profit.
   Ordinary people              He will obtain help from superiors,
                                and will make favorable progress.
Line 6 The highest dragon has regrets.

Since line 6 is the topmost position, the symbolism is that the
dragon has travelled so high that it has become isolated. No
person or thing is independent of all else, so if one strives too
high the results are unsatisfactory and there is cause for regret.
These persons will have such tendencies, but the superior man
heeds this warning, and guides himself accordingly.
Most auspicious: He will be learned and quite influential.
Fortunately, he will have the know-how to remain humble and
to employ caution. This will enable him to attain modest fame
and fortune, and to retain it.
Least auspicious: He will be arrogant and ostentatious, and will
have a generally troublesome and unfavorable life. Ho may die
young.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         Demotion Or retirement is likely.
   Business and professional If he is too hard in his dealings and
                               is obstinate, he will run into many
                               difficulties.
   Ordinary people             He can expect moderate difficulty
                               throughout the entire year.

Hexagram        2   K'zm   ==     Receptiveness (Responsiveness)


SIMPLE       TRANSLATION          OF TEXT
Receptiveness. Sublime success. The firmness of a mare ad-
vantageous. If the superior man takes the initiative he goes
astray, but if he follows he finds guidance. Favorable friends will
be found in the south and west, but those in the north and east
will be lost. Gentle persistence leads to good fortune.

COMMENTARY
One immediately notes a similarity to the text of the Ch'ien
hexagram. This is because the Yin and the Yang, the Receptive
and the Creative, are equal, and complement each other rather
than oppose. It is true that their basic characteristics are very
different, but there is no such thing as only one path to a particular
goal, whether it be spiritual development, fame, fortune, riches,
a long life, happiness, or whatever. The symbol for Yin is the
earth, Therefore, this person should be like the earth, i.e,
strong, receptive, responsive, and, above all, inwardly correct.
Whenever the earth is correct inwardly it is productive externally,
useful, beneficial, and a thing of beauty, It is responsive to the
laws of heaven, and works to consummate what is required of it,
without external display or complaint. Those born here should

                                                  ;) / The Predictions
try to emulate the earth. It is of such a person that it can be said,
'He never seems to do anything yet he always gets results.'
Another attribute of these persons is that, generally, they never
let you know what they are thinking.
   Since the predominant quality here is receptiveness, like the
nature of a mare, these persons will fare best if they let others do
the leading. The south and west are the directions in which there
are many people, and the places where things are brought to
fruition. The north and east are the directions from which
orders emanate. Here, the north and east are to be avoided, but
following established paths will lead to good fortune. This
hexagram is expecially favorable for women. One born under
this hexagram will be kind, gentle, virtuous, and will marry a
good man, with whom she can rear a fine family and have a good
life.
   Those born in the tenth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING        LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM      TO TOP)
Line   I   With the coming of frost, winter is not far behind.

This is the lowest position in the earth, and indicates the begin-
ning of growth. This person will face many quandaries in life,
and will have trouble learning how to make proper decisions. He
also will have to learn many lessons regarding patience and the
length of time it takes for seeds (ideas or actions) to mature, just
as there is a natural interval between the first frost and winter.
Care, caution, and the making of detailed observations will then
become routine.
Most auspicious: This person will be active and studious in
childhood and through his school years. He will probably stand
high in his class, which will help him in his subsequent work or
position in life, and he will gain fame and fortune relatively
early. This line is especially auspicious for a child born in a
positive month.
Least auspicious: He will have a tendency not to follow an
accepted or proper way of life. He will take advantage of people,
especially through confidences, and will be easily angered and
highly susceptible to flattery. He is likely to be artful or villainous,
and more likely to be notorious than famous.
In yearly hexagram:
                                                                     81

                             gossip is likely. Be very careful.
   Business and professional Government policies, competition,
                             and professional jealousies will
                             make this a difficult year.
   Ordinary people           Be careful of the troubles stemming
                             from the jealousies of others.
Line 2 Strong, broad and straight in capacity and ability.
Affairs prosper, even though no action may be taken.

The second line is the ruler of this hexagram and hence holds
within it all the most favorable portents. This person will be
highly developed spiritually, and will carry out the will of heaven
rather than his own will. Working thus, his every thought and
action will be furthered and blessed by heaven, as long as he
does not try to override heaven's will.
Most auspicious: He will be a noble, broadminded and capable
person, attaining a high position in whatever work he chooses.
He may serve some time in the government, and will be very
influential. His personal and professional life will be worthy of
emulation by others
Least auspicious: He will be an honest man, respected by his
peers, and will be well known locally. He will have a reasonably
good life, however he will be frequently restless.

glory and recognition. Immediate successes are not to be expected,
but ultimate success will be achieved.

Humility, perseverance and patience are the qualities which will
achieve the greatest success, under this controlling line, when
these are coupled with wisdom. Those especially favored will
have these qualities. Others born under this hexagram will
learn to acquire them to a greater or lesser degree.

perhaps even, by dint of especial effort, become famous and
achieve wealth at various times in his life.

have mediocre achievements.

                              concentrates.
Line 4 Calmness. No blame. No praise.

Troublesome conditions seem imminent. By handling them
quietly and with reserve, they can be overcome or avoided. The
judicious exercise of wisdom and reserve produces neither blame
nor praise for the results achieved. These persons will be diligent
and responsible, and will be capable of becoming outstanding
executives. Since many difficulties will be encountered, great
achievements are not presaged.
Most auspicious: He will attain a high and influential position,
but will not attain renown. His successes will be positive but
limited in scope. He will have a generally favorable life.
Least auspicious: This person will be a loyal, honest, sincere
and reliable individual. He will probably have a moderate or
low income. His life also will be quite favorable.
In yearly hexagram:

pure, inwardly strong, and will express humility, even when
richly endowed mentally, physically and spiritually. They will
possess an inner beauty, nurtured by an inherently noble spirit.
That which they are inwardly will come into being and reach
fruition outwardly, hence supreme good fortune can be expected.
Most auspicious: He will be noble, virtuous, helpful and
beneficial to others, both professionally and personally, and all
possible good will be his for the taking.
Least auspicious: He will be revered yet modest, achieving
better than average results, and wealth as well, along with a
favorable reputation and a good life.

                               centrates.
Line 6 Contending- with a true dragon results in black and
yellow blood.

In this sixth position, the Yin force has run to an extreme, and
if it tries to lead and take the place of a creative dragon (see the
explanation of 'dragon' under hexagram 1), the result will be
bloodshed and injury. Yin activity should remain receptive and
responsive, no matter how high it rises. A person born with this
controlling line will be inclined to lead, but if he notes the
warnings given and guides himself appropriately, even though it
is likely to be difficult, he can be successful and avoid serious
injury. Such a person may never have peaceful enterprises or
great happiness, yet by virtue of possessing qualities inherent in
the hexagram he will be able to attain a full and rewarding life.
Most auspicious: He will achieve a high position, but unless he
exercises humility constantly he will become arrogant, always
blaming others for mishaps or mistakes, and eventually losing aU
he has gained.
Least auspicious: He will become a man of bad character,
boastful, ostentatious, unreliable, and changeable in thought and
action; he will have many hardships.

5   I   The Predictions
The kind of person depicted here is a superior man who knows
what to do and how to do it with persistence and constancy. These
individuals will bring new ideas into being, help whatever is
small to grow big, and do so using proper methods and principles.
This type of leadership, which is difficult to exercise, is pro-
ductive of success, and will result in benefits, riches and fame.
As a general guide, action will initiate inspiration.
   Those born in the sixth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING         LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line    IThe way of righteousness must be pursued,           despite
uncertainties and difficulties at the beginning.

The actions and character demanded of this person are of the
highest quality and strength. Very few will be able to meet
these arduous demands. The beginning of anything holds the
seed of all that is to follow. What happens at the beginning will
largely determine the degree of success or failure later. Life will
not be easy for those with this controlling line. Fortunately, these
persons are innately endowed with the qualities necessary for
coping with whatever faces them.
Most auspicious: He will achieve greatness in his position or
enterprise, but this will be precarious. While results will be
attained, nothing will be easy, either in his personal or his
professional life.
Least auspicious: Basically, he will be an honorable man, but
likely to be quite suspicious of others and frequently indecisive,
resulting in few or no achievements.
In yearly hexagram:

This man has advanced a step, but there are still many difficulties
and uncertainties. The man neither knows nor recognizes the
right course to pursue, at the beginning of the line, and wanders
this way and that in his efforts to find the correct path. He seems
to make no progress. The situation appears quite adverse, like
that of a man wooing a maiden only to find she has lost her veil,
the symbol of purity and correctness. The truth is, however, that
she has merely been robbed of something which was beyond her
control. Thus the situation looks dire, but is not in reality what it
 seems on the surface. In due course the man will see things for
 what they are, and he will then be able to proceed without
 encountering obstacles. These individuals will have many trials
 and tribulations in early life, but through diligent and persistent
 effort they will eventually find the right and successful way.
 Most auspicious: He will experience much solitude and will
 receive no help in the early part of his life. Later, the situation
 will reverse itself. He will achieve fame on a local basis, and
 modest riches. The latter part of his life will be happy.
 Least auspicious: He will be too ambitious, and will not wait for
 the right time to act. This impatience and rashness will be
 resented, so he will run into much opposition and achieve but
 little. This man's morals may also be questionable.

                                 and wise manner, and will advance

     Business and professional A troublesome year, with growth
                                 stagnating.
     Ordinary people             For the most auspicious: He is
                                 likely to marry this year or increase
                                 the size of his family. For the
                                 least auspicious: Many hardships,
                                 and possible litigation.
 Line J When pursuing a deer in the forest, without a guide, a
 hunter is likely to find himself lost. The superior man discerns
 the situation and desists from going forward, since so doing
 would lead to needless troubles.

This line shows that by not acting properly one can get into
difficulties. Great care and caution are suggested.
3 / The Predictions
   In a general way, there are four types of individuals, namely,
(1) the wise and energetic, (2) the wise and lazy, (3) the foolish
and lazy, and (4) the foolish and energetic. It is of these last that
one must be wary, and they, for themselves, must exercise great
care in order to be successful. It is this fourth type that is
symbolized here, with the warning that they should take their
time and become wise before (wrongly) releasing the energy they
possess, i.e, through diligence and care to advance from category
(4) to category (1). The potential is there. It can be worked on,
and some of these persons will do so.
Most auspicious: He will be a superior person, knowing when
and how to act at all times, thereby achieving successes. Also,
acting thus he will avert troubles.
Least auspicious: He will move from place to place searching
for the right work and associates, but never truly finding them.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He is likely to be accused of cor-
                               ruption. A troublesome year.
   Business and professional He is likely to suffer from insults
                               and the erroneous thinking of
                               others.
   Ordinary people             Any deviations from the norm
                               could result in the individual being
                               arrested and jailed.
Line 4 Indecisive, trotting to andfro, he waits for marriage. Sub-
sequently, every action will prosper and good fortune will prevail.

One should seek to associate with a wise and clever man, or to
join an enterprise in a propitious situation. Through thus uniting,
one will be able to overcome one's difficulties and have one's
wishes fulfilled.
   The fourth line of a hexagram is the higher position of man,
and one born under this line should normally be firm, positive,
persevering and correct. The Yin line here is weak and not in
the proper place, hence at the start this man is indecisive, and
hesitates. In this situation it is right that he do so, until he finds
the right person or situation to unite with (symbolized by the
marriage). Once this is done he will be working in harmony with
the will of heaven, because of the Yang line immediately above,
and good fortune and success will then be attained.

                                              3 / The Predictions
Most auspicious: This man's early life will be spent in the
search for an association with one of superior talents. Eventually
he will meet a person in an authoritative position who will
recognize his merits and appreciate him. He will then rise to a
high position and achieve success.
Least auspicious: He may remain indecisive through timidity
and lack of courage, never becoming independent. He will have a
tendency to wander, in both his private and his public life, even
though superior persons may try to help him.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         Promotion and fame is likely.
   Business and professional Advancement and profits are to be
                               expected.
   Ordinary people             A generally favorable year, pro-
                               vided he receives help from friends.
Line 5 Nourishing is difficult. Doing small things brings good
fortune, but great enterprises should be avoided.

This man's character is not sufficiently expansive to bring great
results from his actions. This is the ruling line of the hexagram,
which is normally an indication of auspiciousness. Unfortunately,
the individual symbolized here is still relatively weak in overall
growth, especially in intelligence and character. He will have
good potential for growth, but for the most part will lack the
experience to be able to cope with, and successfully overcome,
major difficulties. Consequently, if he stays within proper limits
for himself he can be successful to a modest degree. On the
other hand, if he becomes pushful and tries to force results in
other than small matters, he will experience misfortune.
Most auspicious: He will know how to cooperate with others, as
well as how to act independently. He will achieve some small
successes, local fame, and some wealth.
Least auspicious: He may be over ambitious without possessing
adequate experience or making necessary preparations, and as
a result meet with misfortune, unless through diligence he
becomes wise enough to change his ways and character.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         Small gains can be expected.
   Business and professional Take small steps only, and with
                               care.

                                                                89
5    I   The Predictions
     Ordinary people             Avoid expansiveness of any sort,
                                 and matters will go well.
Line 6       Horse and chariot part. Blood and tears flow.

This line holds little opportunity for further advancement; hence
there is considerable consternation and concern.
   Symbolically, this man has advanced too far, without being
adequately prepared; it is like going into battle with poor
equipment so that one's horses become separated from the
chariot. Naturally, blood and tears will flow. These conditions
are paralleled in this man's life. He should never go so far in any
one direction that there are no alternative possibilities, or blood
and tears will ensue. A person born with this controlling line will
probably have a very unfavorable life, unless taught the right
path, and unless, through his personal efforts and will, he manages
to overcome the power of fate.
Most auspicious: Even the most auspicious omens are not good.
It will be a life of hardships and difficulties, with constant
dilemmas as to when and how best to act. No fame, and little
fortune, is indicated.
Least auspicious: He will have a poor marriage and family life,
and may suffer a disabling injury and/or imprisonment.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          The probability of malicious gossip,
                                investigations, and false reports,
                                demands that extreme care be
                                exercised.
   Business and professional Slanderous competition will be
                                damaging.
   Ordinary people .            Beware of possible disaster. Make
                                sure that you are well insured.
                                You, or one of your parents, may
                                die this year.

Hexagram 4        Meng   =-   Immaturity


SIMPLE   TRANSLATION       OF TEXT
Youthfulness, despite its lack of wisdom, can still achieve success.
The teacher does not seek the tyro, but when sought and
questioned, answers fully. If the student importunes, no further
information is given. Correctness promotes success.

COMMENTARY
This hexagram depicts a spring at the foot of the mountain, and
symbolizes uncultured youth. The spring shows the potential of
ever increasing nourishment, and the mountain signifies the
heights that can be attained. The superior man develops his
worth with every step he takes in life.
   To understand I Ching and its guidance, one must remember
that it is based on the theory of reincarnation or a divine plan
whereby all people do not come into this world equal in mental
and physical endowments. Each is different, each is at a particular
level, each has his own experiences to encounter and each has
certain lessons to learn. Those born with Meng as their ruling
hexagram are not stupid, but merely lacking in certain areas of
experience and wisdom, which they must seek out. Their
immaturity will be overcome through proper learning and
:; I   The Predictions
learning methods. Continuing effort will secure success. Such
persons' lives will be far from dull, and more than likely very
interesting.
   ThosE'born in the eighth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING         LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line I To cultivate maturity in a youth it is advisable to apply
discipline, but never more than is necessary, while removing the
fetters of his mind.

A teacher conducting the training of a youth is depicted here.
Thus two interpretations are possible, i.e. one for the teacher and
another for the student. Since the hexagram as a whole is con-
cerned with immaturity, this line will generally relate to the
inexperienced person. An individual born with this hexagram
and controlling line will find himself surrounded by limitations,
visible and invisible. His progress will be determined by how
quickly he learns his lessons. Since the line is a Yin, led by a
Yang in the second position, his chances for success are quite
good.
Most auspicious: He will be close to people in high positions.
He will cultivate a just and moral character and be blessed. He
also has the potential to become rich or famous, or both.
Least auspicious: He will be a good, useful and loyal citizen,
with a better than average life.
 In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will probably be assigned to a
                               position involving education or law

                               possibility.
 Line 2 Tolerating initial weaknesses brings good fortune. Sons
 will be capable of taking charge of the household.

Whatever one's position in life may be, it will involve the leading
of others to a greater or lesser degree. This person will be kindly
and considerate, as symbolized by 'tolerating weaknesses.' He
                                              5   I   The Predictions
will also know how to treat women, and will find himself a good
wife, since he is qualified to take charge of the household. All in
all, this reflects inner strength and outer reserve. Whatever such
a person undertakes will be productive and beneficial. His life
should be favorable, whatever activities he pursues.
Most auspicious: He will be a wise, broadminded person, kind
and considerate, putting others before himself. He will be loyal to
his family, and patriotic, and will have a highly satisfactory life.
Least auspicious: He will have an average life, with a good
wife and family, and good partners and/or friends.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           His position will be stable, and he
                                 will have fruitful achievements.

                                 example to others.
   Ordinary people               Whatever he concentrates on will
                                 be accomplished. Also, he may get
                                 married or increase the size of his
                                 family.
Line)      Do not marry a maiden who, on seeing a wealthy man,
loses control of herself. Nothing advantageous.

Just as many women will give up their honor in the hope of
catching !i wealthy man, so, likewise, immature men may sell
their souls in the hope of acquiring quick gains. One is warned
against such surreptitious conduct, since what is not rightfully
and dutifully earned will not remain in one's possession. Persons
with this controlling line will have a tendency towards reckless-
ness, while still lacking in wisdom, experience and learning.
Unless corrective measures are taken, such actions will bring no
favorable advantage to such a person.
Most auspicious: He will be learned, but inclined to use his
knowledge for selfish purposes only. There will be periods of
gain and loss throughout his life, in both the personal and
professional realms. A woman will quite likely become an
accomplished mistress.
Least auspicious: He will be a person of bad character, inclined
to hurt people behind their backs. He will have many hardships
in life and no worthy accomplishments.

  Ordinary people           He should maintain calm and
                            quietude. He may become in-

                            troubles through an excessive use
                            of alcohol.
Line 4 Opinionatedness, .stubbornness, and immaturity bring
humiliation.

This line shows the student enmeshed in erroneous thinking,
and the teacher having no recourse but to leave him alone to
suffer humiliation, in order to bring him to his senses.
   Many people are born, or become, impractical in thought and
action, and, through obstinacy, immaturity, opinionatedness or
deluded imagination, demand to follow their own course despite
the propitious guidance of others. Often, friends, teachers and
superiors have no recourse but to leave such an individual alone
to suffer from his self-generated folly, until remorse sets in and
he once again desires to follow the right path. There are appar-
ently several important lessons that these persons are destined to
have to learn in their lives, lessons which others have already
learned. What befalls these individuals is right for them at
this particular stage of their evolution, for each is serving a
divine pW"pose,despite the difficulties in which they find them-
selves.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of talent and ability, but
these qualities will not be recognized, so he will either tend to
withdraw within himself, or go and live in seclusion. His attain-
ments will only be small.
Least auspicious: He will have but few friends, being of a
difficult nature, and having a tendency to show off. He will be a
wastrel, and will probably not marry or have children.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He can expect no cooperation from

Line 5 Childlike innocence brings good fortune.

Knowing how to trust one's teacher, and accepting what he says,
brings success.
   When, having selected a qualified teacher, a man subordinates
himself to his instructor, accepting his teachings and guidance
in good faith, he will certainly be helped further, and will
achieve success by utilizing what he has learned. In life. an
ardent seeker of knowledge will usually be able to find that
which he needs to know for the next step in his progress. He will
obtain it from another person, or from written material, or it
will come to him intuitively. Those born under this line will also
know what to accept, and how to put it to practical use. Many of
these people will be researchers in their chosen field, scientists,
inventors or innovators.
Most auspicious: He will be clever and intelligent from child-
hood, and will be helped by parents, relations, teachers and
friends. He will become quite successful in his profession, and
will have a good personal life.

Hexagram     5   Hsu.   ==   Waiting


SIMPLE     TRANSLATION       OF TEXT
Confident, joyous, deliberate waiting. Perseverance in righteous
action brings success.

COMMENTARY
In life, there are right times to advance, right times to retreat,
and right times to wait. Here, the proper time and way to wait
are shown, along with the results which can be expected from
the various phases of such a course. Proper waiting is a sign of
strength and not of weakness. It reflects confidence and patience,
with an inner knowledge that one's goal will be attained. Rare
is the person who is not faced with doubts while waiting in times
of difficulty. The persons symbolized here will be at ease in
any circumstances, knowing that they are in control through
their inner correctness, and that sooner or later they will
achieve success. They will have ordered and generally happy
lives.
   Those born in the eighth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING        LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line   I Remain firm, following that which you know to be
right, and wait on the outskirts.

There are many different types of individual in this world,
each of which can do some things better than any other type.
This man should be in a supporting role, letting others lead. He
should let someone else be the salesman, while he quietly waits
on the sidelines, lending guidance and support. Each member is
an equally valuable part of the team. This is the kind of activity
that persons with this controlling line should pursue, no matter
what career they elect to follow. In general, more success will

be achieved by working as part of a group than by operating
independently.
Most auspicious: He will be an honest and incorruptible
official in local government or business. He will exert influence,
mainly from behind the scenes, and will achieve modest success.
Least auspicious: He will be a mild-mannered,            mediocre
person, living a rather uneventful life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He will keep his present position,
                              with no promotion this year.

   Ordinary people            There will be few or no difficulties
                              of note, except for those persons
                              who are accident-prone.
Line 2 Waiting on the sand by a stream. There is some injurious
gossip, but in the end good fortune.

In ancient times, when I Ching came into being, there were no
bridges, so to cross a stream one waited on the bank, either for a
boat, or for the water to subside. Water symbolizes danger. One
standing on the sand by a stream is very near the water (danger),
and may be overcome by it if it suddenly rises and surges in his
direction. Crossing the water symbolizes the carrying out of some
great enterprise. Therefore, those depicted here are desirous of
achieving progress, and are willing to face the dangers that their
prospective enterprise will entail. Others, less visionary and
daring, will talk adversely about the projects, which may do them
some temporary harm, but this will not stall the activity and in
the end good fortune will ensue. Persons with this controlling
line are quiet individuals who make careful plans with vision, and
execute them with daring. Their lives will be centered around
these dominant characteristics.
Most auspicious: Good omens will prevail throughout his life
and he will become honored awl well known.
Least auspicious: He will he a happy-go-lucky wanderer. and iI
persuasive talker, possibly a confidence trickster. His later yelll"';
will be more stable and personally beneficial.

                             for a group of people (but hampered
                             by some gossip).
  Business and professional He will be daring, and successful in
                             overcoming difficulties, which will
                             be numerous.
  Ordinary people            Those who are generous and have
                             forgiving natures will have no
                             troubles. Forceful individuals will
                             face disputes and lawsuits, but can
                             win if the right courses are followed.
Line)   VVaiting in the mud (next to a stream) invites the
approach of injury and evil.

The persons symbolized here are similar to those born under line
2, but not so wise or clever. They want to be daring and accom-
plish major enterprises (crossing the water), but while waiting
they are standing in the mud. Anyone so doing will be limited in
the speed with which he can take action and the directions in
which he can move. An enemy can easily catch and harm one so
mired. This is most evident in the animal kingdom, where
predators stalk their prey at watering-places. Hence these
persons are not wise and knowledgeable, as they ought to be for
the things they are trying to accomplish. Since I Ching is a guide
not a book of facts, such persons can circumvent this portent by
learning wisdom and gathering wise persons about them, or by
setting their sights on less difficult goals than those originally
selected. (Read also what is written under line 2.)
Most auspicious: He will attain some wealth and fame, but will
he worried and melancholy much of the time.
Least auspicious: He will be obstinate, headstrong and hard-
hearted. He will not listen to good advice, but will find reckless-
ness, and vain and foolish talk pleasing. He will have no real
achievements in life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         Demotion or grief is likely.
   Business and professional He will suffer insults and economic
                              injury.
   Ordinary people             He may be burgled, or suffer injury
                              on a journey.
Line 4 Waiting in a pit amidst blood.

                                                                  99
::;I   The Predictions
H.emembering that I Ching was developed in ancient times, one
can see the image here is of one who has fallen into a pit or trap
along his course. No action is possible. He can neither advance
nor retreat. The person is either injured himself, or in the midst
of blood from an injury to someone, or something, else. The
persons born under this line are unfortunate individuals, who,
no matter what they try and do, never manage to achieve much
success. Here again though, the adversity of fate can be overcome
through proper self-development. If the path of self-improvement
is not attempted, then such persons should stand firm in what is
right and let fate take its course. In the end, all will be released
from the pit.
Most auspicious: He will be a talented and upright person, who
will learn how to avoid trouble, but will face severe difficulties in
both his personal and professional life.
Least auspicious: He will leave home early in life, and there is a
possibility that his parents may die during his childhood. He
will have only a poor education, and will be a wanderer, per-
forming menial tasks.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         Wise persons, noting the situation,
                               will avoid demotion.
   Business and professional Those having the backing and
                               support of others win have some of
                               their wishes fulfilled.
   Ordinary people             This year will be unfavorable, to a
                               greater or lesser degree. He should
                               seek cooperation and assistance
                               from friends to achieve success.
Line 5 Waiting at the banquet. Perseverance brings good
fortune.

The feast has been prepared, and there is an abundance of all
things available for the taking. One can relax and enjoy the
bounty available to one. Perseverance, as used here, means
knowing when and how to aet propitiously. There is a right time
at a banquet to eat certain foods, and these persons win know
all that they need to know, and will do everything that needs to
be done, wherever they find themselves. The result will be that
they will have an abundance available to them, as at a banquet.

These persons are blessed by heaven.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of noble character, occupying
a high position. He will carry out his duties and responsibilities
well, and will be highly respected. He will exercise good judgment
at all times. There will be no hardships in his life.
Least auspicious: He will attain only a modest position pro-
fessionally, but will have a good family life and no major
problems.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will gain promotion and an
                               increase in salary.
   Business and professional He will be noticed, and will make
                               profits.
   Ordinary people             He will make profits and life will
                               be good. He may marry, or increase
                               the size of his family.
Line 6 Waiting in a cavern. Three unexpected guests arrive.
Honor them. There will be good fortune in the end.

Here at the top of the trigram K'an, meaning danger, the man
represented seems to have tried every possible way to overcome
the danger, without success, and has withdrawn within himself.
Everything seems to have been in vain, and no way out is in
sight. Suddenly, three unexpected guests arrive; (these may
represent persons or ideas). He asks himself if they are friends
or enemies. The advice is to honor them, and they will reciprocate
by either showing, or helping him to find, a way out of his
difficulties and the path to success. Often, thoughts or people
strange to us, regarding which we have doubts, later prove to be
our salvation. Those persons born under this line are daring and
enterprising individuals, who are willing to try almost any means
of achieving success. By their continued activity, new inspirations
arise. Sometimes, however, they must temporarily relax in order
to let new thoughts enter. When these do, if they are respected
and explored, regardless of how strange they may seem at the
time, then difficulties will be overcome.
Most auspicious: He will become an eminent scholar or civic
leader. He will be very ambitious early in life, but will quieten
down appreciably later. He may become a recluse in his senior
years.
                                                                  101

Least auspicious: He will be humble and modest, giving and
receiving help, and in general will avoid troubles. He will have
a modest, uneventful life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He is likely to be transferred to a
                             position of importance. Beware of
                              misrepresentation.

                             tion and profits. Scholars may
                              attain national prominence.
   Ordi.nary people           This can be a very good year, if care
                              and caution are exercised. Im-
                             prudent persons may suffer degra-
                              dation, or death.
KEYNOTES
1. Waiting for or avoiding action is better than impulsiveness.
2. Take note of signs, and know when you are impeded.
3. Whenever action is bogged down, beware of encroaching
dangers.
4. When progress is halted, retreat and regroup.
5. Determination and persistence bring success.
6. Employ wisdom constantly, since nothing ever has a final
ending.

CONDENSATIONS             FOR   DAILY   CYCLES
1.  Some danger may be near. Keep outside its imminent sphere.
Do not do anything out of the ordinary.
2. Watch what is taking place without participating in it. Then
strike at the right time.
3. It is as if one were stuck in mud, with danger near. Exercise
extreme care.
4. There is still danger near. Let matters take their own course.
5. Success is certain, so you can relax and wait. R.etain the
determination to act when the time is ripe.
6. Your creative strength and wisdom come to the fore from
within yourself. Put your trust in your intuition.


Hexagram       6   Sung    ==     Conflict


1052
                                               3   I   The Predictions
SIMPLE     TRANSLATION     OF TEXT
In conflict, righteousness and sincerity are not sufficient by
themselves. Plans should be made carefully before any enterprise
is begun. If conflict develops later, use caution, and do not force
matters to their ultimate conclusion, nor force the advancement
of any enterprise.

COMMENTARY
In this hexagram, Ch'ien, strength, is in the outer or external
position, over K'an, cunning, within. External strength leading
internal cunning is certain to result in conflict, unless channelled
and guided correctly. The strength without tends to make
individuals with this natal hexagram persons of great external
drive and forcefulness, to which most people react unfavorably.
In the vast majority of cases it would be better for them to halt
half way, rather than try and take matters forcibly to an ultimate
conclusion, whereby misfortune would be likely as a result of the
antagonisms generated. The wisdom needed by such persons
should be sought from those of kingly character. By following
their advice, good results can be expected. If such help is not
available, it would be best for these persons to forgo any major
enterprises. Fundamentally, persons born under this hexagram
have some strong inner conflict to overcome before their external
actions will be productive of major success.
   Those born in the second month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line   I Do not press disputes through to the end. If left alone
they will end propitiously.

Pressing a conflict through to the end makes enemies, which will
quite likely result in further difficulties. Ways should be found
to solve problems quickly, without either side losing face. The
advice for individuals with this controlling line is to become
aware of their basic traits, and use them to become negotiators
rather than domineering tyrants, into which they could easily
degenerate. Remember too that problems often solve themselves
when left alone. Keep striving for ever greater wisdom.
Most auspicious: He will be intelligent, wise, quick thinking,
open-minded and considerate. He will be aware of changes in
5   I   The Predictions
affairs in advance, and for the most part will avoid trouble and
difficulties. He is likely to be an orator, historian, counsellor or
writer, and his life, in general, will be beneficial and interesting.
Least auspicious: He will be unable to envisage changes and
situations correctly, and hence will have but few achievements.
In general, he will not be sufficiently knowledgeable or per-
sistent, in either his personal or professional life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be injured by defamation
                                or misrepresentation. In the end,
                                the situation will clear up by
                                itself.
   Business and professional As above.
   Ordinary people               He will be bothered by lawsuits and
                                misrepresentations, but these will
                                finally be settled in his favor. A
                                chronic illness may be miraculously
                                cured, or, for the least auspicious,
                                death may occur.
Line 2 Unequal conflict cannot be resolved. Retreat. Numerous
family members and friends will benefit from such a course.

A man of good common sense and practicality is depicted here.
It is a wise course, when faced by a superior enemy or cir-
cumstance, to retreat and reformulate plans, adopting reasonable
ways rather than dogmatically pressing forward without hope of
victory. The lower trigram is representative of water, which does
not force its way when impeded but quietly builds up until it
overcomes its obstacle. Retreat is not surrender. It is taking
advantage of time and space in order to renew the struggle
subsequently with better hope of success.
Most auspicious: He may become a respected official, able to
withstand defamation and denunciation, or he may be sufficiently
rich to be able to withdraw into seclusion, thereby avoiding
troubles.
Least auspicious: He will not like others getting ahead of him
and leaving him in second place. He will be pushful, and will
encounter difficulties in striving for advancement, but inwardly
he will know the value of retreat, and will occasionally use it,
reluctantly, in order to maintain a stable life.
                                               5   I   The Predictions
In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official           He will probably have an increase
                               in salary.
   Business and professional Conservatism is the keynote. Corn-
                               petitiveness on a large scale is to be
                                avoided.
   Ordinary people.             A stable and quiet year for most.
                               Some may face lawsuits, or have to
                               escape from a difficult situation.
Line}      Nourishing oneself on tried and true methods. Danger at
first, but in the end good fortune. Keep in the background, even
though elements try to force one deeper into the situation.

The third line is the lower position of man, and in this hexagram
the symbolism is predominantly indicative of character building.
This man has found something of great value to him personally,
and he tries to make a complete conversion at once. He is not
sucoessful because the old weeds have not been fully eradicated,
but through persistence he will achieve his goal in the end. In
such circumstances, while undergoing change, it is best to keep
in the background, even though there may be external pressure
for advancement. In life, such a person will probably branch out
into a new field or career foreign to his rearing or his parents'
endeavors, and will experience difficulties in the early years but
will achieve his goals later in life.
Most auspicious: For the first half of his life he is likely to be
under the protection and guidance of his parents, grandparents or
close friends of the family. His success in nearly everything will
come with the aid of outside support.
Least auspicious: He will receive little or no outside support,
but through diligent study and constancy he will be able to
overcome the numerous difficulties he will encounter. Regret-
tably, he will not rise very high in life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will stay on in his position,
                               without difficulty.
   Business and professional An ordinary year, with little
                               fluctuation.

3   I   The Predictions
retreats and carries out divine will. This change in attitude
brings good fortune.

 This man is inclined to carryon a contlict and to try and improve
 his situation. This is contrary to divine will, so he has to retreat,
 attain inner peace, and then follow the course he intuitively
 knows to be right for him. The striving comes from being am-
 bitious and trying to get as far ahead as possible, possibly beyond
 where he has earned a right to be. This person should remember
 that nothing is useless in the hands of the Creator, and that each
 human being serves a purpose, wherever he is and whatever he
 is doing. Riches, fame and fortune are not ends in themselves but
 are only valuable for the uses to which they are put. Man is but
 a custodian. Usefulness is demanded here. When a career of
 usefulness is selected and followed, this man will find even
greater inner peace, and will have good fortune.
Most auspicious: He will be a consistent, persevering, merciful
person, following and promoting peaceful paths for himself and
his country, with good results.
Least auspicious: He will be too ambitious, and will offend
people easily. He will not know how to control himself inwardly,
and so will not have good fortune or a peaceful life.
In yearly hexagram:

                                will result in success.
    Ordinary people             If he reforms from error and resorts
                                to doing good deeds, he will be free
                                from troubles and will have a
                                peaceful and satisfying year, other-
                                wise he will have difficulties.
Line 5 Bringing conflicts before a qualified arbiter results in
supreme good fortune.

This line is very favorable in all aspects, and reflects a wise
person endowed with good judgment, who knows the right
course to take in all situations and circumstances. Consequently,
he will have many highly favorable achievements. He will also
be energetic, persistent and consistent in all that he undertakes.

His actions will be worthy of emulation by others.
Most auspicious: He will be learned and practical. He will have
many advancements in life, and will attain a high position from
which he will exert great influence.
Least auspicious: With the occasional help of a qualified
arbiter he will follow the right courses, and will achieve a very
favorable local position and influence.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will achieve a major advance-
                               ment or promotion.
   Business and professional He will win unusual honors and
                               success.
   Ordinary people             Strong desires will materialize.
Line 6 Contentions without end. Even rewards earned three
times will be taken away.

This is the topmost position in the cycle of contention and
conflict, symbolizing that conflict has been carried on to victory
and rewards have been received. This peace, however, does not
last, because the right way in which to terminate the conflict
was not found. The top men in the professions, industry and
business are symbolized here, those who have attained their
goals through persistence and ruthlessness. Such people are
dynamic, but they do not realize that what is won by force can
be taken away by force, and so they are involved in endless
difficulties and never find true peace or happiness. They should
not feel sad about this, since such people are needed, and serve
useful purposes for others, even though they suffer appreciably
themselves.
Most auspicious: He will be very ambitious, and will dare to
try when others dare not. He will disregard personal safety in
favor of a high goal, and he may gain considerable wealth and
status, but he will have a struggle to keep it.
Least auspicious: He may attain more than the average person
does, but will lose it later. His household and business affairs will
ge.nerally be in a state of disorder.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He will have successes and failures,
                                 advances and retreats.
   Business and professional As above.

                                     major dispute.

KEYNOTES
1. Avoid disputes, or else terminate them quickly.
2. When necessary, retreat, reorganize, and revise plans.
3. Sometimes it is right to keep in the background.
4. If difficulties arise, see whether a change of attitude might be
required.
5. Only make use of qualified persons or ideas, for success.
6. Avoid force or obstinacy.

CONDENSATIONS              FOR   DAILY   CYCLES
1. Terminate any dispute quickly, and good fortune will be yours.
2. You will perhaps encounter a superior force today. Retreat,
regather your strength, and take a new approach even though
you might be inclined to continue the original argument.
3. Keep in the background. The use of force here could get you
into deeper trouble. Follow tried and true methods and you can
achieve success.
4. Your conflict cannot be carried on successfully today. Change
your attitude and accept divine will, and the troubles in your
situation will be resolved.
5. Take any major argument before a qualified arbiter. If right is
on your side you will have much good fortune.
6. What is won by force can be taken away by force. Do not
recklessly take arguments to their ultimate conclusion through
force.


Hexagram 7          Shih   ==     Military Expedition (The Army)


SIMPLE       TRANSLATION          OF TEXT
Water in the earth. The Army. Perseverance, along with correct
and strong leadership, brings good fortune.

COMMENTARY
Man is a microcosm of the macrocosm. Water in the earth
indicates a reservoir of strength and power available for use when
108
                                                3   I   The Predictions
needed. Similarly, the people of a nation are a reservoir of
strength and power, hence the symbol of an army. Man, as the
microcosm, has within himself a vast reservoir of strength and
power which is his own army, and which he can call upon as his
expeditionary force as he ventures through and contends with
the vicissitudes and obstacles of life. There is no question about it;
perseverance, along with correct and strong leadership, will
bring good fortune. Persons born with this hexagram as their
base are destined to be self-willed and generally independent
individuals. They will be wise with regard to their own resources,
and will use them judiciously, as a general would when con-
ducting a military expedition. Naturally, some will be more
wise than others, as is reflected in the various controlling lines.
Sages use all their resources, mental, physical and spiritual, in
the most propitious combination, to the best advantage.
   Those born in the seventh month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line I Discipline is a fundamental requirement for a successful
army. Without it, misfortune is imminent.

The persons symbolized here are learning how to marshal
together all their varying resources, for whatever enterprises
face them. Some learn more quickly than others and hence are
more successful. Out of the ordinary persons are depicted here,
since ordinary people tend to act without deep thought, using
visible factors only. These persons understand that there is more
to life than just what is observed, and are beginning to use all
the other factors. With continued use and experience they will
progress and make improvements. Those who do not think, plan
 and act in this manner will find their lives ruled solely by chance,
and will consequently be subject to much misfortune.
Most auspicious: He will be a good, unselfish leader with a love
for people, and will accomplish much for the benefit of others.
He will make good fortune for himself and will probably become
rich and noble.
Least auspicious: He will be fascinated continually by new
things and new styles, with a disregard for ancient culture and
lore. He will be unstable. If he becomes rich early in life, he will
lose his riches.
                                                                    log

   Officer or official       If loyal to the government, he will
                             receive honors.
   Business and professional An increase in reputation ann
                             profits can be expected.
   Ordinary people           An increase in wealth and goods
                             can be expected. Any rashness may
                             lead to failures.
Line 2 The general in the midst of his army. Good fortune. No
errors. The king decorates him three times.

In the interpretation of I Ching, the fifth line is usually the
ruler, or the 'king.' In this hexagram, line 2 is the ruler, so a
general is depicted.
   Applied to man, this shows a strong leader operating his forces
in a skilful and successful manner. He is equal to the demands
made of him, and so capable, that, on the whole, he will make no
major errors. The receiving of triple decorations signifies that he
is blessed by heaven. Such a person must at all times be aware of
the responsibility he shoulders and the fact that he cannot
separate himself from it without evil creeping in. Here he carries
out what is required of him, and is appropriately honored or
rewarded.
Most auspicious: He will be courageous, firm, upright, non-
tyrannical and considerate. He will exercise good leadership, and
give nourishment and benevolence to the masses.
Least auspicious: He will be a local leader of note, receiving
much respect and honor. His life will be free from major errors.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be honored by the govern-
                               ment, and may be offered a
                               position in the capital or abroad.
   Business and professional He will be a consultant to the
                               government, and may win national
                               acclaim for his individual effort.
   Ordinary people             A very prosperous year.
Line}     Improper leadership. Many corpses.

The leadership and organization are incorrect. Neither the
principal leadership nor the subordinate or delegated authority
110
                                                3   I   The Predictions
are being exercised properly, as might be the result of a weak
man being in an important position without being qualified for it.
Such a person has found the means of rising in status or position,
but as a result of poor judgment and improper values, leaves a
trail of corpses in his wake. Basically, this is a warning for one
with this controlling line as his base to note these characteristics,
and to take steps to overcome and eliminate them in order to
achieve success in life. The correct qualities and traits are
available. He should find them and use them.
Most auspicious: He will be a weak leader, neither trusted nor
respected unless he takes firm steps to improve himself.
Least auspicious: He may make some attempts at leadership,
but with poor results. He will have a hard and short life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Demotion is probable. Some matter
                               with a long-term adverse influence
                               is likely to occur.
   Business and professional Possible failure of business or
                                enterprise (or partial failure) 1S
                               indicated.
   Ordinary people              There will be grief, sorrow and
                               sadness. One parent may die.
Line 4 The army retreats. No censure.

Cautious leadership is depicted here. This is a valuable trait in
many walks of life. Even the most daring leader must retreat
occasionally and alter his tactics. Here, deliberateness in all
activities is presaged. Often such people will not make moves,
even when haste is apparently indicated. This can be annoying
to others, but in the end it is seen that the leadership was correct
and that no error was made. This type of deliberate leader-
ship stems from wisdom and not in any way from weak-
ness or cowardice. The situations that such a person will face
in life will be those in which this type of leadership is appro-
priate.
Most auspicious: In good times he will have a position of
leadership in a business or profession, or with the government. In
adverse times he will take steps to help avoid disasters and troubles.
His leadership will be worthy of emulation by others.
Least auspicious: He will find stability if he remains humble and
                                                                    111

calm, rather than trying to force his methods and ideas on
others.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official       He will find himself in a position
                             or on an assignment without many
                             inducements.
   Business and professional Motivation for professional pro-
                             gress is lacking. Cultural studies
                             would be propitious.
   Ordinary people           His actions should be deliberate,
                             and he will live peacefully and be
                             content with his occupation. He
                             may build a house or travel.
Line 5 There is game in the field. Catch it. The eldest son
leads the hosts. If the younger does not transport the corpses,
calamity.

Correct organization and leadership are depicted here. Game is
available, and this signifies opportunities. The eldest son, in
other words the most experienced, must take the lead, just as in
any successful business enterprise the best qualified are the
leaders in all departments. The youngest, the least experienced,
must not be left idle but should be assigned a specific task or
responsibility in support of the major effort. Persons here must
do the same in the conduct of their lives. Opportunities are
available to them. Their duty to society demands that they go
after the 'game.' Each of their inner resources must be or-
ganized properly and propitiously, and none should be left idle.
All must cooperate and work in harmony for the accomplishment
of major goals, with each doing that for which he is most capable.
Unless this responsibility to self and to others is carried out,
there will be misfortune.
Most auspicious: He will advance readily in a proper way, and
will perform acts of merit and achieve great respect. He will be
famous and popular, and will have a good family.
Least auspicious: He will be learned, and may become 11
'country gentleman.' His household will be in good order, with
the eldest son capable of handling all affairs. If he acts rashly he
will encounter difficulties.
In yearly hexagram;
                                               5   I   The Predictions
  Officer or official          He will either be in, or be assigned
                              to, an important position.
   Business and professional He will gain advancement in his
                               enterprise or profession.
   Ordinary people             Gains in goods and position are
                              likely. Favorable results can be
                               expected from all cooperative
                               efforts. Watch out for troubles
                               stemming from an inept leader or
                               peer.
Line 6 The mISSiOnis accomplished. The ruler issues his
mandates for the new order to his prince, and rewards the
faithful with land. Inferior persons should not be employed.

Proper assignments need to be made. Some persons are great
leaders of men (in the field of battle) while others are great
administrators. Results have been achieved by the expeditionary
forces, and the military leaders are rewarded. The troops. are
paid off and sent horne. Peacetime rule is implemented in both
the new and old territories. Rare are the men who are great
leaders in the field and capable administrators as well. All effort
must be duly rewarded, but for continued progress the right
people must be employed, in every circumstance and condition
one encounters. In a man this should be reflected in flexibility at
all times, mental, physical and spiritual, and the utilization of
those attributes which best suit any given set of circumstances.
Those persons with this controlling line will have the innate
ability to accomplish these things.
Most auspicious: He will be a person who knows and follows
the right way, and who will be honored by superiors. He will
have worthy achievements and a long life, and he may inherit
wealth from his ancestors.
Least auspicious: He may be a wolf in a lamb's skin, presuming
upon people and cheating them by false pretences. His life will
probably be unfortunate.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be in a position of authority,
                               and administer it well.
   Business and professional New administrative methods will
                               produce favorable results.
3    I   The Predictions
     Ordinary people              Family affairs will be put in order,
                                  and he will have a good year. He
                                  may receive an inheritance. Beware
                                  of confidence tricksters.

Hexagram 8 Pi         ==     Uniting

SIMPLE       TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
Water over the earth. Uniting. Consult further as to whether
you possess the qualities and sublimity necessary for leadership.
Those of like mind assemble. Laggards meet misfortune.

COMMENTARY
The hexagram is composed of the trigram K'an, water, over
K'un, earth. Waters on the earth all flow towards the sea,
joining one another and uniting. The inner hexagram, the hidden

114
                                               3   I   The Predictions
influences, i.e. lines 2, 3 and 4, and 3, 4 and 5, form the hexagram
Po, Splitting Apart. Hence the advice to discover whether one is
a true leader before assuming that office. It is also the reason for
stating that laggards meet with disaster. Persons born under this
hexagram will have a natural bent towards leadership, in what-
ever activities they choose to engage in. A humbleness within is
dictated for success, and this includes full analyses and firm
decisions before accepting and assuming any leadership. One's
natural talents and abilities must be suited to the circumstances.
If they are, there will be a natural gravitation that will be
productive of success. Those not appropriately attuned will meet
with difficulties, either through being late, or through attempting
to make progress individually.
   Those born in the seventh month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line I Seeking unity with sincerity is without blame. Con-
fidence, like a full earthen bowl. Unexpected good fortune.

Sincerity is the keynote of any successful union. With confidence
as an added factor, the union should be propitious, even though
no gains are sought in the beginning. These persons will be of
strong character, and will have firm goals which they will pursue
with persistence and resolution. Their inner being will act like a
magnet, attracting others favorably. Their sincerity has the
power to attract benefits from without. The results will be plenti-
ful, 'like a full earthen bowl.'
Most auspicious: He will be a sincere, truthful, plain-spoken
and substantial person, in a good position, attracting others
readily and leading them beneficially.
Least auspicious: He will be helpful to others. He will have
virtually no hardships in life, and everything will seem to flow
freely and easily.
In yearly hexagram:

                                 promotion.

   Ordinary people               He will associate with a friend who
                                 will help him make gains.
3   I   The Predictions
Line 2 Unification and attachment proceeds from one's own
circle (mind). Favorable results through perseverance.

The person depicted here will be a strong and natural leader.
Since this line is in the center position of the trigram K'un, earth,
his success will be primarily in the material and physical spheres
rather than the spiritual and mental. Also, as this is the first
stage of the inner hexagram, things are not as auspicious as
they would be if another inner hexagram were involved. While
this person will have moderate leadership qualities, the implica-
tion is that he should devote some of his time to developing
himself mentally and spiritually, for a balanced life as well as a
more productive one.
Most auspicious: He will be a sincere, honest, honorable and
distinguished leader, held in high esteem, and possessing much
good fortune, especially in a material sense.
Least auspicious: He will also be honest, upright and sincere,
and will attain modest success. He may receive some help from
his wife's family.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He is likely to be transferred to a
                                 position close to those principally in
                                 authority.
   Business and professional Local success and some good for-
                                 tune will be forthcoming.
   Ordinary people               He will receive outside support
                                 from superiors, and plans will
                                 materialize. Women marrying this
                                 year will be fortunate in their
                                 choice of a husband.
 Line}     Seeking unity with the wrong people.

These persons are poor judges of human nature and have
difficulty in selecting proper goals. This controlling line is at the
top of the trigram K'un, earth, and in the middle position in the
lower inner trigram. It is this latter inner tendency which
yearns for leadership and unity, but since it is at the height of
earthly matters, the unities sought are of the wrong kind. Such
persons will have a tendency to try and do things the easy way,
which in the end will prove more difficult. Those with this

116
                                              3   I   The Predictions
controlling line as their base are advised to seek and follow the
counsel of wise persons, rather than relying on their own
judgments and inclinations, even though this may seem difficult.
Most auspicious: He will have inferior relatives and friends,
and will have bad relations with them. He will not attain his
goals, and though he may acquire wealth temporarily, he will
not keep it. He will probably have a short life and no heirs.
Least auspicious: He will be a poor scholar, enjoying the
company of mean and disreputable persons. He may become
afflicted with a serious illness, or incarcerated.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He will quarrel frequently with
                                 colleagues, and will not win.
   Business and professional The year is likely to be trouble-
                                 some, and he may be dismissed.
   Ordinary people               He will be suspicious, unfriendly
                                 and provocative. He may suffer
                                 injury, and will probably also lose
                                 some friends.
Line 4 Seeking cooperation outside your own circle, you should
work through leaders. Perseverance brings good fortune.

While every human being is a salesman to a greater or lesser
degree, those depicted here will be salesmen in a superior
capacity, e.g. entrepreneurs, diplomats, statesmen, and negotia-
tors. Such persons will have a special gift for dealing with leaders
in many fields, and, to go with it, the necessary fortitude and
persistence for success. Since the fourth line is the upper line for
man in the equal partnership between heaven, man and earth,
he will constantly strive to improve himself, and will keep
abreast of the times.
Most auspicious: He will be a modest man, rendering superior
service to his organization and its leaders. He will attain promi-
nence and riches, which he will be able to retain. He will have a
good family life, and will render much service to others.
Least auspicious: A life similar to that for the most auspicious
is indicated, generally favorable but to a lesser degree.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He can expect promotion, and an
                                increase in personal possessions.
5   I   The Predictions
    Business and professional He will have increased prominence
                              and work, with substantial profits.
   Ordinary people            He may be helped by an intimate
                              friend or a stranger. All things will
                              go very well.
Line 5 Illustration of seeking union and attachments. The king
used beaters on three sides but lost the quarry on the other side.
The people understood this. Good fortune.

Kingliness and benevolence characterize these persons. In ancient
times, when I Ching was developed, the kings used beaters on
three sides when hunting game, allowing an access for escape on
the fourth side. It was considered that destiny was active here,
and that only such game as was fated to be caught did not escape.
Persons with this controlling line as their base will develop their
inner characteristics to the point of kingliness, and will have a
natural attraction. Their purposes and aims will be high, but
they will not force anyone to join in their enterprises against
their wishes. Hence, those who come will do so voluntarily, and
will be those who are meant to join. This will result in blessings
 and benefits for all concerned.
Most auspicious: He will be a just and impartial person, helping
others and rendering service to mankind. He will most likely have
 a government position at some time, at the executive seat of such
 activity (local, state, national, etc.).
 Least auspicious: He also will be a just and upright person,
 and an open-minded man, willing to help others. He may have
 hardships early in life, with things improving considerably later.
 In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official           Promotion is likely. A good year.
    Business and professional He will be honored in his own
                                  sphere. Profits will increase.
    Ordinary people                Favorable conditions will prevail.
 Line 6 Striving for unity without a head. Misfortune imminent.

The person depicted here is somewhat deficient in virtue, and
others will not readily obey him. Trying to lead without proper
qualifications results in disaster. Similarly, if unity is sought
without a suitable leader, misfortune is probable. People cannot


                                                                        II

the microcosm, cannot unite the resources within himself without
providing the proper leadership for himself. This is advice for
those born under this line to constantly re-assess themselves,
since what they externally reflect and achieve sterns from, and is
dependent on, what is within.
Most auspicious: If he does not improve, although he is a man
of good personality, he will lack in substance, and so will lose
chances for advancement. He may well regret his ways, and
repent, too late.
Least auspicious: He will probably have a short life with many
hardships; he may withdraw into solitude.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He will be isolated, and will not be
                              helped by friends or associates.
   Business and professional Achievements will be difficult.
   Ordinary people            A difficult year. He may be faced
                              with lawsuits, disaster, or serious
                              quarrels.

KEYNOTES
1.   Attraction is attained through sincerity.
2.   External unity begins inwardly.
3.   Look to yourself if you are attracting the wrong people.
4.   For successful accomplishments, work with leaders.
5.   Kingly qualities produce supreme results.
6.   Ineptitude destroys unity.

CONDENSATIONS        FOR.   DAILY   CYCLES
1. Work with one who is an innate leader, and good fortune will
result.
2. One's inner disposition and aspirations parallel those of the
leader or ruler. Show loyalty openly.
3. Beware of associating with, or seeking to associate with, the
wrong people.
4. When seeking unity outside your own circle, cooperate and
work with the leaders first.
5. Natural confidence prevails. You should exercise firm and
just leadership. Good results can then be expected.
6. Striving to achieve unity without proper leadership results in
failure. Heed this warning.

Hexagram 9      Hsiao Ch'u   =-=   Small Power


SIMPLE    TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
Restrained Small Power. Dense clouds in the west. No rain yet.

COMMENTARY
This hexagram symbolizes the wind (trigram Sun) blowing
across the sky (trigram Ch'ian), producing dense clouds but no
rain. Rain falling symbolizes the completion of an enterprise.
The wind blowing across the sky advises one to display one's
mental, physical and material accomplishments in preparations
for the achieving of results. The persons depicted here are likely
to be liaison personnel, salesmen, or in advertising, the graphic
arts or electronics. Progress relates primarily to the development
of new ideas, or goods, with success for the individuals themselves
as well as for the matters they work on.
   Those born in the eleventh month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line I Returning to the way. How can this be blameworthy?
Good fortune.

This person knows intuitively the right path, and the proper
courses to follow. The first line indicates beginnings, so if he
returns to the beginning and follows the path that he knew was
right all along, what error can there be? Naturally, such action
is in keeping with divine will, so he will have good fortune.
Persons of common sense and good judgment are symbolized,
who are also enthusiastic and ambitious.
Most auspicious: He will follow the right way through life,
aware of deviations, and knowing when to stop and when to
proceed. His life will be good, and no one will be able to
harm him. He will be loyal to the ruler of his country and
to his leaders. He will also be helpful to his family and to
others.
Least auspicious: He will also be a resolute, straightforward
and upright man, not vain and not admiring hollow fame or
titles. He will also have a good life. The least auspicious of all
will be lonely, or recluses.

In yearly hexagram:

                             position and attain good results.
   Business and professional The advancement of new models,

   Ordinary people           A quiet year. Beware of being
                             suspicious; it could lead to trouble.
Line 2 Drawn into returning. Good fortune.

A still more intelligent person is represented here. This man has
begun to progress, and is wise enough to see impediments and
restraints occurring when improper courses are followed, and
hence returns to the way which he knows will achieve success.
He will know also how to cooperate with others, and will be a
very successful communicator of ideas.
Most auspicious: He will be a self-disciplined and self-willed
person. He will choose good friends, and will communicate well
with his family, superiors and associates. He is likely to have a
high position, and at some time work for the government. He
will attain his aims and purposes.
Least auspicious: He will be communicative and cooperative,
but sometimes with the wrong people, which will injure his
chances for achievement and success. However, he will have no
great hardships.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be at the head of his
                                organization or unit.
   Business and professional He will be a leader in national or
                               world affairs. Gains are predicted.
   Ordinary people             He will have the cooperation of
                               others, and will be successful. The
                               least auspicious may experience
                               failures.
Line J Carriage and spoked wheel part. Husband's and wife's
eyes glare.

These individuals are the type who readily say, 'Why isn't it
done this way?' or 'Do it that way,' etc., without reference to the
realities and the facts of the situation, and believing their
                                                                  121

opposition to be slight. In general, they will be mistaken in their
evaluations, and, as often happens in a marital situation, annoying
arguments will occur, with each person trying to blame the other.
Little hope is offered to such persons, as it is their innate judgment
which is deficient. It would be best for them not to try to rise
high in status or position. By remaining at a low level, they will
be able to find reasonable contentment.
Auspiciousness: Not auspicious for anyone. A few may establish
some merit. All will tend to be stubborn and greedy, and quarrel-
some with their wives, families and others. They will readily
blame others for their own faults and deficiencies.
In yearly hexagram:
   For everyone                  A troublesome year, with illnesses,
                                 partings, separation from family or
                                 friends, as well as difficulties
                                 professionally.
Line 4 Sincerity and confidence cause bloodshed to be averted.
Apprehensions give way. No error.


Persons acting with sincerity and confidence induce trust in
others, and consequently apprehensions disappear. These persons
should be upright and reliable, and their leadership will generate
emulation by others, and no errors will be made. Those who are
both intelligent and wise will exercise great influence. Those who
are immodest and stupid are likely to cause bloodshed.
Most auspicious: He will be open-minded, modest, sincere, and
confident, following the right paths. He will be a noble person
with no great sorrows or hardships. He will be helped by his
seniors, and will have a good family life.
Least auspicious: He is likely to be jealous and suspicious, with
no firm goals, ideas or opinions. He may be ill frequently and
subject to many hardships and sorrows, with few or no friends.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be transferred, or promoted
                               to a better position, on the recom-
                               mendation of his colleagues.
   Business and professional His life will be enhanced and
                               advanced by his peers and associates,
                               and by his seniors.

  Ordinary people          His desires will mostly be accom-
                           plished, with modest success. The
                           least auspicious may receive a
                           serious injury.
Line 5 Trustworthiness binds like a cord. Enrichment between
neighbors.

These persons are strong in virtue, even more so than those
described by line 4, and are leaders primarily by example.
Trustworthiness and sincerity induce confidence in others, both
at higher and lower levels. Their inner strength is so great that
it will automatically influence the hearts of others in beneficial
ways. This will be true whether their work is at a purely local
level; or in a business or governmental enterprise, but especially
true in matters where protection against adverse or evil in-
fluences is involved.
Most auspicious: He will be rich, and will share his opulence
with others. He will be noble in mind and character, and humble
in dealings with others. He will be admired and respected by
many people.
Least auspicious: Though not able to be independent, he will
receive help from persons possessing both material and mental
riches, and will thus be able to enjoy a good life, even though his
achievements will be indifferent.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will receive trust from his
                               seniors and respect from his juniors,
                                and he will be promoted.
   Business and professional He will be respected by the public,
                                and will find that others share his
                               views. He may attain fame.
   Ordinary people              He will receive outside help, and
                               will thus attain his aims.
Line 6 The rains come. It is now the time for rest. Persistence
brings troubles to the woman. The moon is nearly full. If the
superior man ventures further, calamity is probable.

The gathering of the clouds mentioned at the beginning of the
hexagram has now produced rain. The enterprise has been
consummated as a result of the extensive application of small
3    I   The Predictions
power. To try to proceed further, before the time is ripe, either
with the persistence of a woman or with the strength of a superior
man, would be wrong, and would produce calamity since the
moon is nearly full, signifying that negative influences are close
to their maximum. It is these negative influences which govern
here. Persons born under this line are advised that the energetic
development of a positive force is the only way to counter and
overcome the negative. They must work on their inner selves
so that the positive force can later be manifested externally. Any
major external activity at first could result in calamity.
Most auspicious: He will be rich and powerful enough to be of
benefit to others, and will enjoy a life free from great losses or
serious troubles.
Least auspicious: He will have many ups and downs. After
acquiring profits he will lose them quickly. Women will tend
to be cruel and shrewish, and will probably have a short, unhappy
life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          One following an evil path will be
                                dismissed. Lesser offences will be
                                reprimanded.
   Business and professional Improper practices will result in
                                litigation, and loss of reputation
                                and profits.
   Ordinary people              Upright and calm persons may have
                                a fair year by virtue of their good
                                character. Others, if not deceitful or
                                crafty themselves, may be besieged
                                by such persons, with bad results.

KEYNOTES
1.   Returning to the right path cannot be wrong.
2.   Cooperating with others is beneficial.
3.   Heedless actions will result in disaster.
4.   Use sincerity and confidence at all times.
5.   Trustworthy leadership brings success.

Hexagram    10   La   ==   Treading (Conduct)


SIMPLE   TRANSLATION       OF TEXT
Treading on the tail of the tiger. It does not bite him. Progress
and success. Heaven above, lake below. The superior man
consults the high and the low and fortifies the people's
thinking.

COMMENTARY
This hexagram basically relates to the development and use of
correct conduct at all times and in all circumstances, resulting in
progress and success along one's chosen path. The words 'treading
on the tail of the tiger' are an ancient Chinese way of signifying
hazardous conditions. The reason why the tiger does not bite the
man comes from the lower trigram, Tui (joy, lake), being below
and reflecting the upper trigram Ch'ien (heaven). How could
there be a mirroring of heaven and joy if one were in the fangs of
a tiger? The persons depicted here are, however, faced with
many hazardous conditions. Fortunately, they have the innate
capacity to discriminate between good and bad, right and
wrong, using elements of both the high and the low as the
foundation for their decisions. Persons born under this hexagram
can be found in any walk of life where analytical activity
is involved and discriminatory powers are a necessary attri-
bute.
   Those born in the third month will be more auspicious.
3   I   The Predictions

CONTROLLING         LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line    I   Simple conduct. Going forward produces no errors.

At the beginning, i.e., the bottom line of any hexagram, a man
has, unless otherwise stated, an obligation to take the initial
steps by himself and of his own free will. At this point he is not
yet bound by contracts. By conducting his life simply, this man
will be able to make progress without blame Or error. He will do
this on his own, without the assistance of others. He will have
much activity in his life, and will act with firmness and correct-
ness. Hence he will be following the right paths, and will benefit
both himself and others.
Most auspicious: He will be vigorous and courageous, but
somewhat conservative, simple in desires and without external
show. His leadership will be strong and dignified, and his influence
will extend to many persons, both nationally and internationally.
Least auspicious: He will attend to improving his own conduct
and virtue in privacy; he may even become a recluse Or a monk.
His development will be continual, and his life modestly good.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will foster and encourage right
                                methods and the progress of other
                                people. Promotion is likely.
   Business and professional A year of hard work, using known
                                methods. He will increase his
                                reputation and profits.
   Ordinary people              Hard workers will make gains. For
                                the least auspicious: a member of
                                the family may die.

Line 2 The solitary man treads his path peacefully. He brings
good fortune to himself.

The path trodden here is higher and more noble than that trodden
in line 1. This man is more introspective, desirous of accom-
plishing major goals, and inclined t.okeep his deepest thoughts to
himself. He will know the golden mean, and for the most part
will follow it. His goals are firm, and he will not let himself
become confused. These persons are somewhat unusual in that
126
                                             3   I   The Predictions
they are quite self-sufficient, men of peace doing whatever is set
before them, for the benefit of others.
Most auspicious: He will be deeply interested in mental and
spiritual matters, and will follow the way of Tao, i.e. action
through inaction. He will only be ambitious to a limited degree,
but persistent in completing whatever he begins. He will not
seek unattainable fame or honors, and will find much happiness
in contemplating, and being surrounded by nature. He will
achieve peace of mind.
Least auspicious: Principally, he will be a man of leisure,
following the right paths. He will make no demands on others,
and will not seek fame or fortune, nor will he be defamed. He
will have a reasonably good life.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official         He may be assigned to an easy
                                position, or retire with honor.
    Business and professional Destiny will seemingly be inactive.
    Ordinary people             He will be content, and will enjoy
                                peace and harmony. Communi-
                                cating and cooperating with the
                                right people may bring him gains.
                                The least auspicious may die.
Line J The one-eyed man (thinks he) can see. The lame man
 (thinks he) can walk. He treads on the tail of the tiger and is
bitten. Disaster. The warrior (thinks he) battles on behalf of his
lord.

Here is a weak person using strength beyond his capacity, with
dangerous results. A one-eyed man can see, but his perceptions
are imperfect. A lame man can walk, but not fast enough to
make progress with others. This line is in a position of strength,
so bravado and brashness are implied. When meeting hazardous
conditions, one does not overcome them properly through such
behavior, and disaster results. One should act in such a manner
only when fighting for one's lord. Persons born under this line
are likely to have little knowledge or experience, but use great
strength and drive. By the exercise of caution, and through
self-development, they may be able to overcome their weaknesses.
Most auspicious: He will pride himself on being out of the
ordinary, but without justification. He will despise and look
                                                                 127
3   I The Predictions
down on other people. His plans are unlikely to be achieved, and
his hard, tough attitude will result in continual troubles.
Least auspicious: He will be a person of low station in life,
possibly even crippled or deformed. He is likely to he a stupid
person, and will probably have a short life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer 01" official        Demotion in "auk, position or
                              salary is likely.
   Business and professional He may suffer loss of reputation,
                               accompanied by a decrease in profit.
   Ordinary people             There will be disputes and lawsuits.
                               He may be incarcerated, ruin his
                              family, or die.
Line 4 He treads on the tail of the tiger. Prudence is required.
Good fortune in the end.

Self-reliance, self-confidence and good judgment are indicated
here. These are founded on knowledge, common sense and
experience. This man will know where he is going, and is sure
in himself that he will get there. With this controlling line,
in this position, he should not forge ahead rashly or act impetu-
ously, but rather proceed steadily and with caution. He will
meet many difficult situations which he will overcome, and in the
end he will have good fortune.
Most auspicious: He will serve his family, his work and his
nation with diligence, respect and care. He will be able to
overcome dangerous situations through calm speech and a gentle
attitude, and will convert likely disasters into good fortune.
Least auspicious: He will experience many hardships early in
life, but will have a fairly good, routine life later.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will probably be assigned to
                               the charge of an important activity.
   Business and professional He will achieve new recognition
                               and increased profits.
   Ordinary people              Difficult situations are probable.
                               Advance with caution.
Line 5 Resolute advancement. Despite firmness and Correct-
ness, peril.


128
                                               3 / The Predictions
This man is constantly striving to improve his conduct through
resolute advancement, in consonance with the meaning of the
hexagram, and this would normally have good portents. In
keeping with the law of physics which states that to every action
there is an equal and opposite reaction, resolute advancement,
despite firmness and correctness, will meet with opposition and
perils. Primarily, this is the result of his striving too hard for
rapid advancement. He should be aware that the higher he rises,
the greater may be his fall.
Most auspicious: He will be courageous in cultivating his
virtue. He will strive to follow the right way at all times, and
will drive out evil whenever and wherever possible. He will
encourage and promote good, and will carry out his purposes re-
gardless of the consequences. His life will be beneficial to others.
Least auspicious: He will face many hardships, have few friends,
and will possibly encounter a major disaster. He will tend to be a
wanderer, seeking to find himself.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will have great achievements,
                               without any reward.
   Business and professional He will be honest and virtuous,
                               without gaining any fame or profit.
   Ordinary people             If he is honest and upright, he will
                               have good results. The least auspi-
                               cious may be reckless, easily pro-
                               voked, and cause trouble, or may
                               even die.
Line 6 Analyze your conduct. Note the omens. If all is complete
and favorable, supreme good fortune.

This line is at the top of the cycle of Conduct, and the advice is
virtually self-explanatory. If progress has been favorable,
favorable results can be expected. If not, changes have to be
made. The persons represented here will be analytical, and,
since they already have made considerable progress, will be
individuals with above average capabilities. How they use their
attributes, and how well they heed the results of their analyses,
will determine the nature and effectiveness of their lives.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of wisdom and virtue, rich,
fortunate and famous, and he will be of great benefit to others.
                                                                129
3    I   The Predictions
Least auspicious: He will use his analytical and other abilities
for evil purposes. He may make gains, but however hard he tries
to hold on to them, his efforts will be in vain.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        Those in high positions will retreat,
                               and withdraw to a peaceful life.
   Business and professional He will gain in reputation, position,
                               and profits.
   Ordinary people             He will increase his possessions.
                               The least auspicious may die.

KEYNOTES
1. Simple conduct is without criticism.
2. There is no blame in treading paths peacefully.
3. The lowly should not try to be greater than they are.
4. Exercise prudence when danger is imminent.
5. When the time is ripe, advance resolutely.
6. Through analyses, you can learn what results you may
expect.

CONDENSATIONS              FOR   DAILY   CYCLES
1. If one acts in accordance with accepted rules of conduct, at
the beginning, no mistakes will be made.
2. Conduct yourself as does a hermit, i.e. be quiet and un-
assuming, and make no demands. By so doing, you will achieve
results and not become confused.
3. If one acts heedlessly with respect to superiors, adversity is
sure to be forthcoming. The exercising of a strong will here can
be dangerous.
4. Provided caution and tact are exercised, one can deal success-
fully with dangerous situations and people.
5. Be gentle in conduct and show humility, otherwise you will
stumble.
6. Review your situation. If the steps taken so far have been
favorable, good fortune can be anticipated. This is the only way
you can know what to expect in the future.

SIMPLE     TRANSLATION     OF TEXT
Peace. The small is gone. The great approaches. Progress.
Success. Good fortune.

COMMENTARY
The communion of the Creative and the Receptive, in a state of
balance, brings peace. Ch'ien, heaven, is below and moving
upward into K'un, earth, above and moving downward. They are
blending equally in perfect harmony and complementing each
other. Working together in this manner brings peace. Hence,
this man should make progress in life, which will bring success
and good fortune. The high will help the low and the low co-
operate with the high. It is a time of service and benefit, bringing
blessings to all. Wise, magnanimous, and productive leadership is
depicted here. These persons are peacemakers, bringers of
prosperity, and successful innovators. Generally speaking, they
are superior persons who will set an example worthy of emulation
by others.
   Those born in the first month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING      LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line   1 When grass is pulled up, sod and roots come too. It is
auspicious to advance now as planned.

Progressive leadership is indicated, whereby the leader draws
others, well grounded and of like mind, along with him in public
matters. Such persons will all have the instinct to advance, and
will find themselves naturally drawn to the leader. This co-
operative effort of minds and bodies is bound to be productive,
and, since the time is right, the results will be successful. The
leaders are very capable, but they must recognize that they
shoulder grave responsibilities which cannot be shed.
Most auspicious: He will be intelligent, lofty of purpose, up-
right, and pure in mind. He will associate and be intimate with
superior men, and will not become involved with evil-minded
persons. He will be just and impartial to all. He will attain
honors, have worthwhile achievements, and may even become
famous and rich.
Least auspicious: He will be a leader on a small scale or in a

local way. He will communicate well with his family, friends
and associates, and will have a good life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He will be helped and respected by
                              associates and peers. He can expect
                              promotion and other gains.
   Business and professional He will be honored, and will
                              advance mentally and materially.
   Ordinary people            Planning and cooperating with
                              friends and associates will result
                              in gains.
Line 2 Bearing with the uncultured. Fording the stream.
Aware of what is distant. Remembering his associates left behind.
He follows the golden mean.

Men of great ability, using their potential effectively, are depicted
here. They recognize that no person or material is useless in the
hands of the Creator, and they adhere to this principle in their
lives. Fording the stream means engaging in enterprises. This
such men will do independently. They are true leaders, pioneers
in government, business and industry, and the many arts and
sciences. Their greatness is further illustrated by their possessing
the common sense to know what lies ahead of them and being
able, therefore, to act correctly at all times. In addition, they
will always remember their friends and associates from the past,
never discarding them as is done by so many who rise to high
position.
Most auspicious: He will be wise and broad-minded, sensible,
upright, impartial and just. He will possess the ability to help
bring peace to the world, and will enjoy a long, rich, noble and
rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He also will possess,noble traits, but he will
use them only at a local level. He may become rich, and his life
will be good.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be assigned to an important
                                and influential position, and will be
                               successful.
   Business and professional He will have advancements, gains
                                and fame.
                                                 sI   The Predictions
  Ordinary people           He will meet, and make, influen-
                            tial friends, and will have material
                            gains. A good year.
Line J Every plain is followed by a slope; every going by a
return. Consistency and persistence amid danger. No error.
Knowing this, he maintains faith and joy.

Here the law of change is exemplified, namely, that all things
and all situations are subject to inevitable rise and fall, coming
and going, growth and decay, etc., with the passage of time.
Even the states of peace depicted in this hexagram are not left
undisturbed. This man recognizes the law of the universe for
what it is, maintains his goals, and acts with consistency and
persistence, while being flexible with regard to changing
conditions. He will certainly have faith in the world, and will
experience much joy. Negotiators and arbiters are depicted here.
Their principal mission will be to restore peace under hard and
trying conditions.
Most auspicious: He will be steadfast in purpose, and will
maintain his uprightness even in difficult situations and circum-
stances. He will do his utmost to carry out divine will. He will enjoy
the fruits of his labors, and will have an easy and restful later life.
Least auspicious: He will have some successesand some failures/
and his good fortune will be self-made. He will also render
beneficial service to others.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          His job will be difficult. He should
                                beware of deceitful and dishonest
                                persons, and of jealousies.
   Business and professional He should hold on to what he has,
                                and should not take chances but
                                seek only attainable goals.
   Ordinary people              By restricting himself to his own
                                household and immediate affairs,
                                he will have a good year. The least
                                auspicious may be cheated by
                                deceitful or dishonest persons.
Line 4 Vacillations and fluctuations. Supported by the wealth
of neighbors. Trusting and sincere.
5   I   The Predictions
Many situations are fraught with difficulties. In keeping with
the symbolism, here, of the lines for man, i.e. the third and
fourth lines, line 4 is a Yin line leading a Yaug, and in addition
line 4 has two more Yang lines behind it, pushing upward. This
makes the situation difficult, and the Yin, being weak, makes for
vacillation here in goals, intentions and actions. These will be
aimed in the right direction, but are unlikely to produce great
consistent successes. The wealth which comes from neighbors is
given by the three Yang lines, the neighbors of the Yin line 4,
tending to rise and come to the support of those having difficulties.
The persons depicted here are ever sincere, and will never lose
their trust and faith in people, especially their close friends.
This reflects the inner sentiments of all concerned. These persons
will not, however, be as wise as they ought to be for the work
that they seek to accomplish, or the positions they wish to fill.
Their vacillation will come mainly from a lack of knowledge and
confidence.
Most auspicious: He will face many hazardous conditions in life.
He will have many doubts and will be unable to keep his mind
concentrated on his goals and aims, lacking singleness of purpose.
He will make some gains and some losses, and his life will not be
easy.
Least auspicious: Basically, he will not have a strong character,
and he will have to depend on friends and relations for support.
He will not be qualified to act independently.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He should hold fast or perhaps
                                even retreat. Extreme caution must
                                be exercised to avoid serious trouble.
   Business and professional As above.
   Ordinary people              Stick to tried and proven methods
                                to avoid difficulties.
Line 5 The emperor gives his daughter in marriage. Felicity
 and good fortune.

A fundamental message of I Ching is expressed here, namely, that
to rule truly is to serve. (This is also shown in Hexagram 42, I,
Increase.) The emperor referred to is Ti Yi, the last emperor of
the Yin dynasty, who decreed that daughters of the emperor,
after marriage, should take precedence only as befitted the wife
                                                5   I   The Predictions
of their espoused. This avoided many difficulties and embarrassing
situations, and resulted in understandings and good relations
which were a blessing to the realm. Those born under this line
will likewise fare well and be a blessing to others, if they sub-
ordinate some of their abilities, and delegate their authority and
responsibilities.
Most auspicious: He will be a great and good leader and find it
easy to obtain honors, riches and fame, if he desires them. He
will always remain humble, and will be reverential in nature.
He (or she) will have a good wife (husband) and a noble heir. He
rules primarily through the proper choice of subordinates to
whom he delegates appropriate authority and responsibility.
Least auspicious: He also will be of benefit to others, and prosper-
ous. He will enjoy a good life, and will be honored and respected.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will either be promoted or have
                                occasion for much joy.
   Business and professional He will make progress and gains.
   Ordinary people              He will be respected by others, and'
                                will have much good fortune. He
                                may get married or increase the
                                size of his family.
Line 6 The wall falls into the moat. Refrain from fighting.
Maintain order in your city. Even with correctness and firmness,
some blame cannot be avoided.

Disuse results in disintegration. This is a universal truth. Once
the decay has set in it is difficult to maintain order and discipline.
Even efforts at firmness and correctness prove somewhat in-
effective, since they were not instituted in time. The persons
depicted here have gained some knowledge and experience, but
have failed to use these further. They have not remained
flexible, nor have they kept up to date so that their abilities
would continue to be of use. Everyone knows that if you do not
practise a foreign language you lose your ability to use it, no
matter how well you once knew it. So it is with other matters.
Heed this warning.
Most auspicious: If humble, modest and mentally active, he
may be able to establish some gains and benefits. He will have a
life full of hazards and difficulties.
3    I   The Predictions
Least auspicious: He will be conceited and boastful, impu-
dent, intimidating, and perhaps sometimes violent. He will
make difficulties for others, and perhaps even ruin his own
family.
In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official         Degradation is indicated.
   Business and professional He will experience shame and
                             defamation.
   Ordinary people           Enterprises will collapse, and he
                             will have illnesses and other
                             troubles. By remaining modest and
                             humble, some of the difficulties
                             can be averted.

                                                 5 I The Predictions


Hexagram     I2   P'i   ==   Standstill (Stagnation)


SIMPLE     TRANSLATION       OF TEXT
Standstill. Lack of understanding between the high and the low.
The great departs. The small approaches.

COMMENTARY
Heaven and earth are not in communion, hence stagnation and
standstill. Ch'ien, heaven, is above and moving upward. K'un,
earth, is below and moving downward. When heaven and earth
do not cooperate and work together, nothing productive is
accomplished. This is where the symbolism of the high and the
low not being in accord comes from. Weakness is within and
strength without, e.g. weakness at the seat of a government,
with strength in its armies throughout the country. In a man, it
is weakness of intellect, purpose, and mental activity, while
being externally and physically strong. Mistrust prevails in the
government, and gainful activity is not possible in private life.
The superior man does not allow himself to be tempted by
honors and fame, and withdraws from public life. Others are
advised to study and prepare themselves within for subsequent
activity. Those born under this hexagram would do well to keep
themselves up to date.
   Those born in the seventh month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM     BOTTOM      TO TOP)
Line I When grass is pulled up, sod and roots come too.
Righteous persistence brings good fortune and success.

At the onset of evil, removing oneself from it through active
persistence in righteous courses leads to good fortune and success.
This man is a leader who draws others along with him into
seclusion. He will possess common sense, intelligence and good
judgment. He will know when and how to act correctly, and
will follow such courses as will be good for him and others.
Most auspicious: He will be a man born to a family of honor and
fame. He will further his lineage and cultural heritage in a
proper and beneficial manner. He will engage in enterprises
3   I   The Predictions
designed to help protect the nation and those who render service
to the people. His life will be a blessing to others.
Least auspicious: He will know when to advance and when to
retreat. He will meet with hardships occasionally throughout his
life, and will have difficulty in following the right path. He will
not be ruined, and will be able to maintain himself and his
family.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Beware of injury and misrepre-
                                sentations.
   Business and professional It will be hard to find good
                                opportunities for successful activ-
                                ity.
   Ordinary people              A routine year, but be on the
                                lookout for trouble from mean
                                people.
Line 2 Authorities favor the obsequious now. This means good
fortune for the inferior. The superior man adjusts himself to
the standstill and has success.

The inferior are very weak, but the superior man remains stead-
fast. Even though the weak are favored they are so weak that
they cannot accomplish their purposes. The strong follow the
right path, regardless of external circumstances and conditions.
Since I Ching is designed for the superior man it is right to
assume that a person with this controlling line will have superior
qualities. He will be a leader, and will see through the motives
and actions of others, avoiding any association with their mean-
ness. He will take actions accordingly, bearing in mind the
serving of others.
Most auspicious: He will be noble, broad-minded and intelligent,
following the golden mean and right paths. He will quietly
await the right moments for action, and then strike effectively.
He will have the potential to turn deviations into righteousness,
to break down obstructions in the way of peace, and to turn
misfortune into good fortune. He will not be disturbed or
destroyed by the difficulties he meets along the way.
Least auspicious: He will be an ordinary person, with some
good and some bad. He should be cautious throughout his life to
avert injury and disaster.
                                             3 / The Predictions
In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official       He should be conservative, and
                            retreat if necessary until the right
                            time for action.
  Business and professional As above.
  Ordinary people           He should be tolerant, cautious,
                            and well-intentioned, otherwise he
                            will be involved in troubles.
Line}   He endures his shame.

Mean people would like to harm the good, but are held back.
Line 3 is at the top of the trigram K'un, and therefore indicates
meanness, but the trigram Ch'ien is immediately above, so
these people are restrained from taking the actions they would
like to take. Persons having this controlling line will be more
unfortunate than most, to a greater or lesser degree. Their
destiny is such that they cannot do much more than make a living.
They have several importarit lessons they must learn in this life,
in order to overcome and rise above fate.
Most auspicious: He will meet a noble or superior man who
will trust him and help him mentally and materially, and may
also help him more than once to obtain professional employment.
His best course, however, would be to become a monk, a priest or
a recluse.
Least auspicious: He will be unable to follow the right paths.
Furthermore, he will be so poor in mental and material wealth
that he is likely to pursue evil paths.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will retire, or be demoted in
                                salary or position.
   Business and professional Defamations and insults are likely
                                and will possibly be damaging.
   Ordinary people              Disputes and lawsuits are likely.
Line 4 Whoever follows the will and ordinations of heaven will
remain free from censure. Associates of like mind share in his
blessings.

A strong and wise leader is depicted here. How many people can
discern the will and ordinations of heaven? Such a person has
found the true tao (or 'way'). His inner strength is such that he

                                                              159
:5 I   The Predictions
will automatically draw others to him. They will think and act
in accord with him, and will therefore be blessed too.
Most auspicious: He will be a noble man of many achievements,
from which he will derive fame and good fortune. His life will be
one of service to others, and it will be long, satisfying, and filled
with many friendships.
Least auspicious: He also will have a long life of beneficial
service from which he will attain good fortune. He will acquire
appreciable property and wealth, and will be constantly active
until his death.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will receive help from col-
                               leagues, and will also be promoted.
   Business and professional He will be recommended by author-
                               ities, and will probably achieve
                               fame.
   Ordinary people              He will have an increase in prop-
                                erty and money, and several minor
                                good fortunes.
 Line 5 The standstill is coming to an end. Fortune favors the
superior man to restore conditions. Dangers still prevail. He
strengthens himself like a bound cluster of mulberry trees.

A leader capable of restoring peaceful conditions is now at hand.
Time has nearly fulfilled itself in the cycle of stagnation and
standstill. However, some dangers are still present, and therefore,
in order to be certain of overcoming them, the superior man holds
himself together, as one might bind together a number of
mulberry trees for added strength. This means that such a
leader should marshal all his abilities for the greatest possible
strength in order to overcome the dangers and restore conditions
of peace. Another point of view is that such a person instructs
and unites others, so likewise obtaining added strength for over-
coming whatever difficulties they mutually face, as well as
providing a method for maintaining the new conditions. This
person will be a wise, knowledgeable, experienced and fearless
leader.
Most auspicious: He will be a wise and virtuous man, impartial
and cautious, knowing how to restore order and how to avoid
troubles in advance. He will be able to withstand mental,
                                             5   I   The Predictions
physical or spiritual stagnation, and will enjoy long friendships,
riches and honors.
Least auspicious: He will he a virtuous man of modest talents,
who cannot achieve all he would like to accomplish. He will have
an flasylife with adequate wealth and possessions, hut no fame.
I Il yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official        He will be assigned to a high and
                               influential position.
    Business and professional Old troubles depart. New fortune
                               is on its way, with gains and
                               profits.
    Ordinary people            Sorrows will turn to joy. Losses
                               will be recovered. There will be
                               new gains as well.
Line 6 The standstill has been overcome. First there was
standstill; now great joy.

The cycle of stagnation and obstruction has run its course and is
now over. The topmost line is a Yang, signifying a strong leader
who works in keeping with the law of change, and helps bring
about an end to adverse conditions. This leadership will be
founded on deep and intimate knowledge of ancient wisdom and
lore. This person will work with the will of heaven, and will be
the focal point for bringing about peaceful conditions, either
consciously or unconsciously. These persons will usually be
found in key positions in their chosen field.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of great ambitions, and
clever enough to carry them out successfully. He will have some
hardships early in life, with all matters smoothing out later, to
make life very enjoyable in his senior years. He will be noble in
character, and a blessing to all his associates.
Least auspicious: He will find it difficult to attain a favorable
reputation and make profits. He may be subjected to serious
injury. Becoming a monk or a recluse would make for a simpler
life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         If unemployed at present, he will
                               obtain a good position.
   Business and professional Things are slowly picking up, with
                               the prospect of advancements.

                                     drawnout lawsuits will soon have
                                     them settled in their favor.

KEYNOTES
1. When retreat is inevitable, withdraw cooperatively.
2. Take independent action when this is deemed necessary.
3. Being expansive without proper qualifications is wrong.
4. Always try to act in accordance with the will of heaven.
5. When matters are discordant, unite the divergent elements.
6. Strong leadership is required to bring any stagnation to an
end.

CONDENSATIONS              FOR   DAIL Y CYCLES
1. Like attracts like. Quietly proceed, with firmness and right-
eousness. The results should be good.
2. Today you must work alone. Take superior actions, and
restore peace.
3. If one attempts to achieve something beyond one's authority
and ability, one must bear the shame which will ensue.
4. Whoever acts in accordance with the will of heaven will
commit no errors. Be correct and obedient with respect to
authority.

into the situation.


Hexagram        I}   T'ung Jen     ==   Fellowship, Brotherhood


SIMPLE        TRANSLATION         OF TEXT
Fellowship in the open. Success. It is advantageous to cross the
great stream. The superior man benefits from maintaining firm
correctness.

COMMENTARY
Unions between men are based on having a common goal,
coupled with clarity and strength within the individuals. This

142
                                              3   I The Predictions
hexagram fulfills these requirements by having clarity within,
i.e. the lower trigram, Li, and strength without, trigram, Ch'ien.
When the goals are such that they can be known and agreed on
by everyone, meetings can be held in the open. This augurs
success. Enterprises can be begun. Regrettably, in any union
there is a danger of selfish or separatist attitudes creeping in.
Therefore the superior man benefits by maintaining firm
correctness. A systematic arrangement, with everything having
its proper place, is presaged. Persons who are destined to be
leaders in uniting people are depicted here. How well they fare
in accomplishing their aims is determined by their controlling
line.
    Those born in the first month will be more auspicious.

CONTR.OLLING      LINES   (FR.OM   BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line   I   Union at the gate. No blame.

Organizers forming unions 'at the gate,' i.e. in the open for
everyone to see, will engender no blame. The true leaders among
these persons will fully investigate matters before engaging in any
enterprise. They will separate and arrange elements in their
appropriate order, and will cope capably with divergent views.
They will have the inherent qualities to be able to accomplish
their purposes.
Most auspicious: He will be highly respected, broad-minded
and impartial, and will have a natural attraction, drawing many
persons to him. He may be appointed to an important post, such
as a cabinet position, the president of a college, the head of a
religious or fraternal organization, or something similar.
Least auspicious: He will be an itinerant organizer with no
firm roots. He will probably leave his family circle and associate
mainly with his wife's family. He will travel extensively in his
profession. He may become a priest or a monk.

                               house.
Line2    Intimate   relationship with members of the clan.
Humiliation.

The persons depicted here are much sought after, but they are
weak in character. This is the single Yin line in the hexagram,
with which the five Yang lines all seek to unite. The second line
is a position of leadership in a hexagram. So these persons will
tend to be leaders, but having weak natures they will be adversely
affected by all the attention they receive. Many may be inclined
to use their natural ability for selfish purposes or in factions. Low
motives will naturally lead to humiliation. Furthermore, one
should always beware of the danger of being too intimate with
members of one's own clan. The tendency here to be too intimate
is a sign of weakness. Remember that members of the clan are
often more difficult to deal with than strangers. With care, the
possibility of humiliations can be avoided.
Most auspicious: He will be talented and will have wide
knowledge, but he will also have a tendency to be mean and
prejudicial. He may have a high and influential position in an
organization of limited scope.
Least auspicious: He will be influential to a minor degree, with a

                                               5   I   The Predictions
The truly superior man does not seek others, rather he waits and
lets others seek him. Therefore, those depicted here are likely to
be inferior, with perhaps a trace of cowardice and instability.
Also, mistrust may have replaced true fellowship. 'Three years'
relates to a cycle of events. These persons must endure and
progress through this cycle, learning to develop superior qualities.
Most auspicious: He will be a lover of eminence, no matter how
great or how small. He will mistrust others, which in turn will
cause them to mistrust him. He will vacillate in his goals, and
will be an inveterate worrier. He will not rise to a high position,
and his most likely employment will be in work of a hard nature.
Least auspicious: He will seek fellowship for the wrong reasons,
and will be an evil doer. He will not obey the law, but he will
run into disaster and be punished.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He is likely to make big mistakes,
                               and demotion is probable.
   Business and professional He will seek or obtain wrong
                               contracts or associations.
   Ordinary people             A difficult year. He may face law-
                               suits, and one of his parents may die.
Line 4 He climbs up on his protective wall. He cannot attack.
Good fortune.

Courage, common sense and strength are the dominant character-
istics here. The superior man reviews his situation and examines
himself to see if he has the adequate qualities for establishing
fellowship, and whether he should advance, or wait before
launching his plans. This man will have an intuitive sense of
what is right, and will maintain his goals and intentions even
under difficult situations. He will continue to develop himself
inwardly, so that his innate strength acts like a magnet and
draws the fellowship to him which he desires. This will result in
benefits and good fortune.
Most auspicious: He will know when to advance, when to wait,
and when to retreat. He will know what is right and the best
courses to pursue to attain his aims, and he will be satisfied with
what is attainable and not be greedy. He will be noble and may
become rich. He is likely at some time to be assigned to a high
position away from the seat of his career.

                                                                   145

Least auspicious: He will be able to advance, but will find it
difficult. He will be trusted and respected by his juniors and
seniors Alike, hut he will have much to learn. He will have a
~enerally good Iifo.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He will receive promotion, or be
                              awarded a title for merit.
   Business and professional A stable year, but with little chance
                              of any major gains.
   Ordinary people            With care and caution, this year
                              could be auspicious. Some suspicions
                              and disputes are likely.
Line 5 Men destined for fellowship first weep and cry; after-
wards they laugh. After great struggles they join together.

The key to establishing fellowship is depicted here. It is beautifully
expressed thus by Confucius. *
     Life leads the thoughtful man on a path of many windings.
     Now the course is checked, now it runs straight again.
     Here winged thoughts may pour freely forth in words,
     There the heavy burden of knowledge must be shut away in
       silence.
     But when two people are at one in their inmost hearts,
     They shatter even the strength of iron or of bronze.
     And when two people understand each other in their inmost
       hearts,
     Their words are sweet and strong, like the fragrance of
       orchids.
   These persons will be strong, purposeful, idealistic, persistent,
intelligent,  knowledgeable, warm-hearted,        considerate, and
willing to render service and nourishment to others.
Most auspicious: He will be a true gentleman and leader,
following the right way, talented, full of virtue and honor. He
will experience hardships at first, then later attain his goals, for
which he win achieve fame and profit. He will attain a high
position, and will execute his office successfully, as he will all
his enterprises .

Line 6 Fellowship in the countryside. No error or regret.

Fellowship in the country is not as wide as that in towns. This
indicates that the time for the greatest fellowship is past, but
that efforts towards fellowship, by those possessing qualities for
organization and leadership, should continue. The results will
he limited but the effort will be worth while, engendering no
error or regrets. These persons will have above average leadership
abilities, capable of persisting towards a desirable goal, and will
be able to act independently. They will be ambitious but not with
a compelling ambition, and will be content with whatever gains
they manage to make.
Most auspicious: He will be an intelligent, broad-minded
leader or organizer, of a noble and rich nature.
Least auspicious: He will become a monk, or person of similar
 activity in which fellowship is circumscribed.

Hexagram        [4   Ta    Yu::=::   Great Possessing (Amassing)


SIMPLE        TRANSLATION         OF TEXT
Great Possessing. Supreme success.

COMMENTARY
These auspicious persons are endowed with great perspicacity.
Light and clarity are above, with creative strength below. While
the previous hexagram represented fellowship and brotherhood
on earth, those born under this hexagram, through proper
development, can achieve much fellowship in spiritual matters.
Thus the creative power within these individuals expresses itself
in a graceful and cultured way. Possessing and amassing naturally.

follow the acquisition of great inner spiritual power. The
degree will vary, depending on the degree of spiritual develop-
ment. The path is not smooth or easy, and some set-backs may
occur. In general, those with this hexagram as their base will be
blessed "and will have a better than average life. This will come
from being in accord with heaven, and gladly carrying out
divine will, which is affirmed by love and goodness, and by the
curbing of evil.
   Those born in the first month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES    (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line   INo contact with evil. No blame. Realization of difficulties
ahead. He remains without fault.

The tyro is beginning to make progress. He is a man of culture,
learning now to seek a greater understanding of life, and the
universe. He has resolved not to associate with evil, which is
commendable, but he is only just beginning, and he will have to
face and overcome many practical difficulties. If he has a true
realization of the difficulties, he can remain without fault. Being
a tyro, his successes and failures will be determined by the
firmness of his resolve. He should recognize that in metaphysics
there is action and reaction, just as in physics.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of virtue, and very talented.
He should keep his spiritual strivings in the background, and
help others by generating profits which he then puts to altruistic
use. It is best for him not to seek fame.
Least auspicious: He may strive too high too soon and face
difficulties. He is likely to receive serious slanders. If conservative
and cautious, he can avoid troubles, or cope with them successfully
even in times of hardship.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official            He should wait or retreat until the
                                  right moment for action.

5   I   The Predictions
A favorable time and favored persons are indicated. Spiritual
wealth is available in great quantities. Persons knowing how to
draw on it can set forth on any enterprise in any direction and be
confident of success. It is most propitious if the goals chosen are
universal in nature, no matter how humble. While the spiritual
wealth is available it must be used as a blessing, and the more it is
used the less chance there is of error. Individuals with this
hexagram as their base will be found in various walks of life and
at many levels, but all will have the common purpose of striving
for good and for the improvement of the world.
Most auspicious: He will have great virtue and be very talented,
and he will establish great merit. He will be able to calm anarchy
and quell disorders, and he will have a good and beneficial life.
Least auspicious: He also will have a long life and great good
fortune, with no major worries or troubles. He may attain wealth.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will gain promotion or a new
                               position. If in a position of leader-
                                ship, he will win a victory (not
                                necessarily in war).
   Business and professional He can expect advancement in the
                               size of his organization, or in
                                status and reputation.
   Ordinary people              He will also gain in status and
                                possessions.

Line J The prince presents his offering to the emperor. An
ordinary man cannot do this.

'The Prince' symbolizes a man of superior talents, experience
and ability. Furthermore, this person is presented as being in the
right position to render service to his lord. An ordinary man is
insufficiently qualified to do this. These individuals will fare best
when their service includes service to mankind in addition to the
personal fealty depicted. Any attempts at taking over leadership
could be disastrous.
Most auspicious: He will act impartially, and he will be
virtuous and talented, possessing wide experience. He will not be
egotistic. This person's advice will be sought and followed, even
in matters affecting the nation.
                                              5 / The Predictions
Least auspicious: He may falter, and begin to work with
selfish motives. This could be disastrous. He will find it hard to
establish anything of lasting benefit.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will have important duties,
                              perhaps of national scope.

                               distinction.
   Ordinary people             He will have a dull year, with
                              possibly some trouble.
Line 4 Very discriminating. No error.

This person has an intuitive insight into nearly every situation.
The fourth line is the topmost position for man; here it is strong,
the lowest line of the trigram Li, clarity, and next to the ruler
of the hexagram, line 5. Lines 4 and 5 are of such a nature that
they work together favorably, hence this person knows his work
well, yet is cautious and guards against mistakes. Such a person
can, and should be, in a position of leadership, both in spiritual
and material matters. Regrettably, as a strong line is in
a weak place, these persons will have a tendency towards
ideal solutions which are not always practical in this material
world, or a tendency to use their unusual capabilities for selfish
purposes.
Most auspicious: He should be exceedingly careful at the
beginning of any enterprise to be sure that the seeds are rightly
sown and properly nurtured. He will exercise capable supervision,
so that the results are always propitious.
Least auspicious: He may be greedy regarding small things,
expressing some jealousy, and thereby cause trouble. He will
have difficulty in achieving his goals and in managing his
household successfully.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        A stable year, with troubles gradu-

Line 5 Exemplification of clarity and truth. Good fortune.
3   I   Tm Predictions
Leaders and rulers possessing sincerity, clarity and truth, who
rule majestically and set a good example to others, will experience
good fortune. These persons have found the right way, or tao,
in both the spiritual and material realms. They will be cultured,
well-mannered, intelligent, wise and discerning rulers, whom
others respect and try to emulate. This will result in much good
for all. Since this is a weak line in a strong position, not all these
persons will be successful, even though they will attempt to do
that which is right.
Most auspicious: He will be kind, magnanimous and just in
leadership, rewarding others graciously and freely. He will lead
with dignity and virtue, and will attain fame. He will be re-
spected and honored, and will communicate well with others.
Least auspicious: He will be disastrously unsuccessful, owing
to his inner self being inadequately developed, and not as clear
as it ought to be. He will reward graciously, but will be defamed
and insulted in return. He will do good for others, but will
receive complaints in return.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He should lead in a dignified
                                 manner but be ready to retreat if
                                 necessary.

   Ordinary people               He should act at the right moments.
                                 If he is flippant, proud or insincere,
                                 troubles will occur.
Line 6 Blessed and protected by heaven. Advantages and good
fortune.

The height of clarity, supported by heaven, is depicted here.
These persons will have the same fine attributes as those described
by line 5, but they will be even more highly favored, supported
and blessed by heaven. These persons will sincerely walk in
truth, and will be the devoted stewards of both material and
spiritual poss-essions;they will be a blessing to others.
Most auspicious: He will be valiant, devoted, reliable and
modest. His virtue and talents will be in accordance with the
will of heaven, which he will intuitively carry out throughout a
long, beneficial and rewarding life.

characteristics of individuals born under this hexagram. The hexa-
gram is made up of the youngest son, Ken, mountain, the
representative of heaven on earth, under (within) K'un, the
receptive, earth. The wealth of the mountain is hidden, yet it is
there to be taken and used at the right time. Also, soil from the
mountain is used to fill up the low places on the earth. Persons
with these qualities are found in all walks of life. They not only
strive to reduce fullness and to develop the modest, but they
carry out the will of heaven, which likewise favors modesty.
That is why the Chinese regard this characteristic so highly. It
is also why people everywhere love the modest, hating pride and
boastfulness. With modesty as a handle, a man can face any
difficulty with confidence.
   Those born in the ninth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING          LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line I Adding humility to modesty. One may cross the great
stream. Good fortune.

Self-disciplined persons readily exemplify modesty as a dominant
characteristic. Line 1 represents the beginnings of modesty.
Therefore, these persons would do well to add humility to
modesty in their early progress. If they do so, they will be able to
commence any enterprise, no matter how dangerous, and be
certain of good fortune. They should remember, however, that
good fortune frequently comes in a manner which at first seems
strange. Regrettably, line 1 is a weak line in a strong place. This
indicates that not all will be successful in the matter of appropriate
self-discipline.
Most auspicious: He will be modest and moral in behaviour.
He will be gentle in relations with others, and reverent to the
divine will. He will be trusted by his juniors and seniors alike. He
is able to change dangerous situations into safe circumstances, and
is likely to be in government or another high position of authority.
Least auspicious: He could be lazy. If so, his attempts to
advance will end in retreat. He may also be dull and stupid, and
content to remain in a low position.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official          He will be in a position to lead and
                                 guide many people.

Line 2 Expressed modesty is recognized. Highteous persistence
brings good fortune.

 Modesty is such an innate part of these individuals that others
 readily perceive it. This then is their inner int1uence, the
strength of which is such that lasting benefits will be derived
therefrom. Those born with this controlling line may be found
in nearly any walk of life. It is more than likely that they will
engage in a full or part-time activity of service to others.
Most auspicious: He will win fame and honors through his
talents, virtue, and his unselfish and honest thoughts and efforts.
 He is likely to be in a position where the guidance of others is
involved.
Least auspicious: He will also be recognized for his ability, and
will give assistance to others. He will have a good life.

                                not try to push forward.
Line J The superior man, by his merit. carries everything
through to conclusion. Good fortune.

These persons will be superior, full of virtue, and richly endowed
with noble traits. They will make good leaders, excellent
examples for others to follow, and will carry matters through to
conclusion. This will be easy for them since their character is of a
high and noble order, as well as being of a nature which auto-
matically attracts others, and is reflected in all that they do. They
will never begin anything they do not intend to finish, and they
will finish everything they begin. They will be intuitive and
beneficial leaders of others, and will be sought after by many.
Most auspicious: He will be able to assnme great responsibility

                                                                   155

and able to establish or control a successful organization. He will
have a deep sense of honor and justice, which he will exemplify
at all times. He may be very good at writing, especially in
dealing with worthy subjects in article or book form.
] .east auspicious: He will also be a noble person, but only
known and respected locally. He will be of help to others,
without seeking anything in return.
In yearly hexagram:
    For everyone               A very favorable year.
Line 4 Advantageous to cultivate and express modesty.

Modesty, like everything else, should be cultivated and expressed
in accordance with the golden mean, i.e. nothing should be done
to excess. This implies a strong nature, and one who knows both
what is right and the right time to act. These persons will have
the patience to wait, and the strength to retreat if necessary, to act
without impulsiveness, and to bring matters to the fore, often in
the face of possible adverse opinions or reactions. These persons
will be wise, practical, full of common sense, confident and
courageous.
Most auspicious: He will have great talent and virtue, and will
be respected by the high and the low alike. He will be honest and
sincere, and will promote matters of benefit to the community.
He may become highly respected and rich.
Least auspicious: He will be an upright person, and will
associate with, and be close to, good, intelligent and capable
people. He will exert considerable influence in his circle.
In yearly hexagram:
   For everyone                 A good year, passing smoothly, if
                                one remembers to be modest and
                                yielding; otherwise there may be
                                some trouble.
Line 5 Modest dealings with neighbors. Everything con-
tributes to success, even attacking with force (if necessary).

Noble, kingly rulers and leaders are symbolized. These persons
are wise and intelligent, and have great understanding of the
psychology of human nature. They respect their neighbors and
treat them as equals. They use modesty as their tool, rather than
rules, regulations and precepts, which control through punish-

ment and fear. They are strong, and know when to use their
strength advantageously for the assertion and (re)establishment
of justice, with the use of force only when necessary.
Most auspicious: He will be a leader who naturally attracts
other leaders and men of quality and ability. He will auto-
matically move people favorably, and his wishes will be carried
out readily. He will be a man of virtue and nobility, achieving
much honor and merit.
Least auspicious: He also will establish fame as a pioneer,
perhaps in a military career or in the field of literature. He will
help to overcome evil wherever he is, in many ways.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will hold, or be assigned to, an
                                influential position.
    Business and professional He will make gains in status,
                                reputation, and material possessions.
    Ordinary people             He will succeed with the help of
                                some noble person, and will gain
                                considerable profit. If he falters in
                                virtue he may have disputes.
 Line 6 Modesty disseminated. It is propitious to send one's
 army forth to subdue one's own country and cities.

As in hexagram 13, where universal brotherhood has not yet
been attained by line 6, here universal modesty has not yet
been attained. The injunction given is to begin with oneself, and
discipline every part of one's inner being, in order to establish
modesty as a virtue of one's wholeness. When this has been
achieved, it will be reflected externally and will be emulated by
others, and be a blessing to all who one comes in contact with.
These persons will have much modesty innately, but will need to
be diligent and cautious in their careers, to be sure that quality is
improved and quantity is used judiciously.
Most auspicious: He will be courageous and will carry out
tao (divine will). He will be ever diligent to improve his modesty,
and will express it in his leadership. He may have a career in the
Corps diplomatique, the military, or some peace-keeping agency.
Least auspicious: He will be able to maintain his household in
good order and condition on a modest scale, and at the same time
exercise modest influence .

SIMPLE       TRANSLATION         Ulo' TEXT
Broadcasting. The people are set in motion advantageously.
 • This hexagram is the opposite of hexagram 15, which was translated as
'Modesty.' Hexagram J 5 shows the proper characteristics to display from an
earthly point of view. Here in hexagram 16 we are dealing more with the
                                                        5   I   The Predictions

COMMENTARY
This hexagram principally represents thunder over the earth,
and movement over people. Thunder emanates from heaven and
is heard on earth. Chen, movement, the upper trigram, and
symbolic of heaven's actions, is above K'un, earth, representing
the people. The ancient kings used this situation to develop
special music to express reverence for the will and blessings of
heaven, and also to stir up and generate feeling in the people,
thereby controlling them either for peaceful or for warlike
purposes. The single Yang line; the ruler of the hexagram, is a
strong leader to whom the others are devoted. This produces
enthusiasm, tranquillity and repose. The upper trigram,
Thunder, sugge ts making sounds known to others. Hence
individuals with this hexagram as their base will make themselves
known to others, in varying ways according to their specific
controlling lines. These individuals will be found in nearly every
walk of life, with many being successful through understanding
and use of the principles of this hexagram, while others will be
failures through personal neglect.
   Those born in the fifth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING          LINES     (FROM     BOTTOM       TO TOP)
.Line   I   Boastfulness brings misfortune.

The modern expression for the kind of person depicted here is
'name dropper.' These persons brag about whom they know, and
use the knowledge and the fame of others egotistically, as if it
were their own. There is a definite lack of personal will power for
self-development and self-improvement. These people would
like to progress by riding on the coat-tails of others.
Most auspicious: He will receive some strength and help from
people in a higher position than himself, and will make some
gains. He can only make very small gains on his own.
Least auspicious: He will be very narrow-minded, a braggadocio,

spiritual realm, signified by heaven's creation and the manifestation of thunder.
This hexagram is the foundation for the use of music and words to influence
others. To us today, broadcasting most aptly describes the influencing of others
on a large scale through words and music. In other translations, Legge did not
assign a descriptive name to this hexagram. Wilhelm called it 'Enthusiasm,'
and Blofeld called it 'Repose.' It is, in fact, a combination of both.

                                                                             159

with self-destructive tendencies reflected in all his thoughts and
actions. He will have a poor family life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He will presume on being the
                              favorite of the leader or ruler.
   Business and professional He will make some astonishing
                              temporary gains.
   Ordinary people             He will have much worry and
                              some unpleasant surprises. Not a
                              very good year.
Line 2 Stable as a rock; not for a whole day. Righteous per-
severence brings good fortune.

Persons with this controlling line are wise and discriminating,
following the golden mean, stable and steadfast in their goals
and purposes. These persons will express their nobility through
lasting creativity, by writing influential books or music, painting
memorable works of art, creating poetry, etc. The words 'not for
a whole day' are symbolic of these persons never reaching the
end of their capacity. Their working in this manner for the right
reasons will result in good fortune.
Most auspicious: He will be active, quickwitted and communi-
cative. He will be diligent in all matters, especially in pursuit of
virtue, and will live by the golden mean. He will have a stable
character and disposition, unmoved by riches or poverty or
temptations. He will become noble, and will achieve fame.
Least auspicious: He will also be a person of good character,
and attain good fortune through modest accomplishments.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Remain steadfast. Wait for the
                                right time. If action is propitiously
                                taken he will gain fame.
   Business and professional An increase in profits can be
                                expected.
   Ordinary people              There will be gains in family,
                                status and possessions.
Line J To gaze enviously brings regret. Delayed action brings
remorse.

Line 3, a weak line in the wrong place, looks to its strong
160
                                               3 / The Predictions
neighbor, line 4, for care and support. He is weak and envious,
and would like to be provided for as if he were still a child. These
characteristics are predominant in persons having this controlling
line. They like possessions,status and respect, but are unwilling
to exert the necessary energy to attain them. They would like to
have these things presented to them. Additionally, they make
efforts to avoid responsibility while seeking love, pity and care
from others. They do not understand the principle that to give is
to receive. Procrastination and failure to teke action in a timely
manner brings remorse. Fortunately, many of these persons
recognize these traits in themselves, and consequently repent
and reform, thereby overcoming their deficiencies.
Most auspicious: He will be faced with many obstacles as a
result of his own attitude and can accomplish but little. If he
reforms himself he will achieve a reasonably satisfactory life in
his later years.
Least auspicious: He will vacillate continually in his ambitions
and work habits. He will have no worthy achievements, but
many worries and troubles.
In yearly hexagram:
   For everyone                 On the whole, plans will fail.
                                There will be many fluctuations.
                                It is best not to try and advance,
                               but hold as firm and as stable as
                                possible.
Line 4 From the fountain great results accumulate. Be con-
fident. Friends readily gather round.

The advice, guidance, example, and control of a true, dynamic
and communicative leader are a fountain from which great
results can be achieved and blessings derived. Every age in
history develops such persons when they are needed. It should be
remembered here that I Ching is designed for superior persons
as a guide to self-development. It can, however, reflect and
symbolize others who are not striving for the good of humanity.
Among those are leaders who are egotistical, factional and
selfish. These are equally discernible. All leaders have difficulties
at one time or another, and conditions are never smooth for a
great leader. In fact, it is the manner in which they overcome
impediments that makes for their greatness. Every leader
                                                                 161

probably wavers on occasion, when difficulties are truly immense.
But by being confident he is able to carry out his will, and gather
others spontaneously to him. Everybody likes a winner, and
those depicted here are winners.
Most auspicious: He will be in a powerful and influential
position, and will exercise his responsibilities judiciously and
dynamically. He will carry out great enterprises, and will estab-
lish virtue and achieve merit. He will have great good fortune.
Least auspicious: He will also be a reputable man, of virtue and
good fortune. He will be respected and sought after, both
personally and professionally. He will have an exceptionally
harmonious domestic life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will advance to fame, and will
                               be recommended for a higher
                               position.
   Business and professional He will establish a favorable repu-
                               tation, and become a leader in his
                               field.
   Ordinary people             He will make substantial profits.

Line 5      Chronic illness. No death.

Line 4 is so strong that in its efforts to advance it puts much
pressure on the weak line above it. This incessant pressure is like
an illness. There is no let-up, so that these persons have little
time for anything other than work and solving problems. Since
the position of the line is central there is a possibility of some
successes. There will be many periods of fluctuation, but never
complete failure or disaster. Chronic illness also suggests a lack of
adequate preparations. These persons will be involved in much
hustle and bustle, with much talk and many attempts to exert
influence on others. They will have few firm and lasting
accomplishments.
Most auspicious: He will be pressured by himself and others,
and will be involved in much activity .. Many times he will find
his efforts hampered and delayed for no apparent reason. H
truly auspicious, he may become known through the support and
efforts of others. He may have a long life, but will probably be
ill much of the time.

   Ordinary people           He will not be able to accomplish his
                             goals. He may have a serious illness.
Line 6 Confused, Wasted efforts. Change can take place. No
blame.

Line 6 is the height of the thunder in the heavens, and con-
sequently striving upward produces no effect on earth. Efforts in
this direction are confused and wasted. If the thunder finds some
 way to change its direction, such as being reflected by a sound
barrier, it still can be heard on earth. This symbolizes persons
who strive too high without the proper background, who are
not clear in their goals or are too idealistic in trying to influence
others. They cannot achieve sound results. If they become aware
of their deficiencies they can reform, with an expectancy of
greater subsequent effectiveness, Such a sober awakening frees
them from blame.
Most auspicious: He will make mistakes, but will listen to sound
advice and reform without bearing grudges. If the new courses are
continued for long enough he will make some gains and profits.
Least auspicious: He will have no lasting achievements. Even
if he gains prosperity by a lucky chance, he will probably lose
it later, and end his life in sorrow.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be blamed for decay or
                                corruption, and is likely to be
                                demoted.
   Business and professional He will suffer defamations and
                                insults.
   Ordinary people              He may suffer from disputes and
                                lawsuits, but if he reforms and
                                follows a virtuous path, mistakes
                                can be avoided.

Following. Supreme success. Persistence in the correct and the

COMMENTARY
In this hexagram we have Chen, movement, led by Tui, joy,
a condition which automatically produces a following. Chen is
the beginning of spring, so it is a time of joyous progress. In
addition, this hexagram shows the completion of a cycle, in that
Chen, thunder (as well as movement), is below Tui, lake. The
fall is therefore indicated by the thunder returning within the
earth. Consequently, we have a cycle of service beginning with
a joyous movement and ending with a time of rest. If one

considers this hexagram as symbolic of the course of a day, then
the superior man is active during the hours of light and at
nightfall rests and recuperates. These persons will primarily
have daytime careers wherein they render service to others. The
more service they render, the greater will be their following.
Persistence in being firm and correct in their actions will
produce supreme success without error. The keynote here is
rendering service.
   Those born in the seventh month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING      LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line I Authorities subject to change. Persistence in right ways.
Go out in public and mingle freely. Substantial results.

Flexibility, persistence in virtue, open-mindedness, a nsmg
above selfish motives, and an absence of preconceived opinions
are the dominant characteristics of these persons. Such individuals
keep abreast of the changing times and are eclectic in their
studies and ideas. They know that merely having knowledge is
not sufficient in itself. Others must be nourished as well as
additional personal illumination being sought. Hence, these
persons go out among the public in their careers of service. As a
result of their joyous and energetic actions they naturally acquire
a following. Knowledge and service makes for influence and
power.
Most auspicious: He will be a noble person of great virtue,
wisdom, energy and talent. He will be able to lead, and to quell
even major calamities in his nation. He will be highly respected.
Least auspicious: He will be a similar person to the most
auspicious, but to a lesser degree. He will establish some merit
and achievements, but may need the support of powerful and
influential persons to attain his aims.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         A change to a more influential
                               position is indicated.

Line 2 He who follows a boy loses a superior man.
:5 / The Predictions
Individuals who have inferior goals and put forth only minimal
effort will never become superior. Such persons have a tendency
to be lazy, and to procrastinate, and accomplish only that which
is forced upon them. Such persons might go to college or a
technical school, and, after leaving, never again pick up a text
containing new material relating to their field. They will come
in contact with virtue and ambition, but will not possess the
courage to pursue these qualities very far on their own. They
will, on the whole, be followers all their lives.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of little talent, prone to
vacillation. He may be close to persons following the primrose path.
Least auspicious: He will be a laborer or servant. Women may
become concubines.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He should hold firm or retreat.
   Business and professional He should analyze his own actions
                                carefully, and know when to ad-
                                vance and when to retreat.
   Ordinary people              Not a peaceful year. There will be
                                many troubles, and he may even
                                face being jailed.
Line}     He who follows the superior man loses the boy. He
gains what he desires through following firm and correct
courses and goals.

In general, the conditions and situation are the opposite of
those set forth in line 2. Those depicted here are constantly
seeking new knowledge and new ways to be of service to others.
Their degree of success is largely determined by the intelligence
with which they are endowed. They will be independent persons
to whom additional duties and responsibilities can be assigned,
with reliance on their appropriate fulfilment.
Most auspicious: He will complete everything he begins, with
some dep;ree of success i 11 all matters. He will be assisted by those
of higher status or position, hut will receive negligible help from
subordinates. He should beware of impatience, be cautious and
thorough, and avoid mean people.
Least auspicious: He will achieve some substantial results,
from which local fame and profit may arise. His children,
regrettably, will not be dependable.

second in command. To generate and develop a following for its
own sake, or for ulterior motives, would be a grievous mistake. If
such persons recognize what is taking place they can, primarily
through their sincerity, convert their personal following into a
loyal following for their leader, ruler or cause. Acting in this
manner is a true rendering of service both to his leader, whom
he thus serves correctly, and to the subordinates, since then
everything is in proper order. What error or harm can develop
if such a course is followed? The greater the wisdom and the
greater the loyalty of the minister, the greater the overall
success.
Most auspicious: He is sincere, upright and virtuous, following
the true tao. His seniors and juniors alike repose confidence and
trust in him. He will be kind, considerate and non-dictatorial.
T Ie will be highly successful in all that he undertakes.
Least auspicious: He will do well as long as he remains im-
personal. Personal involvement, and the seeking of gain for
selfish reasons can lead to serious trouble. lIe may be reprimanded
frequently by his seniors, and his juniors may become suspicious
of him. He is likely to be an inveterate wanderer in his field of
work.

Line 5 Sincere towards universal good. Good fortune.

Genuine, unaffected sincerity should be exercised in the rendering
of service to others, by fostering and promoting matters for
universal good. These persons exemplify the meaning of the
hexagram as a whole. To fulfil this they must be dedicated to the
service of mankind, in keeping with divine will. They will be
wise, intuitive, judicious, communicative and intelligent, blessed
with common sense, practicality and inexhaustible energy.
They will be men of vision.
Most auspicious: He will be a wise person of great virtue, who
likes to communicate and associate with superior men. He will
know inwardly that he has a great mission to accomplish, and
will persistently and consistently strive to achieve it. He may
earn a large salary and be in a high position.
Least auspicious: He will also be a good man, but to a lesser
degree. The golden mean will be the rule in his life.
 In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will enjoy promotion.

 Line 6 Firm allegiance. Adherents cling to him. He accom-
 panies the king in sacrifice on the Western Mountain.

Symbolized in this line are leaders, teachers and sages, who
desire to withdraw from worldly affairs. They are good people
who have achieved much in life, and their followers wish to
remain with them. The king's sacrifice at the Western Mountain
was a ceremony in which the king worshipped God, and paid
reverence to his ancestors in the highest degree. It was the
highest form of worship of the ancient kings. To be invited to
participate was an honor symbolizing the granting of equal
status to the individual concerned. These persons will be innately

noble and good, but will not have a strong desire to participate
in the affairs of the world. Their natural inclination is more
towards spiritual matters, and they devote a great portion of
their time to developing and improving themselves inwardly.
Status, position and wealth mean very little to such persons.
Most auspicious: He will be honest, sincere, gentle, merciful,
following righteous ways. His personality will automatically
move people. His aims can be attained, but, in general, these
are simple and non-demanding. In his cultivation he can
communicate with heaven, and invite good fortune.
Least auspicious: If he lives in seclusion, in the mountains or
in the forest, he will have a good and auspicious life. If he tries to
enter worldly affairs he will encounter difficulties.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Hold back, and hold firm. Beware
                                of misrepresentations.

Hexagram          18 Xu   ==    Decay (Correcting)


SIl\ll'I.I<:   TRANSLATION      OF TF.XT
Correcting decay augurs sublime success. Advantageous to
Crossthe great stream. Three days before beginning. Three days
after beginning.

COMMENTARY
This hexagram has the trigram Sun, wind, at the foot of Ken,
the mountain. The foot of the mountain is where things collect
and stagnate. Therefore this hexagram is symbolic of stirring up
decay and making corrections. Since I Ching is a guide for indi-
vidual development, the statements in the controlling lines
relating to correction of the mistakes of the father and mother
have reference partly to the characteristics inherited from one's
ancestors. This is representative of but another step in man's
never-ending growth. The symbolism applies to other situations,
such as family life, government and business, and wherever the
old must be cast out before the new can enter. It is advantageous
to set forth and work on such matters, but important steps
should not be taken lightly nor hastily. 'Three days before
beginning' and 'Three days after beginning' enjoin this man to
thoroughly study changes in advance and to follow through after
their initiation with proper care and nourishment, so that the
changes develop in a propitious manner and the seeds sprout into
productive growth. Individuals with this hexagram as their
base will be constantly involved in matters of correction, both
great and small, i.e. in the household, in the community, in
business, in states and in nations. For many this will include
spiritual as well as material matters.
   Most of those born under this hexagram will build their life out
of meager or hard beginnings. Some may inherit a household,
 but they will find it difficult to maintain. Many will not get
on with their parents. Those born in the last two months of the
year will be less auspicious, while those born in the first month
will be more auspicious.

there is no residue of blame on the father. Perilous conditions
end in good fortune.

Great corrections are not required here, so even though they may
be considered perilous they can be readily accomplished, and
result in good fortune. No one and nothing is perfect here on
earth. There are always possibilities for improvement, even
when the conditions are good, when corruption exists. Persons
with this controlling line will gravitate to positions requiring
their special qualities and talent to bring about reforms in a
propitious manner.
Most auspicious: He will. cultivate virtue and know how to
rectify mistakes. He will have the courage to advance with
deliberate and determined action. He will be loyal to his parents
and country. He is able to work through danger, and his
character and conduct will be a model for future generations.
Least auspicious: He will be independent of his family and
relations. He will fight through hardships, for accomplishment
rather than for glory or personal gain, and he will be modestly
successful.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be assigned to a pOSItIOn

                              include recognition for written
                               efforts.
   Ordinary people             A modest year for most. Older
                              persons may die.
Line 2 Making corrections for the mistakes of the mother. One
should not go to extremes.

Persons in such positions as vice-president, special assistants,
head of departments, etc., are symbolized here. They will render
full support to their superior, 01' or~allizatioJ), through diligence,
talent, loyalty and obedience. They <Ire well-qualified persuus,
who merit the positions they occupy. They are endowed with
souuil judgment and common sense, and they ad wisely,

Most auspicious: He is greatly talented, and exemplifies the

golden mean, with sincerity. He employs correct measures, well
thought out in advance. He will improve his home situation, his
enterprises, and his country. Opulence is not predicted but he
may become moderately wealthy.
Least auspicious: He will also be a good man working hard for
the improvement of his household, his undertakings, and his
country. He will attain modest results.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        His position will be stable. He will
                             clear away old business and useless
                              matters.
   Business and professional He will render loyal support, as
                             well as instituting modest changes
                              and corrections.
   Ordinary people            He will do something special for his
                             parents. He may correct himself,
                             or start something new.
Line J Handling mistakes of the father. There may be some
regret. No great blame.

Whenever one tries to make corrections too hastily and with too
much intensity, unfavorable reactions set in; but some corrections
need to be made quickly and acting in such a manner is not
subject to great blame. Persons acting thus will tend to be
impatient, and intolerant towards those who act in ignorance or
from stupidity, and especially with those who make errors when
they should know better. These persons are clever enough to see
what needs to be done, and courageous enough to carry it out,
even when occasionally there is opposition, or when it involves
stepping on the toes of others. When they act for themselves they
believe that being right is sufficient in itself.
Most auspicious: He is courageous and determined to do what
he knows should be done, with a disregard for consequences,
either for himself or for others involved along the way. He
readily rectifies his own mistakes, and those of others. He will
have strong friends and strong enemies, and will have a good
and auspicious life, without losses.
Least auspicious: He will also be cow'ageous and effective, but
will face many hardships early in life. Conditions will improve
slowly later.

In yearly hexagram:

                            cause regret later.
  Business and professional Study and caution are presaged.

Line 4 Tolerating troubles caused by the father. Weakness in
going forward. Humiliation.

The controlling line here is a weak line in a weak posrnon,
indicating that these persons have neither the strength nor the
ability to correct the decay and corruption they see. Such persons
are wise enough to discern difficulties and errors, and may bring
them to the attention of others. They will talk about them freely,
but cannot shoulder their own responsibility in connection with
them. They are mentally, morally, and physically weak and
lazy. They let things run their own course if others do not take
action.
Most auspicious: Although talented, he is easily dispirited and
lacking in fortitude. He will not have any major achievements.
Least auspicious: He is lackadaisical, jealous and suspicious,
with many vacillations and worries. He may be successful in
small matters, but cannot handle big enterprises.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be blamed for inactivity.
   Business and professional It would be a mistake not to keep
                               up to date.

Line 5 Correcting and restoring conditions which are inherited
wins praise.

Wise, energetic, courageous, patriotic and loyal persons who
carry out the will of their leader, and who govern enterprises,
government agencies, or political parties, judiciously and
effectively, are depicted here. To such persons the successful
accomplishment of their mission, especially in those matters
which benefit a great number of people, is far more important

                                                               175

than any gain or personal reward that might be attainable. They
are truly altruistic and unselfish.
Most auspicious: He will be far superior to the average person,
possessing great virtue, talent and personality. He will establish
great merit in the world, and have a beneficial and richly
rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will be a superior man, and effective, but
only in a local way.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will gain promotion to an
                                honorable position, and will attain
                               some fame.
   Business and professional He will achieve success in his
                               ventures, and a favorable reputa-

                                size of his family.
Line 6 He does not serve kings and nobles. He serves loftier
purposes.

Self-correction and self-improvement at the highest levels are
indicated. The results are not used selfishly, nor in public affairs,
but rather for universal matters and goals. Such persons have
progressed beyond participation in the mundane, and will live
in relative seclusion while working for the benefit of man-
kind.
Most auspicious: Although he is noble, talented and dynamic,
with great virtue, he will live and work creatively in seclusion,
rather than engage in public affairs. His efforts will benefit
mankind as a whole.
Least auspicious: He is also a man of high virtue and noble
character who prefers to follow his own way, apart from the
customs and practices of ordinary life. He will derive much
satisfaction from his work.

   Officer or official         He will probably retire, or with-
                               draw almost entirely from public

Hexagram 19       Lin    =-    Approach

      Tui, also indicates joy, and its movement is upward toward K'un,
      or the people, which trigram tends to move downward. A third
      symbol of approach is in the depiction of the time of the year
      when the Yang is trying to enter from the bottom and push
      upward. This is augmented by the lower inner trigram, Chen,
      movement, pushing upward into, and blending with, K'un,
      people, the upper inner trigram. Thus the persons symbolized
      here have great strength and depth, and are willing to teach,
      care for, and support others. The persons described by the three
      lower lines are rising to power and influencing those above them,
      while those described by the upper three lines use their strength
      primarily in support of those below them. Since the reservoir is
      huge, this indicates inexhaustible nourishment for the earth and
      the people, from those who dispense it. Nothing hinders these
      persons in the caring for and protection of the people. Such a
      time is truly great. 'In the eighth month' cautions one to re-
      member that the law of change is always operative.
         Those born in the twelfth month will be more auspicious.

      Line     I   Mutual Approach. Righteous persistence brings good
      fortune.

      Lines 1 and 2 work together, cooperating in their movement
      upwards. They are thus far stronger and more effective in their
      total effort than if working on their own. It is the work of the
      positive and the creative for the purpose of establishing good.
      These are the teachers in all walks of life who help, guide,
      support, protect and care for others at all levels. Some of them

Line 2 Joint Approach. Good fortune. Everything advantageous.

Line 2 is the leader of the united approach of lines 1 and 2, but
is a strong line in a weak place and hence not as favorable as line 1,
yet quite strong and active. As the leader and the more advanced
this person has greater and more important matters to deal with
than his partner, but some opposition is indicated. His principal
characteristics are wisdom, courage and fortitude.
Most auspicious: He will be diligent and will cultivate intelli-
gence and virtue, following the right path and the golden mean.
He will be able to control violence and correct it with humane-
ness. He is easily able to cope with adverse situations and
conditions. He desires to establish good, and to leave the world in
 a better state than that in which he finds it.
 Least auspicious: He will also be a fine and worthy person with
 much courage and a strong personality. He will advance house-
 hold and external enterprises propitiously and profitably.

 Line}     Volitional approach. Not advantageous to set forth ..
 With reflection, no error.

The position of this line is such that the way seems clear ahead;
one has the upward support of the Yang line underneath. These
persons recognize that there are many ways to go and innumerable
things to be done. This can easily produce over-confidence, along

with careless and relaxed moods in dealing with others. It is not
advantageous to set forth on matters relating to approach with
such attitudes. nflOectioll permits one to select a finn (!;oill and a

«rror. Regreltahly, this is a weak line ill il strong position, so
great things nre not accomplished. These persons will he know-
ledgeable in their fields, and will be able to communicate well
with others, especially in imparting their knowledge.
Most auspicious: He will know how to correct and compensate
for losses and mistakes. He will be a capable guide but not too
strong in leadership. He will have a good position, such as being
a director in the educational field, or some other major enter-
prise.
Least auspicious: He will use his knowledge and talents for evil
purposes. He will use flattery, and become a confidence trickster,
cheating people. In later life he will reap just reward for
his efforts, by experiencing many setbacks and considerable
sorrow.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be bothered by the mistakes

                               and grief.
Line 4 Mature approach. No error.

The upper trigram, K'un, has the tendency to sink, thus sym-
bolizing that the approach of these persons will be carried out by
using their power and strength to influence those below them.
Hence a mature approach is necessary if no error is to be
occasioned. These persons will be calm, poised, knowledge-

All the noble and virtuous qualities, of wisdom, justice and
executive ability, thought to have been held and exercised by the
three early Emperors, Fu Hsi, Shen Nung and Huang Ti, can

Lint'. 6 High-minded approach. Good fortune. No errol'.

The persons depicted here are beyond striving for the physical
nourishment, support and care of others, and are seeking to
improve the moral and spiritual values of individuals and the
nation. These persons are wise and use the best means for

                                                              179

Hexagram    20   Kuan.    =-=   Contemplation


SIMPLE     TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
The ablution has been made but not the sacrifice. He is reverenced
with sincerity.

COMMENTARY
This hexagram shows Sun, the wind, blowing over K'un, the
earth. It also represents 'penetration' over 'people,' hence the
concept of contemplation, or looking down over the people to see
what effects have been produced. At the same time, the people
look up to observe the manifestations of those above them. The
symbol of all this is the ancient sacrifice. The persons depicted
here are found in many walks of life and at various levels of
understanding. All of them have found certain keys to success,
i.e. through contemplation of the effects they produce on those
below them and on those above them. It is by these effects that
they can judge their success or failure, and begin to know the
seeds of the future. From these observations they establish rules
and guidelines for their actions. They tend to be active, judicious,
courageous, analytical and ambitious, to varying degrees,
largely dependent on their experience and intelligence. They are
respected for the successesthey attain. Among the more successful,
one will find diplomats, lawyers, doctors, researchers and
politicians.
   Those born in the eighth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES    (FROM   BOTTOM       TO TOP)
Line   I A youthful point of view is blameless in the ordinary
person, but blameworthy in the superior man.

Here, at the beginning of contemplation, are persons who have
insufficient talent, experience, character, intelligence or common
sense to make correct observations and formulate judicious
opinions. Thus their courses of action are not the best. This is not
their fault, but rather it is because their innate endowments are
limited. All types of individuals are required in this world, and
these, too, serve a useful purpose in their own way.
Most auspicious: He can learn but little academically, or from
                                                                 181

experience. He is able, however, to support himself and his
family.
Least auspicious: He has a mean and base character, and is short-
sighted, niggardly and ineffective in nearly everything he does.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He will find himself in a difficult
                              position, with his hands tied.
   Business and professional Wait or retreat this year. Do not
                              commence any major enterprises.
   Ordinary people            Judiciousness is lacking, and many
                              things will tend to go wrong.
                              Beware of evil people.
Line 2 Observing through a cracked door. Advantageous to
WOOlen.


Looking out from behind a cracked, or partially open, door
indicates that this person has a limited and narrow field of view
and, consequently, a 'restricted viewpoint.' Also, he likes to
operate secretly and unobserved. As noted under Hexagram 15
(and others), the most propitious way of operating is through
fellowship in the open. There are some circumstances where
secrecy and a limited outlook are advantageous when considered
in the light of their ancient role. Men with this controlling line
will tend to be opinionated, narrow-minded, limited in intelli-
gence, and restricted in abilities.
Most auspicious: He will be a person of little virtue and
meager talent. He will probably be stupid or ugly and in a low
position. He will have a tendency to blame others for his mistakes,
and because of jealousy will 'take it out on others,' to compensate
for his own deficiencies. He may receive help from a noble or rich
woman. Women can expect a much longer life than men.
Least auspicious: He will have similar traits to the most
auspicious, but will be poor and live in miserable conditions.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be regretful of his inability
                                to accomplish anything worth-
                                while.
   Business and professional He will be limited by the scope and
                                precision of his materials, and
                                their value.
                                               5   I   The Predictions
  Ordinary people            Women will experience more joy
                             than men. There will be uncertain-
                             ties over gains and losses. Avoid
                             difficult business methods and
                             transactions.
Line}    Analyzing own life determines advance or retreat.

Childishness and narrow points of view have been outgrown,
 and here one contemplates one's own life (and the biographies of
others, to determine their value and application) for the establish-
 ment of the guide lines one wishes to use and the direction in
which one elects to go. This is a continuous process. These per-
sons never do anything without a reason. Spontaneity is lacking
throughout their lives, often to the irritation of others. These
persons would do well in business, industry and government, in
 assignments involving research and analysis.
Most auspicious: He will begin to cultivate all phases of his life,
 especially the mental and moral aspects. He will know when to
 act and when to hold back or retreat. He will exercise wisdom
 and have many accomplishments of merit, and his life will be
smooth with virtually no hindrances.
Least auspicious: He will advance and retreat throughout his
life. This will be due in part to external conditions, and in part
to his own vacillations. He will face many hardships.
 In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official         There will be much uncertainty,
                                with both advances and set-backs.
    Business and professional He will suffer much competition,
                                with others often having the
                                advantage.
    Ordinary people             There will be uncertainties over
                                gains and losses. Avoid difficult
                                business matters.
 Line 4 Contemplating conditions of the kingdom. It is pro-
 pitious to be the guest of the king.

Cultivated and knowledgeable persons are depicted here. In
ancient times (in the Confucian era, c.500 B.C.) kings sought new
wisdom and enlightenment from visiting scholars and dignitaries.
They often changed the methods of governing their realms on the
                                                                   185
5   I   The Predictions
advice of such people. The persons depicted here are capable of
giving sound advice to the leaders of realms and enterprises.
Their vision is much broader than that of those in line 3. They
contemplate and analyze kingdoms as well as individuals, to
obtain their guide lines, and they are naturally communicative
persons as well. Since the controlling position in this hexagram is
line 4, these people are likely to be found in cabinet posts, on
boards of governors, and in legislative positions rather than
executive.
Most auspicious: He will be an important personage in govern-
ment or big business, capable of shouldering great responsibilities
with sagacity. He will be faithful and loyal to his God, his
country and its leaders, his duties, and his family.
Least auspicious: He is also a talented man, achieving merited
fame. He will be respected, and duly rewarded for his efforts.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will find himself in, or be
                               assigned to, a lofty position.
   Business and professional He will advance. He may partici-
                              pate in a renowned convention,
                              seminar or workshop.
   Ordinary people             An auspicious year for doing busi-
                              ness. Profits are to be expected.
Line 5 The superior man contemplates his own life, and the
lives of others.

The persons depicted here recognize that the greatest good COmes
from being a worthy example, and bringing benefits to, others.
While being interested in the realm as a whole, he knows that
real accomplishments and advancements come from and through
people. A nation or business Can temporarily achieve much by
executive action alone, but for truly great achievements, what is
done must be a part and parcel of the people's will.
Most auspicious: He will be a gracious, wise, considerate,
beneficent ruler or leader, setting high standards through
personal example and excellence. He will strive to eliminate
injustices, and to raise the virtue of the people as a whole. He will
work for and serve others, even though he is a ruler or leader.
Least auspicious: He will also be a good and just leader, with a
long and fruitful life.

  Business and professional He will create and promote material
                            for the benefit of others. He may
                            receive some accolades.
  Ordinary people           It will be a good year. He will work
                            with the cooperation of others. If

                            will recover.
Line 6 Contemplation of his inner self. No blame.

The highest contemplation (in consonance with the position of
the line) is that of one's inner self, whereby one recognizes one's
oneness with the Creator, and that therefore the inner self is that
which controls external conditions. These persons are sages, who,
for the most part, are beyond mundane matters and matters of
the ego. They tend to disguise their personal virtue and abilities,
and lead and guide indirectly, letting others receive the praise
and the credit. There is no blame attached to them for choosing
this type of behavior. They inspire others to take actions that
they know will bring benefits to many. They also achieve their
purposes through literature, art and music.
Most auspicious: He will be a sage person and will be venerated.
He will be a model of virtue, and will do much for the benefit of
mankind.
Least auspicious: He will also be a model of virtue, but in
seclusion or within a religious or altruistic organization.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He should exercise introspection
                                for the benefit of his mission.
   Business and professional He will not be satisfied with present
                                conditions, but will find the ad-
                                vancement of new ideas difficult.
   Ordinary people               It will be a dull year. However,
                                long-term illnesses will be cured,
                                and those who are pregnant will
                                 have an easy birth.

ulterior motives or desire for personal gain. In this way one can
overcome karma, if that is what one wishes.


Hexagram       2I   Shih Ho   ==      Gnawing Through


SIMPLE       TRANSLATION       OF TEXT
Gnawing through. Success. The time is favorable for the enforce-
ment of justice.

COMMENTARY
Lightning is above thunder; clarity is above movement. The air
is clear, the life of nature renewed; tensions are released, and
beauty is restored once more, after a thunderstorm. This
hexagram symbolizes the gnawing through of obstacles and
adverse conditions. To do this, rulers and leaders must initiate,
disseminate and enforce proper laws, vigorously and firmly. The
three lower lines refer, on the whole, to people who need to
correct themselves or be corrected, while lines 4 and 5 symbolize
186
                                                 5   I   The Predictions
how correction should be made. Line 6 reflects the completion
of the cycle, with conditions reverting to their opposite. Persons
depicted by this hexagram may be in a legal career, or involved
with legal matters, in any ofthe three fields, legislative, executive
and judicial, as determined hy their controlling line and rlegree of
auspiciousness.
   Those born in the ninth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING        LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line   I   His feet are in the stocks. Toes now are useless. No error.

When a person first transgresses, making small mistakes, he
should be corrected and punished mildly but appropriately so
that he will stop making mistakes, big or small. In this way no
blame or error will occur. Every hexagram, through the changing
of lines can change into any other hexagram, and it is to be
noted that a complete change here would bring about a condition
of rapid progress (hexagram 35). This is the most auspicious
possibility here, and implies that those born with this controlling
line will tend to be audacious, to violate rules, and to enjoy
skirting authority. Some may be in high positions, others in low,
but by changing their traits and habits, and by using their
talents for the purpose of furthering good, they can make
excellent progress.
Most auspicious: He will know how to, and will, take pre-
cautions to avoid troubles and mistakes. He will correct his own
faults through the energetic cultivation of virtue. He will prob-
ably start life in poor or humble circumstances, which will
gradually improve to an average, and then well above average,
standard. He will become a noble person.
 Least auspicious: He will be a mean and cowardly person, who
fails in nearly every endeavor to advance.
 In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Demotion of some sort is likely.
   Business and professional Efforts at promotion fail. Hold back.
   Ordinary people              He should beware of serious illness;
                                and he may be punished or put in
                                jail. Caution can prevent most
                                difficulties.
Line 2 Gnaws through soft flesh. Nose disappears.
5   I   The Predictions
Whatever these people do is like biting through soft flesh, but it
may be for right purposes or for wrong ones. The nose dis-
appearing could mean, in ancient times, either that the meat was
soft so that one's nose disappeared into it when eating a large
piece, using one's hands to hold it, or, that this was the punish-
ment an offender received, i.e, to have his nose cut off for some
transgression. The lower trigram is 'movement,' and a change
in this line would convert it into 'joy.' Here, too, one could be
seeking the right kind of joy or the wrong kind, depending on
one's character, intelligence and motives.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of good character, ambitious
and talented. He may become an officer in the military, or some
law enforcement agency, either in the apprehension or punish-
ment of transgressions. He will carry out his responsibilities well.
Least auspicious: He may use his talents for wrong purposes,
with bad results. He could become a cripple, and will face many
troubles and hardships. It would be best for him to become a monk
or a recluse.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be hurt, physically or in
                               reputation, by tough persons who
                               are hard to govern or manage.
   Business and professional New efforts at advancement and
                               promotion will fail.
   Ordinary people             It will be hard to advance or
                               retreat. There are likely to be
                               many illnesses in the family.
Line}     Gnawing on dried meat. Strikes tainted portion. Some
indisposition. No blame.

If one were strong and in the right position one would be eating
fresh meat and not dried meat, so old that some of it is apparently
spoiled. This is symbolic of not governing properly, and having
difficulties with people through insubordination. This is primarily
the result of insufficient clarity and foresight, which are the
characteristics that this man must seek in order to achieve a more
auspicious life. If this is done, then his efforts and accomplish-
ments will be without blame.
Most auspicious: He will tend to be low in intelligence and
talent, but very ambitious. He will probably fail to recognize his
188
                                                  3   I   The Predictions
weaknesses, and consequently have but few achievements.
Self-improvement is needed.
Least auspicious: He will be less adequately talented than the
most auspicious. He will find it very hard to advance and develop
professionally, and to support himself and his family.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be criticized severely for
                               not being adequately qualified for
                               the position he holds.
   Business and professional Lack of facilities and capabilities
                               will prove damaging.
   Ordinary people             There will be considerable troubles,
                               and possible disaster.
Line 4 Gnawing on dried gristly meat. Receives metal arrows.
Determination in spite of difficulties. Good fortune.

A strong person, in the position of an arbiter or executive who has
to try to administer justice in difficult legal situations, is depicted.
In olden days such persons received metal and arrows before they
adjudicated matters. Therefore these persons have the innate
ability to be great and noble in fulfilling such duties. Gristly
meat signifies that very serious and entangled matters are under
consideration, yet through talent, wisdom, courage and deter-
mination, these can all be decided correctly, and good fortune
will result.
Most auspicious: He will be a highly competent and courageous
individual, who can be assigned to even the highest judicial
positions in the nation, and will carry out his duties and re-
sponsibilities in a firm and beneficial manner. His personal life
will be on a high level too.
Least auspicious: He will have considerable wealth and perhaps
a good position, but will be subject to graft and corruption.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be promoted.
   Business and professional His reputation and effectiveness
                                will be enhanced.
   Ordinary people              He will make a good profit in his
                                business or work.
Line 5 Gnawing on choice dried meat. Meets piece of gold.
Aware of dangerous position. No error.
5   I   The Predictions
This is the ruling position for this hexagram, and also the center
of the trigram 'clarity.' Rulers and leaders must overcome
difficulties and mistakes, as well as correcting others. Choice meat
indicates a large and potentially favorable enterprise. The gold
indicates that this man should be mild and pure like gold in his
rulings. It further signifies that the people do not readily submit
to him. He must carefully discern the requirements of his
enterprise, and the needs and abilities of his personnel, and
judiciously match the two. If he recognizes the nature of his
situation and handles it properly, no errors will occur. The
position is not easy, but those depicted here are well qualified to
attain successful results.
Most auspicious: He will be a wise and clever man who can
turn adverse situations into favorable conditions, who can change
erroneous ideas into healthy and progressive ones, and who can
turn deviations into tao (the right path), on a large scale. He will
have many auspicious events in his life.
Least auspicious: He will also be a rich man, but may live a
comfortable and self-satisfying life, rather than one of major
public service or service to others.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will establish a favorable repu-
                                tation, and become widely known
                                and acclaimed.

                                the suit. A generally favorable year.
Line 6 He wears a wooden cangue. His ears cannot hear.
Misfortune!

Obstinate and impractical persons, who are not willing to listen to
others, are depicted. Even if they do hear something, they do not
pay attention to it. They are persons of low intelligence and
wisdom, who do not and will not recognize their difficulties. 'With
such characteristics they are virtually incorrigible. They must be
made to suffer for the manner in which they live their life with
respect to others. Hence, misfortune will be their lot during most
of their existence.

Most auspicious: If riches are inherited they will be a constant
source of worry and trouble. He will make a few gains on his own,
but will not find much happiness in life.
Least auspicious: He will be ruthless, domineering and stub-
born, and frequently involved in disputes and troubles. He
may commit felonies and end up in jail, or suffer serious
injury.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He will receive unmerited blame,
                              and is likely to be demoted.

   Ordinary people            He will encounter many disputes.
                              A poor year.

Hexagram   22   Pi   ==    Ornamentation


SIMPLE   TRANSLATION        OF TEXT
Ornamentation has success. Favorable for small matters only.
:5 I The Predictions

COMMENTARY
Just as ornamentation and adorning have their advantages in
nature, so likewise there are times in man's life when it is
propitious. In nature one finds ornamentation a matter of
attraction, or for disguise and protection. Man can always do well
by emulating nature under the right circumstances. This man
should recognize that this condition applies to small matters and
is favorable for them. Important matters require other approaches
and deeper considerations. These persons tend to be ostentatious
on the surface, in both their personal and professional lives, and
would do well in advertising, public relations, and related fields
where attraction in its various aspects is a requirement. Some of
these individuals will display external characteristics which will
hide their inner merit. Most will have a clear insight into
conditions facing them, since the trigram Li, clarity, is in the
lower position. Externally, their actions should be quiet and firm,
like Ken, mountain, the upper trigram.
    Those born in the eleventh month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line   I   Ornamentation of his feet. He leaves the carriage and
walks.

The symbolism is that of a person who knows the right way and
wants to follow it through the application of his own efforts,
rather than take advantage of any easy conditions made available
to him by others. The person depicted, knowing that he would
walk, paid special attention to being well shod. Individuals of this
type are highly independent, self-reliant and proud. Their pride
is in doing what is right, rather than the pride of egotism. They
are willing to accept life as it is dealt to them, and advance step
by step.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of talent and virtue, yet
content to be in whatever situation he finds himself. He is not
given to great emotion, and rarely desires to express either great
joy or great sorrow. He will climb steadily in life, and will
ceaselessly endeavor to improve himself.
Least auspicious: He will face many hardships and have a
routine life, but will not complain.

In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official             He may be demoted or dismissed.
  Business and professional       He may be defamed or derogated.
  Ordinary people                 A year of hardships. Actions bring
                                  hope; inaction leads to failure.
Line   2   He adorns his beard.

Often social and professional situations demand adapting oneself
to certain customs and traditions, as well as to modes of respect.
This is what is symbolized here, but, in keeping with the
hexagram as a whole, such actions are external only and do not
stem from one's inner self. Consequently, even though these
persons conform they do not do so from desire or with ulterior
motives. They remain true to themselves under all conditions.
These persons have the strength of character, which, when
coupled with ability, can produce great results.
Most auspicious: He will be professionally learned, and socially
cultivated. He will be sought by those in high places, and will
render valuable service to others.
Least auspicious: He will also be well educated and enjoy
social status. His life may become quiet when he is older. In
general, he will be fortunate.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be promoted through the
                               help of others.
   Business and professional He will gain advancement through
                               writing something creative and
                               professionally valuable.
   Ordinary people             He will profit through the help of
                               others.
Line}     His ornaments are sparkling. Righteous persistence
brings good fortune.

These persons have much natural good luck, as opposed to
auspiciousness brought about by their own personal development.
They must be careful to follow right paths and recognize that
advancements must be of their own making. Indolence would
nullify the benefits that naturally accrue as long asthey continue to
progress. Basically, they are calm, peaceful and considerate persons,
who are at ease with the world, their family and their circumstances.
3   I   The Predictions
Most auspicious: His efforts and abilities will help the growth
of the people and the nation, especially economically. He will
attain major results and become famous. He should be assigned to
influential positions.
Least auspicious: He will be helped by others, as well as attain
some achievements on his own. He will have a long and generally
easy life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be supported by influential
                                persons and assigned to a better
                                position.
   Business and professional He will have many adherents and
                                supporters. Fame is likely.
   Ordinary people              An auspicious year. He will be
                                helped by many people.
Line 4 Complete ornamentation like a white Pegasus. Not a
despoiler but desires betrothal.

A white horse with wings is symbolic of winged thoughts that
transcend time and space. Thus this person adorns himself
inwardly with modern and ancient wisdom; this gives him the
external appearance of being superior. Some people therefore are
afraid of him and imagine that he will use his knowledge and
power for wrong purposes. They see him in an adverse light but
he is not what they think. His objective is to cooperate to the
maximum extent, using his broad knowledge to be of service and
benefit to others.
Most auspicious: He will be learned in both ancient and modern
writings, and will be a creative writer himself. He may have
many hardships early in life, but as he progresses he will make
concrete gains, and possibly even amass great wealth. He may
achieve fame.
Least auspicious: He will also have hardships early in life,
which will slowly change to good fortune later. He will
have faithful friends, and his family life will be moderately
good.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        There will be many obstructions
                              early in the year, with things
                              smoothing themselves out later.

  Business and professional   He will have minor losses early in
                              the year, with major gains later.
   Ordinary people            Quarrels followed by reconcilia-
                              tions. Sorrows followed by joys.
                              Dangers followed by safety.
Line 5 Ornamented with a roll of silk of poor quality, he strolls
through the hills and gardens. Some humiliation, but ultimately
good fortune.

Here are depicted the Emperor's hills and gardens surrounding
Peking. These serve as objects of admiration by the people, and
help to satisfy inner yearnings as well as a desire to be associated
with success. Some Emperors even like to display moderation in
their dress, but people expect a greater show of superiority and
nobility. This causes some temporary humiliation, but since the
goals and motives are right good fortune ultimately prevails.
Consequently, wise leaders will recognize the value of example,
and will use external ornamentation befitting their station even
though they may personally dislike doing so.
Most auspicious: He will be pure and honest, leading his
country or his enterprise well. He may have a tendency to be
parsimonious, but not to a dangerous degree. He will gain
considerable wealth and possessions as a result of good leadership,
and can expect a long life.
Least auspicious: He will be a man of small mind and limited
vision, who will find it hard to support himself, let alone lead
others beneficially.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer Or official         He will find himself in a position
                               of leadership and will fare well.
   Business and professional Expansions and developments are
                               propitious.
   Ordinary people             If goals are proper it will be a good
                               year.
Line 6 Simple ornamentation. No blame.                                   II
Those described here are beyond the necessity for ornamentation
or adornment. They are the ones who are noticed wherever they
go, no matter what they may be wearing. They present an
external reflection of a highly developed inner self, which is
3    I   The Predictions
similar to what a Zen master or guru can see when he looks at
those students who are meditating truly and gaining in spirit-
uality. Such persons have found the true, real values in life,
and know that simplicity is among the highest attributes of the
most good. These people are a blessing wherever they are, and
whatever they are doing.
Most auspicious: He will lead a simple and natural life as a
result of his great innate, and cultivated, wisdom, along with his
ever increasing intelligence. Despite his simplicity he will render
true service to others, have good fortune and become rich.
Least auspicious: He will have a good and quiet character, and
will serve mankind, but to a lesser degree than the most aus-
picious. He will be quite able to take care of himself appropriately,
as well as others who may be dependent on him.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will advance in status and
                                salary.
   Business and professional Some ambitions will be fulfilled,
                                and he will make gains.
   Ordinary people              Simple, straightforward methods
                                will result in a good year.

KEYNOTES
1.   Be willing to do whatever needs to be done.
2.   Conform externally if necessary.
3.   Be at peace with yourself.
4.   Let your thoughts be cooperative.
5.   Purity and honesty are highly valued in self-development.
6.   Simplicity frees one from error.

CONDENSATIONS              FOR   DAILY   CYCLES
1.  Be ready and willing to engage in self-cultivation.

3. You will be aided by your friends and peers. Good fortune.
4.. Answers to our questions often come in a manner which at
first seems strange.

Hexagram     2)   Po   ==   Cleavage


SIMPLE     TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
Cleavage. No movement in any direction advantageous.

COMMENTARY
The trigram Ken, mountain, is resting on the trigram K'un,
earth. The law of change and the law of equalization are operative
here. The action of the latter is to try and reduce the mountain
and fill up the valleys, and by the former, the five Yin lines are
trying to cast out the one remaining Yang. The action is sym-
bolized by the pattern of the lines representing a bed, with,
presumably, someone on it. Efforts are being made to separate
this person from the situation. Basically, this hexagram presents
inferior persons trying to climb, using surreptitious and nefarious
methods, with a desire to replace the one at the top. Cleavage
of interests and actions naturally results. Fortunately, the inner
hexagram is K'un, the Receptive, hence there is considerable
hope for those wise enough to discern the valuelessness of climb-
ing methods, and to let themselves be led into correct ways and
cooperative efforts. As for strong persons, they will become even
stronger from their trials and experiences. 'Cleavage' is primarily
symbolic of the separation of good from evil, of the Yang from
the Yin, and hence actions taken are not advantageous. The
Yang and the Yin ought to cooperate, and are most propitious
when they are in balance, not opposition. When they are in
opposition nothing productive is accomplished. Persons with this
natal hexagram would do well to cultivate and increase their
virtue to recapture this balance.
   Those born in the ninth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line   I  Cleavage of the leg of the bed. Lack of steadfast
rectitude. Misfortune.

These individuals may be either good persons whom mean persons
are trying to cast out, or the mean persons themselves. It is
quite possible that they will neither be wholly good nor wholly
mean, since everyone has some good and some bad in him. Their

                                                                197

traits can range from those of a sour misanthrope to those of a
virtuous scholar. They are not gifted in any particular field, and
can be found in most careers. What distinguishes them from
others is their motivation.
Most auspicious: Will be, or will become, a virtuous and
upright person, but not in a very high degree. He will face
many problems, but will be able to overcome them with recti-
tude.
Least auspicious: He will be an insincere and supercilious
climber, or a self-righteous avenger. He will be a wanderer, and,
on the whole, will have an unstable and difficult life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will face serious difficulty, and
                               must grasp the right moment for

                               brother, and other troubles.
Line 2 Cleavage of the edge of the bed. Lack of steadfast
rectitude. Misfortune.

The cleavage of the good from the bad is even more pronounced
here than in line 1. The good person finds it hard to avert the
evil that is closing in about him. The evil persons are similar to
those in line 1, but wiser and stronger in their ways. The good
must take action to escape from evil, as often and as quickly as
possible. However, it must be done with flexibility, or else errors
will occur which could lead to misfortune.
Most auspicious: He will become a rich, upright and virtuous
person, but subject to many slanders, lawsuits, intrigues, and
attempts by others to obtain money.
Least auspicious: He is likely to be obsequious, and to have
ulterior motives. Those somewhat more elevated in character
will work hard, but will find it difficult to support their family
and have good family relationships. No help from friends or
relatives should be expected

                             problem, and perhaps demoted as

   Business and professional All matters will be harder than
                             normal to accomplish this year.
   Ordinary people           He will have troubles and argu-
                             ments, with many suspicious and
                             harsh words exchanged.
Line 3 He cleaves (it). No error.

The five Yin lines, pushing upward, are uniting and working
together to cast out goodness, i.e. the Yang line at the top.
Line 3 is central among the five Yin lines, and so is the one most
concerned and involved in the effort. It is the only one, however,
with a correct correspondence, and since this is with line 6 no
error is made. This correspondence causes the more auspicious
to try to dissociate themselves from evil and support the good.
Since line 3 is a Yin in the wrong place, some of these persons
will succumb and join in the majority effort, whatever its nature.
The more auspicious work well in solitude, are studious, diligent
and full of fortitude. The less auspicious have a herd instinct
and need companionship for their efforts, especially if they
are nefarious. When by themselves they are practically use-
less.
Most auspicious: He will be better than average in virtue and
in his efforts to lead a good and purposeful life. He will be
generally very persistent.
Least auspicious: He will have but little virtue, and scant good
fortune. He will tend to be an iconoclast.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official       He will meet a superior who
                              recognizes his ability.
    Business and professional He will face opposition at every
                              turn. He may have a few successes,
                               but they will only be small.
    Ordinary people            He will have no profits, and much
                               difficulty with his family.
 Line 4 Cleavage of the mattress of the bed. Misfortune.

In ancient times, the 'mattress of the bed' was no more than a
3   I   The Predictions
piece of cloth or skin stretched across the frame. When this is
torn, the bed becomes useless and the occupant faces danger.
This imminent danger keeps such persons from being as effective
as they normally would be. This symbolism is carried over into
their lives. They are prone to experience sudden handicaps,
dangers and misfortunes instigated by others. Furthermore,
there is no one close to them nor near them to help them in their
efforts to progress and advance. Hence, these persons need to have
exceptionally strong characters to survive such conditions and
not be pulled under or overcome by the dangers and evils
surrounding them. Lines 1, 2 and 3 also have adversities associated
with them. Here the evil is even stronger than in the previous
three lines. Fortunately line 4 is virtually independent of, rather
than cooperating with, lines 1, 2 and 3. Therefore the evils,
even though great, can be overcome by the individual himself.
How well one does depends solely on the individual.
Most auspicious: The truly strong will put trepidation into the
hearts and minds of evil persons approaching them. They will
automatically draw away from evil by virtue of their innate
goodness. Their lives will be difficult but successful.
Least auspicious: The evil is great, and hence these egregious
persons will have a tendency to destroy themselves by their
actions. They may make temporary gains occasionally. They will
have no surviving heirs.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be in, or close to danger,
                               all year.
   Business and professional Nothing favorable is indicated.
                               Defamations are likely.
   Ordinary people             There will be many troubles and
                               disputes. Lawsuits are likely.
Line 5 School of fishes. Favored like court ladies. Everything
favorable.

This line is the leader of the five Yin lines and leads them like
a school of fishes. Being close to line 6, it is influenced by it,
changing its nature to goodness. Leading a group to cherish
goodness and virtue merits great reward, hence everything is
favorable. Religious, political and military leaders, primarily, are
depicted here, those who have a natural attraction for others, the

gift of the gab, and a professional expertise that commands
respect and a following.
Most auspicious: He will be a great and noble person, who
fosters the welfare of the nation and the betterment of mankind.
He will greatly aid the evolutionary process, and will be adept in
both civil and military matters, even if in a religious order. He
will leave a favorable impression wherever he goes.
Least auspicious: He will be above average in his personal and
professional ability and management. He may however need, and
receive, some help from his superiors (mentally and spiritually).
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be promoted, and will
                                assume increased responsibility.
   Business and professional He will be well rewarded for some
                                of his personal efforts.

                                tween himself and his family.
Line 6 The large fruit remains uneaten. The superior man
acquires a carriage, whereas the inferior loses his house.

Those who survive the difficulties to this stage find a truly great
cleavage between the good and the evil. The good, the Yang line,
has remained in the hexagram and become exalted. There is
much nourishment available to others, as symbolized by the
large, uneaten fruit. Regrettably, the inferior does not want it,
consequently he suffers by separation from the good. The goodness
here is compounded of innate wisdom, strength, virtue, fortitude,
and leadership. The person having these qualities acquires
whatever he seeks, and has the support of the people as well.
'The inferior loses his house' indicates that those who are not
good will be unstable, have no firm roots to rely on, and will
probably lose their most precious possessions.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of great virtue, assigned to a
highly influential position, capable of dispelling calamities and of
pacifying the nation. He will be impeccant.
Least auspicious: He will be of low intelligence, vicious,
vituperative, virtueless and mean. He will probably lose his
friends, family, and possessions, and be a constant source of
trouble to others.

COMMENTARY
This hexagram illustrates concisely the law of change and its
operation in this world. All physical changes take place in six
stages or actions. Going further then leads to a return of former
conditions, and the completion of the cycle. (Another view is that
what is sent out will return in kind.) Hexagram 1, Ch'ien, is
entirely Yang. Changes enter from the bottom. In six stages the
hexagram becomes entirely Yin, or K'un, the Receptive. With
the seventh stage the Yang starts to return, and the hexagram
then formed is this one, Fu. The cycle can repeat itself endlessly.
The 'seven days' mentioned in the text are the seven stages of
change, and with this last change being the entering of a Yang
at the bottom, with all the lines above being Yin, it is a time to
advance and make much progress. Hence it is advantageous to
have a firm goal. By profession, the kind of people symbolized
here are inventors, innovators, founders of businesses, organizers,
promoters and entrepreneurs; they are men of clarity, vision,
sound judgment, and fortitude. In their private lives, these
individuals will use the foregoing qualities to change themselves
within.
   Those born in the eleventh month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING      LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line   IReturning   a short      distance.   Need   for contrition.
Supreme good fortune.

This line is the ruler of this hexagram, and hence those depicted
here are exceptionally strong and courageous, mentally, physically
and spiritually. The trigram Chen, thunder and movement, is
under (within) trigram K'un, the earth. This tremendous inner
force is bound to create something great externally. As the ruler,
this man leads and guides sincerely, with self-discipline, docility,
humility and loving kindness. This endears him to others, and
they support his efforts and progress.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of great talent and noble
character, and one who enjoys accomplishments. He will cherish
goodness and personal development. He will be an expert
organizer, and capable of founding a new government, a new
business, or a new society. He will become rich and famous.
5   I   The Predictions
Least auspicious: He will be a person primarily cultivating
himself in tao (the right way), and not seeking fame or fortune.
However, he will render beneficial support to others when it is
vital.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He will find himself in a high
                              position, close to the ruler or
                              leader, and a staunch adviser.
   Business and professional Creative efforts will be highly
                              successful.
   Ordinary people            A good year with substantial profit.
LiM:1 Praiseworthy return. Good fortune.

The law of karma is symbolized here in that persons treating
others with consideration, tolerance, guidance, and loving
kindness reap good fortune in return. This, naturally, is praise-
worthy. This meaning is also revealed if one considers the lower
trigram. A change in line 2 from Yin to Yang produces the
trigram Tui, joy. These persons are individuals who exercise a
very high quality of leadership, whether in public or private life.
They know that they personally are accountable for their every
thought and action, and consistently strive to make these the best
possible.
Most auspicious: He will be a just and richly endowed man,
who follows the golden mean. He will not be boastful or ego-
tistical, but will be sincere and loyal to all his personnel, and to
his professional obligations. He will be highly trusted and reliable,
and will obtain riches and some fame.
Least auspicious: He will also be a man of good character, but
one content to live a private life, no matter what kind of life it
may be. He will serve others quietly and unobtrusively.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will regain his reputation and
                                grow in favor with his superiors.

                                expand or be rejuvenated.
   Ordinary people              Substantial profits can be expected.

Line 5 is a weak, Yin line in a strong place. It is not strong
enough to take the action that is necessary. vVere it so, it could
change to its opposite, which would produce the trigram Li,
clarity. Many abortive attempts towards goodness, half-heartedly
carried through, result in repeated returns. Such unstable and
vacillating action makes one's position precarious. Since these
individuals are striving to do what is right, no damage will be
done to their inner selves. These persons are individualists who
have some idea of what is right and what produces the best
results, and who make many experiments. They are to be
commended for their efforts, even though their accomplishments
in their chosen field are not great.
Most auspicious: He will strive to cultivate his virtue and
character, as well as improve himself professionally. He will
readily reform whenever he notes an error. He will frequently
advance and frequently retreat; at times he will be lucky, and at
others unlucky. He will not attain greatness.
Least auspicious: He will have many hardships in life, along
with, regrettably, considerable sorrow.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be in an unstable position.
   Business and professional He will achieve fame for literary
                               efforts.
   Ordinary people             A slow year, with frequent doubts
                               and indecisions.
Line 4 Walking in the company of others. Returning alone.

The symbolism here comes from this line being the middle line
ofthe five Yin lines, and hence walking among them. Fortunately,
line 4 is a correlate of line 1, and this aids it favorably, but it is the
only line which has a proper correlation. Line 1 is very strong
and this influences line 4 to return to what is right without any
promises of favoritism or reward. These persons do not let
themselves be swept along blindly with the crowd, or over
influenced by their associates. They evaluate matters for them-
selves, and then try to do what they think is right. Basically, they
lack sufficient strength to accomplish great results, and would do
well to constantly cultivate themselves mentally and spiritually,
and try especially to keep themselves up to date. Such actions will
promote auspiciousness.
                                                                     20 5
:5   I The Predictions
Most auspicious: With diligence and persistence he will become
a man of virtue and wealth. He will be calm in times of anarchy,
rebellion or danger. He will not be stirred by demagogues,
whatever their allegiance. He will follow tao (the right path).
Least auspicious: He may work in a large organization, and
strive for independence of thought and action. He is likely to be
in a position demanding considerable travel. He may find restful
conditions later in life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He will regain an influential and
                              important position.
   Business and professional He will achieve a favorable reputa-
                              tion.
   Ordinary people            He will make a good profit.
Line 5 Magnanimous return. No regret.

The fifth line is normally the ruling line in a hexagram, so these
persons have a tendency to dominate a situation with their own
thoughts and efforts. Inwardly they know that this is not for the
best, so they nobly and unselfishly return to fundamentals to
discover guide lines for their actions, development and achieve-
ments, irrespective of the nature of their goal, whether mental,
physical or spiritual. Their motive is to build on firm foundations,
only using suitable methods and materials, in great and small
matters alike, both personally and professionally. Doing thus
leads to success, not regrets.
Most auspicious: He is likely to be in a high and influential
position and well qualified to meet his situation, both personally
and professionally. He will be noble in character, rich in friends,
and respected by adversaries. He will attain wealth, property
and possessions.
Least auspicious: He will strive to become a more auspicious
person, and will make some worthy achievement on a modest
scale.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will move to a better position.
   Business and professional His services will be sought by others.
   Ordinary people             He will be able to put aside some
                               savings. His father may become
                               seriously ill or die.

Line 6 Confused. Uncertain return. Misfortune. Calamities
and disasters. If armies are set in motion by the ruler, defeat.
For ten years it will not be possible to attack again.

One's external world reflects that which is within oneself. This
man is confused within, and muddled in his thinking. He has
considerable innate wisdom, but his position (line 6) places him
in circumstances with which he is inadequately qualified to cope.
This results in disasters. The situation becomes so dire that 'ten
years' are required to put things right. 'Ten years' as used here
 means a cycle of experience. Therefore a whole new cycle must
be undergone to attain success. If this 'return' is missed he will
suffer many misfortunes. He must place his faith and trust in the
 Creator and divine law. These persons will have extremely active
lives, with many successes and failures, both great and small,
 until they learn the lesson of converting themselves inwardly
into men of tao and the golden mean.
Most auspicious: He will know how to effect reforms nationally,
 locally and within himself. He readily learns the lessons of life,
 and after some trial and error, will gain and retain wealth, along
 with a favorable reputation. His personal life will also be favored.
 Least auspicious: He will be a stupid, dull person, learning
slowly. He may be crippled or ill for long periods of time. He will
 cause troubles for himself, his family and his country.
 In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official         He will be held in contempt for
                                sticking to his position and accom-
                                plishing nothing worthwhile.
    Business and professional He will suffer indignity if his
                                actions are not outstanding.
    Ordinary people             If confused, hold firm and wait for
                                difficulties to clear up.

KEYNOTES
1.   A quick return from minor transgressions is favorable.
2.   Self-mastery is highly beneficial.

COMMENTARY
Primal movement, Chen, the lower trigram, is surrounded by
heaven, the upper trigram, symbolizing circumspection and
innocence. These persons have great inner strength and capacity,
which, if properly trained and developed, can be of true benefit
to mankind. They will be blessed with common sense, innate
intelligence and communicativeness. This last quality is apparent
when one considers the hexagram from an external point of view,
i.e. thunder below heaven, making itself known and heard
everywhere. In this respect these persons are capable of giving
abundant and timely nourishment to those willing to receive it.
This nourishment is in the form of knowledge of the laws of
heaven, the reflection of innocence, and the taking of actions free
from guile. Heaven, however, does not follow the laws of man
and often injects what it deems most fitting. Hence there is an
element of the unexpected here too.
   Those born from the second to the eighth month, the months of
thunder, will be more auspicious, with those born in the second
month being the most auspicious of all.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line   I   Circumspect advancement brings good fortune.

By the sequence of changes entering at the bottom and moving
upwards, this hexagram becomes the next step in the evolution of
Hexagram 1z, Standstill. When things first begin to move again,
under the primal guidance of heaven, they are bound to be
circumspect, with much good resulting therefrom. These persons
will have dynamic personalities and forceful minds. They will
make forthright progress with intrepidity. Their degree of success
will be measured largely by the wisdom of their actions. In
general, what they will is done.
Most auspicious: He will keep his mind active by a progressive
attitude, and will keep abreast of changes in his profession, his
community, and his country. He will have great ambitions
relating to national goals and purposes; he will become an
important personage, and lead a highly favored life.
Least auspicious: He will also have a good and beneficial life,
filled with modest success and good fortune.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official        He will be supported and trusted
                               by his ruler or superior, and by the
                               people.
    Business and professional He will gain fame and a reputation
                               through creative efforts.

Line 2 Do not count the harvest while ploughing, or anticipate
the results of your efforts. It is propitious (however) to have a
firm goal.

A universal law is stated here. Man never has full control over
any situation. Heaven exercises control, and this is symbolized
here by the trigram Ch'ien, heaven, being above, i.e. the upper
trigram, which controls the lower trigram. It is probable that
from this comes the saying 'Heaven helps the man who helps
himself.' If one has firm goals and devotes oneself constantly and
persistently towards them one is bound to obtain results at a time
that is in keeping with universal time (i.e. the time decreed by
heaven). 'What is accomplished is sufficiently abundant that the
                                                                  z09

individual need have no concern over when results will OCcur.
Can a farmer count his harvest when he ploughs? Can a business
definitely know its prospective sales? Many things can happen
between the ploughing and the harvest. Diversification, of course,
increases the chance of success, but each activity must have a
firm goal. This man, likewise, should do many different things,
and do all that is necessary in pursuit of his goals. Success and
good fortune then will be his. Broadminded and perspicacious
individuals of noble character will know what to do at all times,
and will do it propitiously.
Most auspicious: He will be a foreseeing and lucky individual,
following the golden mean. He will not be concerned about fame
or profit, but will achieve them anyway. He will have an easy and
adventitious life.
Least auspicious: He may be lazy and indulgent, gratifying
selfish desires, or a wanderer with no fixed destination or
strength of character. He will find it hard to support himself and
his family.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will gain promotion in status,
                                position or salary.
   Business and professional He will achieve his dominant aims.

                                in an enterprise. A good year.
 Line}     Unexpected adversity. The tethered ox was taken by a
passer-by. The owner's loss.

Having gains made by others at our expense is unexpected
adversity and a true loss. This indicates that the law of karma
is operative, reminding us that sometimes unexpected things
happen to us which are not our (apparent) fault. On the other
hand one should not put temptation in another's path, as symbol-
ized by the unguarded ox. Nor should one consider goodness by
itself to be sufficient. One must guard and protect one's endow-
ments, both material and spiritual. It behooves these persons to
strive for a balanced life, and many will be successful.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of driving energy and
strength, who knows how to make and keep gains, whose virtue is
adequate to dispel calamities, whose fortitude overcomes adversity,

munity relations.

                              will offset each other.
Line 4 Persevering in rectitude. No error.

Here in line 4, the position of the minister, one is enjoined to
devote thought, time and effort to carrying out the meaning of the
hexagram as a whole. If this is done with rectitude there will be
no error. The implication is that if these persons are not cir-
cumspect, troubles will develop. To remain circumspect at all
times is difficult. (This is also suggested by this being a strong
line in a weak place.) Consequently, greatness is not predicted.
These persons will be in above average positions, and will carry
out their duties and responsibilities diligently and with honor.
Most auspicious: He will be a gentleman of considerable honor,
talent and morality, who readily helps others while privately
cultivating his own virtue. He will have a favorable life, with
many worthwhile accomplishments.
Least auspicious: He will receive ample remuneration for his
services to be able to live a life without financial difficulties.

Line 5 Unanticipated illness. Use not untried medicine, and it
will be joyful.

This line is the ruler of the hexagram and depicts the leader and
minister working together, laying plans in case of unanticipated
changes or difficulties. Their actions are right and proper (a
strong line in a strong place) and thus they keep things under
control. These persons should study nature, and follow the laws of
heaven and earth rather than try to be innovators. Their far-
sighted plans and actions will achieve favorable results. In-
dividuals with this controlling line will be leaders and high
officials in their chosen field, who have the potential to avert
possible disasters for the group with which they are associated.
They will do their best if they follow proven methods.
Most auspicious: As a leader, he will be a man of virtue, vigor,
vitality and vision, who is audacious yet follows the golden mean.
He will know how to keep or restore peace in all his associations.
He will have an excellent family, coupled with wealth and much
joy.

difficulties, and the recipient of a long life and much happiness.

                                itself. Business should be successful.
Line 6 Uncircumspect actions bring misfortune.

Here at the top of the hexagram, one has passed the time for
propitious action. Therefore, to push forward would be contrary
to this stage of progress, and would be reprehensible. Action could
lead to much opposition and exhaustion. Those depicted here
should be calm, thoughtful, far-sighted, up to date, and modest
individuals if they are to achieve success. Patience is a great
virtue. They should not try to oppose fate, but should keep their
motives pure and innocent.

5   I   The Predictions

Hexagram       26   Ta Ch'u ~        The Great Restraining


SIMPLE       TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
The Restraining Power of the Great. Good fortune from not
eating at home. Advantageous to cross the great water.

COMMENTARY
Several important aspects of this situation are symbolized.
Heaven, below, is rising up into the mountain. This implies a
daily renewal of strength. It is also a time for accumulation, but
along with this amassing, superior persons should be nourishing
others as well as paying reverence to the ancients and their
knowledge. The mountain further signifies that these persons
pursue their courses with judgment and proper restraint,
retreating or holding firm when necessary. 'Good fortune from
not eating at home' indicates that this is a time for initiating
further external actions. These may be material, physical or
spiritual, and they will be in accord with the will of heaven as
long as they curb and correct evil. These persons will be per-
spicacious, judicious, consistent, reliable, courageous and wise.
   Those born in the twelfth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING          LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line I Danger is at hand. 'Vise to desist from efforts towards
progress.

Persons with this controlling line are very observant and
analytical. They are constantly aware of a great many things
that need to be done. Regrettably, their natal position is such
that they are held back by circumstances and powers beyond
their control. Even though there are many things they would
like to do, they will find that they can get the most satisfaction
out of life by improving themselves, rather than by endeavoring
to improve external circumstances in their profession.
Most auspicious: He will be a wise person, who knows how to
survive within the limits by which he is circumscribed. He will
take good care of himself mentally, physically and spiritually,
while limiting his external aspirations. He will lead a personally
satisfactory life.

Least auspicious: He will be weak-willed, and will occasionally
succumb to the dangers surrounding him. He will have a generally
troublesome life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official       He should retreat, or withdraw
                             from conflicting matters.
   Business and professional He should be passive and wait for
                             conditions to change.
   Ordinary people           He should not try anything new,
                             or troubles will ensue.
Line z The carriage axle is broken.

Self-restraint is being exercised here. The fifth line is the normal
correlate of the second. Since both here are in wrong positions,
the result is judicious restraint rather than fortuitous advance-
ment. The Chinese text implies that the axle is the person to
whom this line relates. These individuals are of the type who
work quietly behind the scenes, developing master plans which
others execute. They themselves are always in the background.
Most auspicious: He will be a talented, judicious, upright,
quick-witted and intelligent individual, possessing much know-
ledge. He will master-mind matters of lasting benefit. He may
assume important positions for short periods of time, but will
be readily willing to give them up. He will lead a personally
satisfying life.
Least auspicious: He will have an unfortunate childhood. His
professional efforts later will not be of great or lasting benefit.
He will have frequent ailments or injuries, some, perhaps, to the
feet, and will have a short life.
In yearly hexagram:

3   I   The Predictions
The exercise of too much freedom can be dangerous, therefore
they are enjoined to exert righteous persistence. Doing so will be
advantageous. With two Yin lines ahead of line 3, the way is
open for these persons to advance. By keeping their professional
standards high, and at the peak of proficiency, they will achieve
many benefits. Their rise can be rapid if they choose the right
goals, and pursue them single-mindedly.
Most auspicious: He will be learned, clever, and judicious, and
endowed with innate common sense and practicality. He may be
assigned to a high industrial, business or governmental position
(more than likely involving a considerable amount of travelling).
Least auspicious: He will have aspirations similar to those of
the most auspicious, but acts without due consideration and
mature deliberation. He is impractical and does not take care of
himself, professionally or personally, and will therefore ex-
perience unavoidable losses. He will have many hardships.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         Promotion can be expected.
   Business and professional His scope for action and his
                               responsibilities will be enlarged in
                               a favorable manner.
   Ordinary people             He will get help from his superiors
                               and friends. If he works hard he
                               will make some gains.
 Line 4 Headboard on the young bull. Great good fortune.

A headboard on a young bull restrains the horns from doing
damage. Line 4 has the trigram Ch'ien immediately below it,
with the latter's creative strength driving upward. This has the
effect of making these individuals exercise special care and
attention on restraining and guiding the strength and aspirations
of those below them, and on curbing evil or erroneous propensities
at the start. Such persons are great natural teachers, in all walks
of life. Their unselfish and devoted efforts are very effective, and
great good fortune arises from them.
Most auspicious: He will be well qualified both personally and
professionally, and possess a deep, innate knowledge of psychology
which he will use instinctively as occasion demands. He will
achieve considerable wealth, and a high status.
Least auspicious: He will either be in a small, independent

position, or an assistant to some auspicious person. His knowledge,
mentality and experience are insufficient to handle great
responsibilities.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be promoted, and be very
                                pleased about it.
   Business and professional His reputation will be enhanced,
                                and his responsibilities broadened.
   Ordinary people              A generally favorable year, with
                                something especially joyful occur-
                               ring.
Line 5   A gelded boar's tusks. Good fortune.

As one of the rulers of this hexagram, in a ruling position, this
line symbolizes leaders among men, who need to repress and
restrain evil. 'A gelded boar's tusks' represents that which needs
to be restrained and shows the method by which it can be done.
A wild boar is very dangerous and uses its tusks to harm others,
Once a boar is gelded, it no longer cares to use its tusks. Therefore
'gelding' evil is a good way to restrain and eradicate it, rather than
trying to combat it directly. Good, wise, steadfast, and strong men,
with courage and vitality, are required to carry out such matters.
Most auspicious: He will be highly talented, both personally
and professionally, with innate qualities of leadership. He will be
assigned to positions involving the establishing of policies, and
controlling or influencing large numbers of people. He will make
positive contributions within his sphere of influence, and will
have a good and rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will not be a man of great vision, and so
his life will be on a small scale, self-circumscribed to within
narrow limits. He will have a better than average, modest life,
with some joyful events.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He will be promoted, in salary,
                                 status or position.

Line 6 Applying heaven's way. Success.
5    I   The Predictions
These are sage individuals, who have studied the manifestations
of heaven and the laws of earth, and know how to apply them
in a manner similar to that in which heaven does. These persons
are perspicacious, helpful, judicious, profound, erudite, sagacious,
far-sighted and dynamically courageous. Regrettably, a few
have an inner negativity which prevents them from being highly
successful. If you are not achieving your desired results, correct
yourself inwardly.
Most auspicious: He will be one of the great and noble persons
of his time, highly respected and greatly sought after. He will
achieve results that will benefit mankind as a whole, or, at least,
a great many people. He will become renowned for his efforts
towards peace and the improvement of mankind. He will have a
very rewarding life, rich in friends, health, joy and material
pleasures.
Least auspicious: He will be very ambitious, but will be set
back by an inner negativity that will keep him from being
successful, both personally and professionally.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be promoted, through the
                                acclaim and desires of others.
   Business and professional He will achieve a highly favorable
                                reputation, and will be supported
                                by others.
   Ordinary people              A good year, with influential and

keeping one's goal firmly in mind at all times.

tribution of nourishment, will bring good fortune.

Hexagram 27      I   ==   Jaws (Nourishment)


SIMPLE    TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
Jaws. Righteous persistence brings good fortune. Observe the
nourishing of others, and what they provide for themselves.

COMMENTARY
 The principal trait of individuals with this natal hexagram is that
 they are diagnosticians. This hexagram is made up of the trigram
 Ken, mountain, over Chen, thunder, or movement. The hexa-
 gram looks rather like an open mouth, with two strong lines at
 each end and all Yin lines in the middle. The upper Yang line
.is stable, like the upper bone of the mouth. The lower Yang line
 is unstable, like the moveable jaw-bone. The four Yin lines
 represent the cavity of the mouth. Consequently the hexagram
 is named' Jaws,' and in such a manner in the Chinese text that it
 relates to nourishment. The three lower lines have reference to
 material nourishment and the three upper lines to the spiritual.
 Being persistent in righteousness naturally leads to good fortune.
 Being observant of what people seek, and how they desire to be
 nourished, helps the superior person to help others. The superior
 man is deliberate in his speech, and modest in his own eating and
 drinking. Confucius enjoins students to note what parts of their
bodies other people are concerned about, and how those persons
 nourish themselves; they can then know what types of individual
these persons are. This advice is still valid, with the up to date
 adjunct that behind every man's desire are needs he is trying to
 fill. Broadly speaking, the persons depicted here will be leaders,
with greater or lesser responsibilities for nourishing others. They
can be found in nearly every walk of life, dependi.ng on their
                                                                   219

    personal desires and choice. They will diagnose the needs of
    people, and try to find ways and means to satisfy them.
      Those born in the eighth month will be more auspicious.

    Line    You release your magic tortoise and stare at me with
            I
    jaws open. Misfortune.

    Basically, these persons are not exercIsmg proper control over
    their own destiny. The magic tortoise is the animal the shell of
    which was used for divination in early times. To lose one's magic
    tortoise means that one lets one's life become subject to chance
    rather than positive control. 'With jaws open' is symbolic of
    wanting to be fed like a baby. Either such persons do not want to
    bite (work hard) for their nourishment, or else they are so
    lackadaisical that they do not care. These persons would gladly be
    parasites if circumstances permitted. In any event, they are
    unable to persist in following true goals, but tend to follow
    mirages on the horizon.
    Most auspicious: He will seek his fortune in a foreign country
    where he imagines life will be easier. He will be poor in worldly
    wealth, and mean in disposition. He will be greedy but lazy.
    Although he may make some slight gains, he will mainly have
    large losses.
    Least auspicious: He will be anomalous, disloyal and corrupt.
    He will have a difficult life, which will end in disaster.
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official          He will be blamed for some serious

       Business and professional He will be blamed for corruption
                                    and immorality.
       Ordinary people              He will have troubles and disputes
                                    over money. A quiet year with

     Line 2 Nourishment at the mountain top. Digressing from the
     normal way of nourishment from the hills. Misfortune.

    The best nourishment in this hexagram comes from the top of
    the mountain, line 6. Normally, the second line should correlate
    with, and seek nourishment from, the fifth line, i.e. in this case,
    220
                                               :5   I   The Predictions
half-way up the mountain, equivalent to 'the hills.' Seeking
nourishment in the wrong place or in the wrong way naturally
leads to misfortune. This line depicts persons who separate from
their own kind, and seek nourishment for which they are not
duly prepared.
Most auspicious: He will lead a quiet and unhurried life,
keeping out of troubles, and sustaining himself and his family
modestly. He will have a safe and relatively uneventful life, and
will seek to improve himself inwardly.
Least auspicious: He will have unstable characteristics and a
vacillating personality, with others never knowing what to
expect from him. He will not concentrate or persevere, and
he will have a propensity for cheating or getting things the
easy way. He will have many hardships, and some serious
troubles.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        Demotion of some sort is likely.
   Business and professional Defamations and derogations are
                              probable.
   Ordinary people            It will be difficult to either advance
                              or retreat. He will have disputes
                              over money matters, and he may
                              become seriously ill, or die.
Line J Deliberate forgoing of nourishment. Misfortune. Ten
years are wasted. Advancement not advantageous.

Line 3, as the lower center of the mouth, looks to the jaw-bone,
line 1, for its nourishment rather than to line 6, its normal
correlate. The lesson here, as elsewhere, in I Ching is that man
must develop his inner self, from which an auspicious external
life will follow. A change of this line to its opposite produces
hexagram zz, Pi, which is concerned with external embellish-
ments. A whole cycle of life (ten years) is wasted in pursuing
such a course. Any advancement in this direction will only make
matters worse. Heed the warning.
Most auspicious: He will be reasonably talented, and sufficiently
wise to be able to restrain and repress damaging desires, as well
as to reform if he makes mistakes. His life will be on a humble
scale, but good.
Least auspicious: He will be a violent, base and dishonest
                                                                    ZZI

    Line 4 Nourishment at the mountain top. Good fortune.
    Staring around like a starving tiger. No error.

    The heavenly and true nourishment is at the mountain top,
    line 6. Those depicted here know something about it, but as they
    are at the foot of the mountain, line 4, they are looking every-
    where with keen eyes, trying to discern how they can become
    genuinely nourished themselves, as well as how to provide
    nourishment for others. Since the fourth line is the position of a
    minister, these persons are looking for the right people to help
    and support them in this effort, in addition to seeking the proper
    nourishment for themselves. These individuals will be executives,
    or others involved with the assignment and supervision of
    personnel, or matters relating to their welfare.
    Most auspicious: He will be a man of many capabilities,
    knowledgeable, broadminded, visionary and magnanimous, who
    will accomplish worthwhile results for the people, and perhaps
    even help bring peace to the nation.

    Normally, the fifth line is the controlling line, the ruler or leader
    who nourishes, guides and supports others. Here, however, this
    function belongs to line 6. Therefore line 5 has to forsake estab-
    lished ways and gains its strength and support from line n. If
    he abides in and follows what is right, good fortune ensues.
    lJ nfortunately, the persons depicted here have inadequate
    strength, knowledge or experience to engage in great enterprises
    on their own. They will fare best when they let someone superior
    to themselves do the leading.
    Most auspicious: He is likely to inherit independent means, or
    receive considerable help from others, such that he has a good
    life. He will render some service to others, but his accomplish-
    ments will not be great.
    Least auspicious: He will probably have little or no inheritance;
    otherwise he will have a similar life to the most auspicious.

    responsibilities brings good fortune. It is favorable to cross the

    Line 6 in this hexagram (see also the commentaries on the other
    lines) is the source of nourishment. The persons depicted here
    have great wisdom, and recognize their grave responsibility for
    the nourishment being correct and proper, so that no harm is
    done to those being nourished. When one is so sagaciously
    endowed, it is also incumbent on one to pass one's knowledge,
    virtues and experience on to others, hence the admonition
    to Cross the great water. These persons are truly great and

                                               3   I   The Predictions

Hexagram:18       Ta Kuo   ==      Inner Preponderance

SIMPLE     TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
Inner Preponderance. The ridgepole sags precariously. Pursuing
a goal is advantageous. Success.

COMMENTARY
This hexagram is heavy in the middle with Yang lines, with a
weak Yin line at each end. The inner hexagram is entirely
Yang. The visual appearance of this hexagram reminded ancient
sages of the ridgepole used to support the roofs of their early
houses. The pole rose diagonally from the ground. Being heavy
in the middle, here, it sags precariously. This hexagram consists of
the trigrams Tui, lake, over Sun, wood, with the meaning of
penetration. Externally, these persons have the wherewithal to
nourish others. Inwardly, they are firm and stable, like wood.
Hence, it is desirable for these persons to have a goal where the
potential of nourishment can be used. If this is done they have
success. They are always in danger of being too one-sided in their
thoughts and deeds. This could be dangerous if they use their
great, innate inner strength selfishly. They must be impartial,
to the maximum extent possible. On the other hand their great
inner strength permits them to be undaunted, even if they have
to stand alone. So it can be a blessing or a drawback, depending
on how it is used.
   Those born in the second month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES    (FROM     BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line   I   Place white reed mats underneath. No error.

Strong and courageous individuals are depicted, who use deep
sincerity and exceptional care in all they do. They are very
meticulous. They should be differentiated from those persons
who are small-minded and who devote their time to details out
of fear. Those with this controlling line are very considerate to
everybody and everything, and give forth loving care as if all these
were their own cherished possessions. These individuals can be
found in nearly all walks of life.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of impeccable character and
                                                                  225

behaviour, highly respected and widely known. He will treat
everyone as a worthwhile person, and be exceptionally careful
and considerate to his subordinates. He will have a favorable life,
with many joys, good fortune and wealth.
Least auspicious: He will he content with his lot, neither
envious nor greedy. He may choose to live in seclusion; and he
will make no major errors.
In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official          His pOSItIOn will be firm and
                               unassailable.
   Business and professional He should exercise great care and
                               economy in his endeavors; he will
                               advance slowly.
  Ordinary people              He should be cautious and frugal
                               and he will have adequate money
                               for his basic needs. One of the
                               parents of the less auspicious Ill1IY
                               die.
Line z New shoots grow from the withered willow. An older
man has a young wife. Blessings accrue.

With the strong preponderance of Yang lines in the middle, line
z cannot join its normal correlate, line 5, and hence chooses line I.
Line 5, for the same reason, chooses line 6 for its partner, hence
here it is an older man choosing a young wife, while in the upper
case it is an older woman taking a younger man for a husband.
Exceptional strength and vigor are thus coupled here with the
wisdom of age. Despite the unusualness of this it is a productive
union. Many blessings accrue from the fortuitous combination of
the characteristics of a wise old man and the dynamic vitality of a
young girl.
Most auspicious: He will be a person who knows what he wants,
and who goes after it correctly and diligently. He will fight for
what is right and for his possessions, even if he must do so in-
dependently. He has a commendable and respectable character,
and will gradually abandon waywardness for tao. He will have a
fortuitous life, with meritable achievements.
Least auspicious: He will have many hardships early in life, but
will be moderately prosperous, and somewhat influential locally,
in his senior years.

  Ordinary people           The size of his family will increase;
                            otherwise it will be a routine year.
Line J The ridgepole sags dangerously. Misfortune.

Too much of anything is dangerous. One should follow the golden
mean, i.e. not go to extremes. Those depicted here are not judi-
cious, and do not know when to stop nor when to seek the support
of others. Their actions in general are rash, wilful, self-centered
and, above all, excessive. They are reluctant to delegate authority
and responsibility to others. As a result of their traits their friends
and their accomplishments are few.
Most auspicious: He will be a brave, ambitious and impetuous
person, anxious to help people, and his country, but too tough and
fierce to be truly effective. His results, in most cases, will be
negative rather than positive.
Least auspicious: He has little or no judgment or common
sense. He is very violent and fierce, and disasters follow in his
wake.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He may be dismissed, demoted, or
                               seriously reprimanded.
   Business and professional His position will be precarious, and
                               his efforts not readily accepted.
   Ordinary people             A generally troublesome year. He
                               may have difficulty with his feet or
                               eyes.
Line 4 The ridgepole is arched. Good fortune. If independence
is not exercised, humiliation.

The arching of metal or glass structures makes them able to up-
hold more weight or withstand more pressure than they could
otherwise. Therefore these are individuals who have found that
little something extra which makes for true greatness. Their
                                                                    227

knowledge, wisdom, habits, actions, thoughts, and conversation
are all superior. It is divine will that if one has gifts and talents
one should use them to help nourish and sustain others. If this is
not done, humiliations will result.
Most auspicious: He will be greatly talented, wise, valiant, far-
sighted and energetic. He will be a pillar of the nation, accom-
plishing many things of great merit, and will be respected both
nationally and internationally. He will have a good life.
Least auspicious: He will have a similar life to the most auspicious,
but not to such a high degree. He will be quite valuable wherever
he is assigned or finds himself, and his work and household will
flourish.

   Officer or official          He will be appointed to a high posi-
                                tion.

                                highly favorable reputation.

                                model his house.
Line 5 The withered willow produces blossoms. An older woman
has a young husband. No blame. No praise.

This symbolism stems from the correlation with line 6 (see the
commentary under line 2). Basically, it says that individuals who
wait too long in life to try and accomplish something worthwhile,
when they finally convince themselves that they are ready find
that the persons then willing to join them are of the wrong kind,
so that nothing fruitful results. Such people are not to be blamed
for their late effort, but when nothing truly worthwhile is ac-
complished they cannot be praised either. Such persons demon-
strate dual characteristics throughout their lives, until they
eventually reach a firm decision. Subsequently, they are no
longer flexible.
Most auspicious: Will be vacillating early in life, and later ex-
tremely unyielding. He will enjoy the association of strong but
mean people, but with a good possibility of changing in this
regard later in life. While he will have adequate food and shelter
he will not accomplish anything worthwhile, and hence have no
fame. His actions will not be subject to blame either.
Least auspicious: He is likely to have an older, shrewish, vigorous

Line 6 Fording the stream. The water goes over his head. Mis-
fortune. No personal blame.

In life there are circumstances that demand great effort, courage
and self-sacrifice from a limited few. These persons are adven-
turers and explorers, scientists, engineers, astronauts, etc. They
will have much in common with the early American pioneers. In
combat, they are the leaders of advance units. They are the
master-minds and executors of worthwhile movements, and
their sacrifices pave the way for the less courageous.
Most auspicious: He will have great strength, talent, and courage.
He will be in high positions and face serious dangers, and he will
be righteous and selfless. He may die for his cause and have his
name recorded in history.
Least auspicious: He will be ambitious and will strive with high
intentions, but he will be limited in talent and tend to be reckless
and to act without due consideration, which will result in troubles
and disasters.

Hexagram 29            K'an      ==      The Abyss


SIMPLE        TRANSLATION         OF TEXT
Abyss upon Abyss. Maintaining a sanguine attitude and a stable
mind induces respect, and results in success.

COMMENTARY
Water never stops from its source to the sea. When it meets
obstacles it pauses, builds up until it can go over or around them,
and then proceeds onward. Water is not strong, yet through
continued application it can wear down rocks and metal. It suc-
ceeds in reaching its goal going forward step by step, yet ever true
to itself and its purpose. The words 'abyss upon abyss' refer to the
appearance of the two trigrams, each having a deep ruvine
between mounds of earth. Water flows through these ravines a:.
well as overcoming impediments in its path. Those depicted here
should emulate water and be ever true to themselves in heart and
mind, and firm in their purposes. They should maintain SillI-
guilleness and keep their minds -tuhle. By doing these things they
can attain success upon success, both small and great. Emulating
                                                 3   I   The Predictions-
water is a matter of knowing how to use situations for protection
as well as for advancement. Great wisdom and advantageous
llrogress go with those well versed in the laws of nature applicable
here.
   Those born in the tenth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES    (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line I Abyss upon abyss. In one he encounters a fissure. Mis-
fortune.

Those depicted here have a similar character to that described ill
the commentary for the hexagram as a whole, but regrettably
they have some great weakness of character which drains their
potential or energy. 'A fissure' is indicative of such weakness, in
that fissures let water flow off elsewhere or become absorbed with-
in the ground. This weakness could be gambling, alcohol, sex,
a sport or a pastime, etc., which may not be wrong in other cir-
cumstances but becomes too important to these persons, because
of the extensive degree to which its effects are felt.
Most auspicious: He will recognize the deficiencies within him-
self, and will adjust to them or compensate for them, so that even
though he will have many difficulties his principal goals will
eventually be achieved.
Least auspicious: He will be timid, injudicious, non-analytical
and shy. Fortune will not favor him, and he will find it difficult to
make his own way.

                                 to his reputation.

again. Such obstacles are circumstances beyond one's control, but
in man's progress there are certain lessons he must learn, and
perhaps even repeat, before he is duly qualified to proceed further.
These persons are enjoined to be content with that which is
available and attainable.
Most auspicious: He will be a person of strong character, persever-
ing in his purposes, and doing everything that is necessary to
achieve them. He will be a leader in times of grave necessity for
the nation, and will have the wisdom with which to bring and
keep peace among the people.

 Line J Forward and backward. Abyss upon abyss. He falls into a
pit in the abyss. Do not act.

When there is heavy rain, or snow melts in areas where there are
no regular streams, the water first tries to find its way out through
one abyss after another, flowing back and forth, searching for the
right way to advance. Here the rivulet reaches a pit and no
advancement is possible. The best one can do in such a circum-
stance is to remain true to oneself and not try to accomplish great
things. These persons are apart from the main stream of life, and
have no fixed goals that they are capable of attaining.
Most auspicious: While not being able to assist, lead or guide
others, he is able to sustain himself and his family without serious
troubles.
Least auspicious: He will be very poor, with many hardships all
his life. He will have little or no ambition, yet be critical of
others.

Line 4 A jug of spirits. A bamboo basket of rice, and earthen-
ware bowls. Introduced to him through an opening. His actions
are free from blame.

Remembering that this hexagram refers to an abyss, and that the
fourth line is the position of the minister, this pictures the
minister living next to the king, perhaps in caves in the side of
the abyss, and the minister supplying emergency nourishment to
the ruler through an opening between the two dwellings. These
persons will be in high positions, aware of the needs of their
families, their work, their rulers and their nation, and will give
support freely, generously, sincerely and honestly. They will
do this within due bounds and limits, such that no obligations
accrue. They will not seek any gain from their support.
Most auspicious: He will be quite wise, with his advice sought and
accepted. This advice can be used to advantage, nationally and
internationally. He will be modest, honest and sincere, and will
not seek luxury or fame, but he may obtain both.
Least auspicious: He will find everything easy to accomplish, but
will have insufficient wisdom for great things, and his will will
fluctuate. Hence he will have easy gains and easy losses, some
good fortune and some bad luck, some good years and some bad.
Throughout it all he will still have adequate means to support
himself and his family.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official        He is likely to be appointed to a

 Line 6 Bound with thongs and ropes. R.estrained by a thorn
 hedge. Three years of failures in his quest for a course. Mis-
 fortune.

The individual depicted here, instead of following the flow of the
water, has tried to get out of the abyss by using the sides. He has
become entangled in a hedge of thorns, no doubt there for the
protection of someone else's property or possessions. These indi-
viduals are prone to try quick remedies, quick escapes, and quick
paths to their goals, instead of the longer but safer, proven
methods. They will experience many entanglements and difficul-
ties as a result of their short-sightedness, their fear of moving
forward step by step, and the follies associated with their thinking.
Eventually they can learn the right way to overcome their
difficulties, and make normal progress again.
Most auspicious: It will be beneficial for these individuals to live
in seclusion to the maximum extent practicable, disregarding
                                                 5 / The Predictions
worldly matters, and developing themselves inwardly. Life will
not be easy, but something worthwhile may eventually result.
Least auspicious: He will be quite unfortunate. He will separate
from his family, and have many troubles and insults; he may
even be imprisoned. He will have a short life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He may be arrested, or demoted.
   Business and professional He will have difficulties continu-
                             ously in his enterprise.

                              carceration are likely.

Hexagram      To   Li   ==     Clinging Light (Fire)


SIMPLE      TRANSLATION        OF TEXT
Clinging Light. Persistent correctness advantageous. Success.
Care of the cow. Good fortune.
3   I The   Predictions

COMMENTARY
The trigram Li doubled symbolizes duration of the light. There
are two bright flames, which by perpetuating their brilliance, can
light up the four corners of the earth. For there to be light there
must be something for it to cling to, a medium against which it is
contrasted. 'Care of the cow' symbolizes nourishment and the
protection of docility and usefulness. These persons are men of
strong faith and firm principles to which they adhere in the con-
duct of life. They have the potential to be leaders but are inclined
to be narrow-minded. They tend to become experts in specialized
matters of interest to themselves, at the same time laying a path
for others to follow. They have leanings towards extremes; e.g.
in spiritual matters they may be devoted ascetics or possibly
saints. They perform a very valuable service by being examples to
others. Usually, their actions and lives will become well known,

others and bring good fortune to themselves.

auspicious.

CONTROLLING         LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line I Walking with confused steps. Reverence, care and sin-
cerity evade errors.

Confused steps are invariably made at the beginning of any
enterprise or state of affairs. So it is here at the beginning of
clarity. In general, these persons will be energetic and ambitious,
with a goal of sorts in their minds. They will be diligent in their
efforts yet ever seeking something more, but uncertain as to what
exactly this should be. They will make considerable progress
throughout their lives, but cannot be expected to rise to great
heights.
Most auspicious: He will be reverent and loyal to his obligations,
and responsibilities, and meticulous in their execution. He will
be wise in a limited way, and will seek opportunities to be useful
and of service. He will make modest gains.
Least auspicious: He will also know how to perform his duties, and
will carry them out reasonably well within narrow limits. He
will make many mistakes early in life, but will reform and enjoy
a good life later.

                             jured by a slip or a fall.
Line 2 Yellow Light. Sublime good fortune.

When someone is working with great clarity for someone else,
and doing so fairly and impartially, sublime good fortune can
result. This line is the strong correlate of line 5, the ruler; hence
this man is in a key supporting role, helping to provide good
administration and government through exceptional clarity.
These persons will have the innate ability to see things clearly
and in their proper perspective, at whatever level they may be
operating. Their life will be one of service and benefit to others,
and they will set a good example.
Most auspicious: He will be an advisor to, or an administrator for,
the leader of his country, the local government, or a commercial
enterprise, and thereby help the nation to flourish culturally and
economically. He will be a man of virtue, modesty, gentility and
consideration, following the golden mean. Good fortune will be
his in all phases of his life.
Least auspicious: He will also be a careful and forthright person,
paying close attention to his every activity, whether personal or
professional. He will have an easy and happy life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be honored and rewarded.
    Business and professional He will excel over others when in
                                competition with them.

 Line } In the light of the setting sun the young do not beat their
pots and sing; the old bemoan their age. Misfortune.

In the trigram Li, the bottom line represents sunrise, the middle
line the main part of the day, and the upper line the period of the
setting of the sun. The beauty of sunsets is fluctuating and
transient, and the time bodes of darkness to follow. Hence these
'j   I   The Predictions
persons are inveterately pessimistic, and always think that where
they have been is better than where they are going. They glory in
the past and try to avoid the future, and their energies are spent
in the wrong directions. Tn gene)'al, they are not very helpful to
themselves, their families, 01' 1In)' activity or enterprise wit h
which they are associated.

life of rise and decline, gain and failure, etc., and will act solely in
keeping with the law of change, without striving to overcome it.

serious damage to himself. He may lose any wealth he possesses or
accumulates. He will have an unfortunate family life as well.

These persons have great energy and dynamism when they first
start a new job or any project. They show characteristics of being
truly great but these usually fade away quite quickly. Their
knowledge is limited in scope, their energies are rapidly expended,
and their durability is questionable.
Most auspicious: He will be over ambitious, and unable to hold
any position long, constantly chopping and changing, and hence
never rising very high. Endurance will be lacking in almost every-
thing he does, but despite this he will have an above average
status in life.
Least auspicious: He will not follow the golden mean, and will be
unjust, arrogant, unruly, and offensive. He will have many
difficulties throughout a probably short life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He may try to usurp authority, or
                               at least be suspected of it.
   Business and professional Some quick gains will be made, but
                               he will not be able to enjoy them,

Line 5   Great tears of dismay and regret. Good fortune.

This is the position of the king or ruler. He sees everything with
great clarity, and seeks the best for his country and his enter-
prises. He is very knowledgeable and wise, and understands the
weaknesses and frailties of human nature. He observes the inept
attempts by those who try their best to do right but as yet are not
on the right path. He would like to help each and every person to
improve himself inwardly and outwardly, and he does his best to
set a proper example, and to promulgate such rules and regula-
tions as will best help the maximum number of people.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of great vision and clarity
working for the good of mankind, with his life and actions result-
ing in much harmony. He will be peaceful and gentle in nature,
yet firm in his purposes and goals. He will enjoy a long, rich and
noble life.
Least auspicious: He will have much clarity, but w111lack the
stamina and courage to carry ont what he knows needs to be done.
He is unable to assume the necessary authority to be great and
successful. He will have many hardships, but his senior years will
tend to be smoother through reaping the rewards of some of his
earlier efforts.

boundless since perfection does not exist on this earth. These
persons are filling a definite need in eradicating the wrong rules

tive, in either, or both, civil and military matters, with sufficient
talents and abilities to be a blessing to the nation. He will have a
rich and rewarding life.

Stimulation. Success. Persist in what         IS   right and just. It is
favorable to marry a young wife.

COMMENTARY
Here we have a lake on the top of a mountain, i.e, the trigram Tui
above Ken, indicating the potentiality of great nourishment over
a wide area and a variety of conditions, where the water, when
used, will stimulate growth and development. Some lakes on
mountains are large and of great value. Others are small and of
but little intrinsic worth. All, however, serve useful purposes.
Their value depends on where they are, and their availability for
useful purposes. These persons will have potentialities in what-
ever fields or enterprises they elect to involve themselves. Their
inherent usefulness is great wherever they may be, but it will
depend largely on themselves as to how they want their gifts to
be used. This, of course, will determine the quality and magnitude
of their successes. Working with those full of dynamic energy
will prove favorable.
   Those born in the first month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING        LINES     (FROM   BOTTOM        TO TOP)
Line   1   Stimulation of the big toe.

The lake over the mountain, as it is used in the hexagram, is also
symbolic of man. A man's progress in movement begins with the
big toe. The lowest line in this hexagram is also the foot of the
mountain, so we therefore have the beginning of stimulation,
with its consequent influence. Since it is only the big toe it is not
of great consequence, and as yet the 'stimulation' is neither good
nor bad. Matters are more or less still in the planning stage, and
these persons will, by and large, be planners on a modest scale.
The number of actions that they initiate will be small.
Most auspicious: He is likely to be born into a family of low
                                                                        241

status, and he will be ambitious to rise above his background. He
has the power to make good plans, but his influence will not be
great, and hence his achievements will be modest. He will enjoy
a more substantial life in his later years.
r .east auspicious: In general, his plans will exceed his capabili-
ties, and he will not be successful. He will leave his horne in
middle age; however, he will not be a pauper.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official        Only slow progress will be made.
    Business and professional Modest expansions may be bene-
                                ficial.
    Ordinary people            Plans will tend to go awry. Stick to
                               known methods and procedures.
Line 2 Stimulation in the calves of the legs. Misfortune. Wait-
ing brings good fortune.

The calves achieve nothing by themselves, i.e. they represent
followers. Their stimulation alone is of little purpose unless it
serves higher aims and goals. In general, these persons have a
specialized function which they must use to cooperate in a larger
enterprise. They are vital cogs in the machinery as a whole.
Most auspicious: He will be well qualified to perform his as-
signed duties, and will have a keen sense of timing, especially
relating to initiating actions and following them up. He will have
a pleasant personality and an innate goodness of character. His life
will be free from disasters, and will be quite favorable in many
aspects.
Least auspicious: He will be selfish, egotistical, greedy and over
ambitious. He will face many troubles in supporting himself and
his family.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Those who remain at the center of
                                activity will fare well. Those sent

Line)     Stimulation of the thighs. He holds close to whom he
follows. Continuing will lead to regret.

The divine Creator would like everyone to have independence
within limits. Here the thighs are following on the torso so closely
that there is no room for independence. Hence, this situation is
like that of a man following the lead of his wife, or following rules
and regulations too literally, without exercising judgment
regarding intentions and thereby being inflexible in thought and
opinions. Unless these persons amend their thoughts, words and
deeds they will have cause for regret.
Most auspicious: He will not be very independent, but will know
when to advance and when to stop. He will do well in a sub-
ordinate position of leadership, where the execution of the pro-
mulgated policies and procedures is vital. In general, he will be
free from major mistakes.
Least auspicious: He will be good at planning, but his execution
will leave much to be desired. He will do well working [or some-
one else, but will fail if he proceeds independently.

                                are to be expected.
   Ordinary people              He will fare well by adhering to
                                normal leadership.
Line 4 Persistence in correctness results in good fortune. Re-
morse vanishes. Agitations and inconsistencies; vacillations. Only
those on whom he concentrates follow.

This line is the ruler of this hexagram, and the place of the heart
is indicated. The external results one attains are the product of
the inner self, i,e. the influence and actions stemming from the
heart. If these are correct they stimulate all, impartially. How-
ever, if one pursues narrow goals only those on whom one men-
tally concentrates will follow (by telepathic stimulation). These
persons will, on the whole, exert much influence on their sur-
roundings, their associates and their families. The quality of their
endeavors will depend on their inner worth and the goals they set
themselves.

    high position, establishing progress and order to the satisfaction
    of a great many people. He will have a good and rewarding
    life.
    Least auspicious: He will be muddle-headed, and will taste the
    toil and hardships of a normal struggle for existence. His influence
    will be local only, yet of value, since he is inwardly striving for
    what is right and just.

    Line 5 Stimulation of the shoulder muscles. No regret.

    These muscles exert little influence by themselves, but they pro-
    tect the vital spinal column and the associated nerves. Hence
    these individuals may be found in such positions as treasurer,
    public accountant, quality controller, or in any other position
    which helps protect the vital elements and communication net-
    works in government, business or industry.
    Most auspicious: He will have lofty aims and will carry them
    out with the support and backing of his superiors. He will possess
    great fortitude and be quite imperturbable; he will consider that
    he has a good life.

Hexagram J2           Himg    ==   Constancy (Enduring)


SIMPLE       TRANSLATION       OF TEXT
Constancy. Success. No error. With righteousness and correctness,
firm progress advantageous.

COMMENTAIl        Y
Here we have the eldest son, Chen, leading the eldest daughter,
Sun. Chen is firm and Sun is yielding. Thus they are in perfect
harmony and equilibrium. This signifies constancy and durability,
like the motion of the heavenly bodies in the universe. Each has
its own orbit; each exerts a constant degree of influence, and each
sheds light according to its strength. All exhibit a constancy
throughout their existence. They perform their roles with ease,
and no errors result from their actions. Those born under this
hexagram have the potential to manifest these qualities of the
heavenly bodies throughout their lives, through the exercise of
righteousness and through making progress in pursuit of their
goals. Being human they will probably show weakness and
vacillation occasionally, but in the end they will arrive at what-
ever destination they have set for themselves.
   Those born in the first month will be more auspicious.

them, one soon destroys them. Only proper cultural activities are
beneficial. Regrettably, most of these persons will strive for
quick results by taking short cuts. These individuals are likely to
be egotistical, conceited, opinionated, and impetuous, and thereby,
on the whole, unable to make correct and proper evaluations.
Most auspicious: A few will know how to judge actual situations
 and make appropriate plans before taking action, and will there-
fore be able to achieve modest results and a good life.

with their lives; they will tend to act without due deliberation,

 and he _will have a long, rich and rewarding life.
 Least auspicious: He will also have a beneficial life without mis-
 fortune, but on a lower level or smaller scale. He will be honored
 locally, and have a good family life and adequate means.
~I         The Predictions
     In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official         He should be careful and meticu-
                                   lous, and he will have a good year.
       Business and professional He should devote much effort to
                                   self-improvement, with beneficial
                                   external effects.
       Ordinary people             He will have a good year, with no
                                   extremes.
     Line}     His constancy wavers and he meets with disgrace.
     Continuation will lead to regret.

     Weak-willed and vacillating individuals are depicted here. They
     are easily led by others, and change their desires and goals
     frequently. To them the grass always seems greener on the other
     side, and they live in day-dreams rather than reality. Prolonged
     activity of this sort leads nowhere, hence, regrets result.
     Most auspicious: He is unable to hold what is right, and hence is
     constantly criticized and jeered at. His life will be troubled.
     Least auspicious: He will be impervious to all that is good, and
     he will become infamous.
     In yearly hexagram:
        Officer or official         He will probably be demoted or dis-
                                    missed.
        Business and professional He will receive reprobation if
                                    guilty of using shady methods.
        Ordinary people              Disputes and lawsuits are likely.
     Line 4 No game in the field.

     One cannot find something which is not there to be found. If you
     want to make money, for example, you must go to where the
     money is. If you want to go skiing, you must first go and find
     some snow. These persons are fairly gifted in childhood, but their
     impracticality keeps them from advancing, and they will possibly
     also lose whatever advantage they had. They are envious of their
     neighbors and try to outdo them by wrong means. Their aims and
     purposes are invariably erroneous.
     Most auspicious: He may make money and obtain a favorable pos-
     ition by uncommon means or skills, but his fortune will not last long.
     Least auspicious: He will have a humble and mundane existence.

  Business and professionalHe will fail to make any substantial
                           gains.
  Ordinary people          He will expend much effort with-
                           out deriving any great benefits.
Line 5 Maintaining enduring constancy brings good fortune to
a woman but is wrong for a man.

The symbolism is that it is right for a wife to follow the lead of her
husband through thick and thin, and brings good fortune to the
couple. Conversely, such action on the part of the man, i.e. being
an unquestioning follower, an obsequious person or a yes-man, is
the wrong procedure to follow for a successful life. To advance this
man must be an independent thinker, adjusting to changing
circumstances and always ready to take action according to the
dictates of the situation, yet keeping his goals constantly in sight.
Most auspicious: He will receive help from his wife or a female
member of his family which will enable him to establish himself
in a moderately good position and circumstances.
Least auspicious: He will let others assume authority and hence
will never attain any substantial responsibility. He will not be able
to make adequate plans, and those that he does make will never
materialize or are of no real importance. He is likely to have a
nagging, shrewish wife.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be blamed for making
                                flattering   reports rather      than
                                presenting actual facts.
   Business and professional If he attempts to advance sur-
                                reptitiously he will be found out,
                                and blame will accrue.
   Ordinary people              He will receive blame for matters
                                that are not entirely his fault.
Line 6 A constancy of nervous agitation results in misfortune.

This line reflects the most extreme state of impatience and agi-
tated behavior. This person cannot wait for a natural sequence of
events to take place, and is constantly striving for hasty culmina-
tions and foreknowledge of final results instead of relying on
proper analysis, good judgment and experience.
5    I   The Predictions
Most auspicious: He will be wise and strong enough to curb and
overcome his natural propensity towards recklessness and agita-
tion. He will control his impatience to within due limits, and the
result will be an average life with few troubles.
Least auspicious: He will be unable to curb his eagerness and
recklessness. He will try to do some good occasionally but, on the
whole, will accomplish little. Sometimes he will display un-
seemly behaviour and as a result have trouble with his superiors.
In yearly hexagram:
   For everyone                A year of impatient and rash
                               actions, with no truly fruitful
                               results.

KEYNOTES
1.   Do not seek lasting results hastily.
2.   Follow the golden mean.
3.   Vacillations end in disaster.
4.   Search only where one's quarry can be found.
5.   The creative must lead for success.
6.   Indecisiveness is dangerous.

CONDENSATIONS           FOR   DAILY   CYCLES
1. Do not be hasty. Allow things to develop according to their
nature.
2. Following the golden mean will produce the results you want.
3. Vacillation and inconsistency lead to humiliation and disgrace.
4. One cannot attain the unattainable, nor that which is not
meant for one.
5. Be creative and lead in a superior manner. Constantly follow-
ing leads only to misfortune.
6. Indecisiveness, especially in a position of authority, will
result in nothing worthwhile being accomplished. Sometimes
even a wrong decision resulting in some action is better than no
decision at all.

COMMENTARY
The symbolism is derived from the motion of the two trigrams
and the nature of the inner hexagram. The trigram Ch'ien,
heaven, which moves upward, is over the trigram K8n, mountain,
which stands still. The inner hexagram shows a return of small
matters. The Chinese set great store by being wise like Ch'ien,
and also by retiring from difficult and inflexible situations like
Ken, whereby through their silence or lack of contact both parties
can save face. The meaning of such actions is well understood by
the persons concerned, and the key to success is the wisdom with
which the right moment for retirement is chosen and imple-
mented. Persons exhibiting these traits can be found in all walks
of life and at all levels. These persons will have a natural propen-
sity for, or the potential to, retire intuitively when in straits,
sometimes to regather strength and subsequently renew the
struggle, and at others they will make the withdrawal perma-
nent. Their actions constitute wisdom and not cowardliness.
Naturally some cowardice will be found in less auspicious persons
and sometimes their withdrawals are endeavors for personal gain
rather than for the over-all good of the situation. Strength of will
and character are needed as well as wisdom in order to use the
retirement most propitiously.
   Those born in the sixth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM    TO    TOP)
Line   I Retiring at the tail. The position is dangerous. No goals
should be sought.

This line is the foot of the mountain and at the tail end of retire-
ment. The time and position are not right for any advancement,
hence goals should not be sought (externally). Being at the tail
is obviously a dangerous position in any withdrawal. In addition,
the base of the mountain is solid and stodgy. The two symbols
combined imply a certain lack of wisdom, judgment and dynamic
energy. For the most part, too, these persons will let others do the
leading.
Most auspicious: He will have hardships early in life, but will
enjoy a good and easy life later. He will start in a humble position,
but subsequently will attain and enjoy a respected position.
3   I   The Predictions
Least auspicious: He will be full of fears and worry all the time,
and have many hardships. He will be unable to establish himself
well, even if appropriately helped by others.
In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official          Retreat at the right moment.
  Business and professional Retreat and regroup forces.
   Ordinary people            Live peacefully and contentedly,
                               and troubles will be avoided.
Line 2 He holds fast to thongs of yellow oxhide which cannot
be parted.

This person is like the center of the mountain, which cannot be
torn apart by men. Line 2 is a Yin line, holding fast to its correlate
line 5, a Yang. Both lines are in their proper places, and strong in
their own way. Small individuals are indicated, who look up to
some live person as their idol or guide, or admire and use the
biography of some famous individual as a model. Once their
minds are made up their beliefs are strong and unshakeable.
Those amongst them who are wise, diligent, analytical and dis-
cerning will benefit greatly from such strength of mind, and at
the same time they will be flexible in adjusting readily to new
conditions.
Most auspicious: He will be full of virtues and will follow the
golden mean. He will be unshakeable in his purposes, and will
choose his associates carefully, staying away from inferiors. He
will attain a good administrative position at a national or local
level.
Least auspicious: He will be lazy and undiscerning. He will
select the wrong characteristics of his superiors and predecessors
to emulate, and his accomplishments will be few.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will find himself in a position of
                                setting forth policies.
   Business and professional He        will   make      advancements
                               through writings or advertisements.
   Ordinary people              He will achieve a modest increase
                                in his personal property. If content
                                with his situation he will have a
                                good year.
Line}      Retiring under constraint brings ills and dangers.
                                              3   I   The Predictions
Maintaining (or supporting) servants and concubines brings good
fortune.

The symbolism stems from the hexagram as a whole retiring
(from the bottom to the top), and this being the first Yang line,
supported and urged forward by the two Yin lines below, while
having strong Yang lines above it. Average individuals are in-
dicated, but ones who have the weakness of 'hiding behind their
mothers' skirts' or letting someone else protect them, being un-
able to stand up and defend themselves adequately on their
own. However, helping those below them will prove especially
beneficial and bring good fortune.
Most auspicious: He will be a clever man, who retreats to avoid
troubles and dangers. He will probably be helped frequently by a
female (perhaps a member of his family) or by those dependent
on him. He will not be very dependable when the going is
rough, but he will try to help others occasionally, with moderate
success.
Least auspicious: He will be absorbed in trying to live a life of
ease, liking to associate with, and frequently supported by,
females. He will not adhere to accepted standards, and although
he will express some consideration for others, he will not be very
effective.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will strive for favor or ad-
                               vancement, but not always in the
                               right way.
   Business and professional He will win some support and
                               favors, mainly from those under
                               him.
   Ordinary people             His wife will be very helpful,
                               especially when troubles develop.
                               He may be quite ill or in difficult
                               straits for part of the year. He may
                               increase the size of his family.
Line 4 Voluntary retreat. Beneficial to the superior man. Mis-
fortune for the inferior man.

Here in the position of the minister (the fourth line) retreating
and withdrawing from situations is a matter of sound judgment,
3   I   The Predictions
with the interests of the ruler and the people in mind. Acquiescing
in such circumstances, while maintaining the dignity and poise
befitting one's station, brings good fortune. These knowledgeable
and experienced persons will present their points of view in a
superior manner, and once a firm decision has been made, will
carry out that decision in a distinguished way, from which good
fortune accrues.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of high ideals, of broad
vision and eminent ability, starting on his chosen career early in
life, and advancing rapidly and courageously by his merit. He will
keep away from unnecessary difficulties and disasters, and will
have a long and good life.
Least auspicious: He will be in a low position, and be obse-
 quious and sycophantic. His abilities will be poor. He may become
 disgusted over his failure to advance, and retire from worldly
 activity and vegetate.
 In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official          He should retire to avoid troubles.
    Business and professional Circumstances will not be propi-
                                 tious for advancement.
    Ordinary people              He may receive help from others
                                 which will later prove to be a
                                 source of trouble and difficulties.
 Line 5 A praiseworthy retreat. Perseverance brings good fortune.

This is the position of the leader or ruler, who, according to the
Chinese, should exemplify heavenly and spiritual qualities as
well as worldly leadership. The meaning of this line is that a
complete withdrawal from worldly influences, in order to follow
the will of heaven, is praiseworthy, and that the pursuit of such a
course will bring good fortune and should therefore be continued.
These are persons who discern, or learn, that there is more to life
than mere surface appearances. They study and learn the laws of
heaven and earth within their capability, and apply them for the
benefit of themselves and others wherever they are.
Most auspicious: He will be a man who upholds virtue, with
high morals and correct principles. He will turn away from way-
wardness to travel the right path, and his life will be an example
and a blessing to others.
Least auspicious: He will also follow a just and middle way,
                                                3   I   The Predictions
resulting in an easy yet beneficial life. He will not be ambitious in
a worldly sense, and he will not suffer hardships or insults.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He can expect promotion in status
                               or responsibility.
   Business and professional He will gain considerably in status
                               and reputation.
   Ordinary people              A generally good year.
Line 6 Honorable withdrawal. Everything favorable.

Here, at the top of the hexagram, the withdrawal is complete. All
external impediments have been discarded, and the right inner
way has been found, from which external good comes by itself.
These persons will be found in many walks of life. They will
know that the rendering of service to others is a part of the will of
the Creator, and they will not strive for gain with selfish or
egotistical motives. Their purpose will mainly be to help others,
using their own capacities to the maximum.
Most auspicious: He will be fortunate in all aspects of life, having
good health, a good position, and adequate wealth. He will follow
the golden mean, and will not be concerned about position or
esteem; these will come to him automatically. His decisions will
always be sound and beneficial.
Least auspicious: He will also have a good life with ample
remuneration. He will have no special glory or achievements, yet
no great difficulties either. He will be helpful to others.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will probably retire.
   Business and professional He should patiently wait for con-
                                ditions to improve.
   Ordinary people             He will gain some profit, and all
                               will go well.

Hexagram J4       Ta Chuang      =-=     The Power of the Great


SIMPLE    TRANSLATION          OF TEXT
The Power of the Great. Persistence in what is right advantageous.

COMMENTARY
The trigram Chen, the energy of spring, is in the realm of heaven,
and consequently there is great power generated, hence the name
of the hexagram. This is also depicted in the four strong Yang
lines rising and about to replace the upper two Yin lines. In its
visual appearance the hexagram is like a ram, with the four Yang
lines being the body and the two Yin lines the horns. Strength is
the main characteristic depicted here. This must be coupled with
wisdom to be appropriate and beneficial. Hence the statement that
persistence in what is right is advantageous. As will be noted in
the commentaries on the individual lines, the degree of auspi-
ciousness is determined by how the power is used. Some of these
individuals will be stubborn to an obnoxious degree. Others will
merely be adamant in what they think is right. Many will
demonstrate their power as persistence in attaining objectives,
regardless of whether the objective is right or wrong. A few will
use their strength for improving themselves, while even fewer
will use it for the benefit of others. The power referred to here is
primarily an inner strength, although physical strength and
vitality are indicated too.

Line   IPower in the toes. It would be unfortunate           to try to
advance now. Quiet confidence remains.

A man's forward movement commences in the toes. This line is
somewhat similar to the first line of hexagram 31. There the
dominant trait was influence, while here it is strength. In this
lowest position, the strength is likely to be used without adequate
preparations, and result in rashness and brashness. To try to
advance under such circumstances would lead to misfortune.
These persons, however, also have the potential for knowing their
limitations, so the wise ones will wait for the most propitious
occasions. These persons are likely to be impetuous, headstrong,
impulsive, adventurous, indiscreet, ardent and fiery.
Most auspicious: He will be wise and talented, with common
sense and good judgment. He will curb his impulses and wait for
the right moment to act, and therefore will not become involved
in any serious trouble. He will protect his enterprises, family and
possessions well.
Least auspicious: He will act rashly, without due preparations
or consideration. He will have many hardships, and end up being
poor.

                               and persistence.

                               probable, in an adverse year. He

right course externally is already inwardly correct. This is
indicated by this being the central line in the creative trigram
Ch'ien, heavan. This person naturally brings blessings and bene-
fits to whatever he engages in. Such persons are supported by
heaven and intuitively do what is right and best for the cir-
cumstances in which they find themselves. The world is blessed
by there being a few such people wherever one goes.
Most auspicious: He will follow the golden mean, and will know
how to make corrections and bring about reforms propitiously.
He will be in a high and influential position, benefiting a great
number of people.
Least auspicious: He will also be a firm and steady leader and
administrator, but on a local level. He will have a modest but
good life.

 Line} The small man uses adverse power. The superior man is
 reserved. Persistence in the use of strength now would be serious,
 much like a ram butting against a hedge and getting his horns
 entangled.

At the top of the trigram Ch'ien, the mentally weak man is in-
clined to use all his power, without guiding it judiciously, and the
result is 'like a ram butting against a hedge and getting his horns
entangled.' The hexagram as a whole is symbolic of the ram, so
here an inferior man is using every means, both good and bad, to
achieve his aims. Naturally a superior man does not act in such a
manner. The position of this line is such that the traits of the
inferior man predominate.
"Mostauspicious: He will be a good man, but shallow with re-
spect to worldly conditions and his responsibilities regarding them.
Therefore, for the most part, he will be unable to handle matters

correct procedures, are bound to find that troubles disintegrate of
their own accord, with good fortune ensuing. The cart is ready to
move, so when entanglements are overcome the time is propitious
for further advancement. This procedure is obviously a wise one
for every stage of one's life's journey. The success of these indi-
viduals depends on their starting point, and thereafter on their
use of their innate wisdom. Since his line is in the position of the
minister, these persons will either support some noble person or
some worthy cause.
Most auspicious: He will always follow a righteous and just
course, and nothing can prevent his progress. He will help him-
self, his enterprises, his family, and the general public as well. He
will begin to build merit, reputation and wealth in his early
youth. and he will have a long and favorable life.
Least auspicious: He will also have a good and beneficial life.
His strong desires will be achieved easily, and his household and
enterprises will flourish modestly.

3 / The Predictions
  Business and professional  Forward movement is beneficial,
                             and good results can be expected.
   Ordinary people           The year will be favorable for new
                             actions and efforts.
Line 5 He readily sacrifices his ram. No regret.

Broadminded individuals see things from an impersonal point
of view, and readily sacrifice their own desires and wishes for the
benefit of the greater whole. In the main, these persons are
leaders and managers, this being the fifth line, and have the
potential for acquiring the requisite knowledge and experience to
overcome difficulties and bring about better conditions for others
and their enterprises. Regrettably this is a Yin line where it
should really be a strong Yang for the best results. Hence, many
of these persons will not be the stalwart leaders they ought to be.
Most auspicious: He will be a calm and soft-spoken leader, who
can readily quell violence and disorders through the implementa-
tion of just rules and procedures, which others accept and follow.
He will operate mainly on a local level rather than nationally or
internationally.
Least auspicious: He will be timid and weak. Although he will
know what needs to be done he will be hesitant to put the right
course into effect. He will have but few long term gains, and a
short life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Many will be reprimanded for in-
                                adequately carrying out their re-
                                sponsibilities.
   Business and professional His reputation will probably wane.
   Ordinary people              He will have many small troubles.
                                He may possibly die.
Line 6 The ram butts against the hedge. Movement in any
direction impossible. Recognizing and re-evaluating the situation
brings good fortune.

People universally dislike anyone who uses excessive power,
regardless of the level on which such a person is operating. These
persons have the propensity to use excessive power. The result is
that no one wants to support them, cooperate with them, or to
come to their aid. Consequently, no matter what they try to do
260
                                              3   I   The Predictions
they get nowhere. However, if they recognize this failing, and
re-evaluate their situation, they have the potential to change and
gradually attain good fortune. This can best be accomplished by
their exercising calmness in their activities, by quietly improving
their academic knowledge, and through observation and analysis
in their profession.
Most auspicious: He will be sufficiently wise and knowledgeable
to know when to act and when to remain quiet. The use of this
sense of timing will prove advantageous, and substantial gains
and advancements will be made.
Least auspicious: He will be over ambitious, with but little
talent or wisdom. This is dangerous. He will also be greedy, and
will try unsuccessfully to outdo his peers and superiors, creating
enmity. He will frequently be in trouble.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will probably be dismissed.
   Business and professional His enterprises will require re-
                                assessment and re-evaluation before
                                any success can be expected.
   Ordinary people              He is likely to push matters too
                                hard, with adverse results.
KEYNOTES
1.   Rashness is dangerous.
2.   A right course should always be followed, for advantages.
3.   Small-mindedness results in entanglements.
4.   Caution is advised when using power.
5.   Never be too pushful.
6.   An excessive use of power induces adverse reactions.

CONDENSATIONS        FOR   DAILY   CYCLES
1. Using too much power at the beginning of any enterprise is
dangerous. Exercise care.
2. The influences are correct. Resistance begins to disappear.
3. You may be trying to use too much strength for your position.
4. Your strength and influence can be used to advantage now,
but be careful not to overdo it.
5. Give up using excessive strength. Use only the right amount,
duly guided.
6. You may have gone too far. Re-evaluate and redirect your
efforts as necessary, and good fortune can still be yours.

3   I The Predictions
Hexagram}j       Chin   ==   Progress (Advance)

SIMPLE     TRANSLATION     OF TEXT
Progress. The noble prince is honored with a great many horses.
He is granted audience three times in a day.

COMMENTARY
Light, the trigram Li, is over the earth, the trigram K'un. This
represents the brilliance of the heavenly heart and heavenly mind
of man. Since K'un also represents the people, it indicates that
light is available to guide them. In a ruler or leader it shows
wisdom, knowledge, magnanimity, confidence, and freedom from
jealousy. These are truly kingly persons, in the best meaning of
the word. Lesser men are like noble princes, who support their
ruler with fealty for the good of the country. They are rewarded
generously (horses were scarce in ancient China). These persons
lead in external matters, while in inner wisdom they are an
example to others. Their external lives are a reflection of their
internal worth and greatness. As a ruler or leader one welcomes
such noble princes, is glad to see them frequently, and rewards
them freely for their support and advice. Those who are truly
great reflect the glory and virtue of heaven.
   Those born in the second month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line   J  Held back in progress. Perseverance brings good fortune.
Meet lack of confidence in others with liberality towards them.
No error.

In trying to enlighten the lower strata of the people (the bottom
line of the trigram K'un) one often runs into difficulty by such
persons being inadequately prepared, or literally incapable of
receiving the message or teachings. Persevering, as well as being
liberal-minded regarding deficiencies, is the right course. These
persons are likely to be teachers or instructors who deal with a
considerable number of people needing training or illumination.
They will be quite knowledgeable, teaching with calmness,
patience and persistence. They may be, but need not be, pro-
fessional teachers.
Most auspicious: He will be a person of firm resolve and noble
262
                                                 5   I   The Predictions
in character. He will be just, dealing with others without favorit-
ism. He will exercise great self-discipline, and his affairs will
always be in good order, and progressive.
Least auspicious: He will try to achieve his goals without proper
preparations or cooperation, and will meet with frequent hin-
drances. He will not accomplish anything great, and is likely to
have a short life without much satisfaction.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He may: be stopped in his progress
                                by evil people.
   Business and professional He should hold firm in the present
                                situation.
   Ordinary people              Foresight is lacking, so it is difficult
                               to make any progress.
Line 2 Sorrowful in his progress. Righteous persistence brings
good fortune. Blessings are bestowed by one's ancestress.

The meaning of this line is quite similar to that of line 1, except
that the teaching is on a higher level. The persons depicted here
are sorrowful because their own progress does not seem to be what
it ought to be, nor does that of others. They instantly recognize
the great many things that need to be done, but their helpers are
few. Most other people are uncaring. Persistence in what is right
will eventually bring good fortune. This line is the correlate of
line 5, a Yin line, so one is supported by one's ancestress (a
female who has gone before).
Most auspicious: He will be in an influential position, and con-
cerned about the future of his country and its people, if they are
not pursuing wise and judicious courses. He will be firm in his
goals and strive persistently to fulfil them. He will follow the
golden mean. In the end he will be rewarded, and will receive
good fortune from an external source, perhaps from a woman.
Least auspicious: He will also be a person striving to follow the
right path and achieve that which he knows to be for the good.
He will have many changes in his life, some sorrowful and some
joyful. He will be auspiciously helped by his mother, or by another
woman.
In yearly hexagram:

  Ordinary people            His desires will be fulfilled. Also he
                             will be helped by his mother or his
                             wife, or by their respective families.
Line)   All are in accord. Remorse vanishes.

Here a man has progressed high on the earthly plane (line 3 of the
trigram K'un) and is now ready to investigate the illumination
and enlightenment attainable from heaven (the upper trigram
Li, clarity, above the earth). The inner light is strong in this man,
and attracts others without conscious effort. Through diligence in
what is right he maintains his inner strength, and thereby attains
successful results for his efforts. His accomplishments will cause
any previous occasions for remorse to be forgotten. These persons
have magnetic personalities.
Most auspicious: He will have many like-minded friends and
associates, who work to improve themselves and to be of benefit to
others. Their results are truly successful, and blessings accrue for
all concerned.
Least auspicious: He will also be a good man associating with
wise and good people. He will have some helpful friends and few
enemies, and his life will be quite easy and progressive in a modest
way. No great sorrows or worries are anticipated.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will experience a happy and in-
                                vigorating promotion.
   Business and professional He will be successful, and will be
                                recommended by others.
   Ordinary people              He will work with friends and
                                achieve his aims.
Line 4 Marmot-like progress. Perseverance is hazardous.

Americans would speak of prairie-dog-like progress, since that
animal is the closest American relation of the marmot. The
prairie-dog lives within a limited territory, and needs the com-
panionship of others; it acts like an emperor over his domain, yet
runs to its burrow when danger threatens, and in general makes
little or no progress. People exhibiting such characteristics will
2640
                                               3   I The Predictions
find many hazards in the course of their lives, with others taking
advantage of these innocuous characteristics. Their progress will
be very limited unless they become more dynamic.
Most auspicious: He will be in a high position, but since he does
not have the qualities of a true leader, he will be envied by others
and disparaged, and will find the maintaining of his status and
position difficult.
Least auspicious: He will be a troublesome man with little or no
virtue, sometimes even vicious or obnoxious. He will have a
difficult life, with few or no achievements.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          His progress and efforts will be
                                constantly thwarted.
   Business and professional He will be stalemated, and unable
                                to find a way to progress.
   Ordinary people              He will have many unavoidable
                                disputes.
Line 5 Regrets disappear. No need for concern regarding gains
or losses. Keep advancing. All things cooperate favorably.

These persons are truly kingly and noble in character, and every-
thing automatically flows to them, by virtue of their great and
righteous inner selves which act as a light for the world. These
persons are approaching sainthood in their evolution, and may be
found in any walk of life where the Creator feels they will be
most useful.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of great virtue, knowledge-
able in cultural matters and in the arts. He will be independent
but will serve others well if needs be. He will not strive for merit,
yet will achieve it; he will not seek profits, yet will make con-
tinuous gains. He will not necessarily deliberately work for re-
forms or to improve the people, but these things will automatically
come about wherever he is.
Least auspicious: He will also be a man of good character and
wide knowledge. He also will not concern himself with gains
or losses, yet everything will go as he wishes, on a modest
scale.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will advance in status or posi-

     The time is past being propitious (line 5 was the most propitious)
     for rapid and smooth advancement. Here, trying to make forceful
     progress is wrong, except in so far as it concerns correcting and
     improving oneself in character and knowledge. All self-correction
     should be made courageously and with thoroughness. Care should
     be exercised that what is done is right and just. By trying to
     correct anyone other than oneself one will encounter difficulties.
     Others must develop and improve their own leadership, for
     effective results.
     Most auspicious: He will be able to make modest gains only. In
     general, he will be too stern, adamant and inflexible for great
     responsibilities. He may become the mayor of a small town, or the
     administrator of an enterprise. His auspiciousness will be meager,
     yet no great harm will come to him either.
     Least auspicious: He will be merciless and cruel, without any
     natural affection, and will be very touchy and ready to engage in
     disputes. He may become an officer or an administrator, of low
     rank.
     In yearly hexagram:

Hexagram}6        Ming I   ==      Darkening of the Light


SIMPLE     TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
Darkening of the Light. Persevering despite hindrances or ad-
versity bring rewards.

COMMENTARY
The symbol of the darkening of the light comes from observation
of the hexagram itself, where Li, light, is under (within) K'un,
the earth. The light is thus hidden and is therefore darkened ex-
ternally.
   The lessons one has to learn during the course of one's evolu-
tion are many and varied. Here, potentially strong and good
persons are faced with many hindrances and adversities, so that
they cannot directly be of benefit to others, just as King W~n was
held in captivity before the time was ripe for him to escape and
take over the throne of China. People of lesser status often find
themselves in situations where all their endeavors seem to be in
vain, Or something inevitably occurs to keep their desires from
                                                                267
5   I   The Predictions
materializing. In such times one must veil one's light, and let
silent inner strength take over. Eventually good will prevail.
Basically, these persons are of good character, and will try to do
their best according to the dictates of the circumstances in which
they find themselves. Observe how a mother veils her light, and
puts herself on the level of the child she is teaching. Superior
persons in any position will do well to emulate the mother's good
example.
   Those born in the eighth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING         LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Lines I Wounding of the light during flight. He lowers his
wings. When pursuing a goal the superior man may go without
eating for three days. The master will have something to say
about this.

Many birds, in nature's world, will droop their wings and feign
injury, even though only slightly hurt, in order to escape danger.
Here, at the bottom of the hexagram, the light is only slightly
wounded, and attempts to protect itself following nature's ex-
ample. A man likewise will sometimes withdraw from his
struggles and, symbolically, go without food for three days,
making others think that he is incapable of fending for himself.
The master will verify what he is doing. Others may often speak
disparagingly about his actions and apparent weaknesses, yet in
reality he follows a wise and fortuitous course, Some of these
persons develop themselves so effectively in their quiet way that
nearly everyone else is surprised when they are chosen for promo-
tion and positions of responsibility.
Most auspicious: He will be a wise, knowledgeable and ex-
perienced man, who knows how to protect himself and others. He
will be honest, trustworthy and sincere, and therefore free from
blame. In times of peace he will be in a high administrative posi-
tion. In times of anarchy and disorder he will be in a position of
authority to quell the disturbances and restore order. He will have
an active life and face many dangers, but will avoid disaster.
Least auspicious: He will be quite ambitious, will meet hin-
drances often, and he will establish some merit but will never be
wealthy. He will feign illnesses, etc., in order to gain sympathy
and control over others.

                             buy property.
Line 2 Darkening of the light. Wounded in the left thigh.
Horses come to his aid. Good fortune.

Line 5, the center line of trigram K'un, earth, and the correlate
of line 2, tries to control the latter, being the center line of
trigram Li, light, but only succeeds in inflicting a disabling wound
in the thigh. Despite the wound the man depicted here can still
ride, so he uses horses in effecting deliverance of himself and those
dependent on him. Horses represent mobility and flexibility,
under the control of wisdom, adjusting to time and circum-
stances. These persons are likely to be in medical, legal or certain
scientific careers, or in the military service as officers.
Most auspicious: He has dignity, power and analytical ability,
in both his professional and personal lives. He will try to cultivate
the right way and follow it courageously. He will be in charge of
an important enterprise whereby evil will be kept away from
many people.
Least auspicious: He will have sufficient ability and experience
to attain his aims, but at times will exhibit outrageous be-
havior and treat others cruelly. He is likely to have many
troubles.

rebel leader is captured. Do not expect corrections to be made all
at once. Excesses must be avoided.

The trigram Li, light, and south, seeks to rise, in the natural
course of events, and in doing so encounters the trigram K'un,
which represents the south-west. K'un also signifies a multitude of
people. It is only natural that one runs into trouble if one tries to
bring light to many people at once. Furthermore, the most
difficult thing to impart to people is the need to break away from
the old and inject something new. Habit is strong, and overcoming
it is no simple task. While these persons know what ought to be
done, their position (line 3) is such that it is definitely not right
for them to try it in practice. Judiciousness and caution are ad-
vised regarding all actions, but this advice quite probably will not
be followed.
Most auspicious: He will be a leader and a rabble-rouser, trying
to promote change to overcome long-standing ills but without
much success. He will have frequent disputes with others. How-
ever, his personal life may be quite satisfying.
Least auspicious: He will be a demagogue, with poor judgment,
resulting in a life full of constant difficulties in every department.

 Line 4 He penetrates the left side of the belly and enters the
 heart of the darkening of the light. He leaves by the gates of the
courtyard .

.A period of rest and revitalization is indicated here. The light
 spirit normally occupies the area above and behind the space
 between the eyes. During rest it reverts to the liver, i.e, in the
 area of the belly, so in this line the lower trigram Li is entering
 the belly of trigram K'un. Furthermore, Li tends to rise while
 K'un tends to sink, and this also serves to effect a union. After the

light revitalizes itself in the liver it will return to its normal posi-
tion, leaving the belly 'courtyard' by the gates of returning
consciousness and energy. These persons will be calm and restful
individuals, who quietly bide their time, gathering strength and
waiting for the right moment to act, then being very effective in
achieving whatever they seek when they do take action.
Most auspicious: He will be in a high administrative position,
probably in the government. Will be wise, knowledgeable and
judicious, with a keen sense of timing. He will ably support his
country, his enterprise, and his family.
Least auspicious: He will use his talents for selfish purposes. He
will possess little virtue and be inclined to trickery, cunning and
dishonesty. His activities will be injurious to himself and others.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official             He will be assigned to a position of

 Line 5 Prince Chi's light was darkened. Perseverance in
righteous goals advantageous.

Prince Chi was held a prisoner and a slave. He feigned insanity
to avoid being slain, yet inwardly held on firmly to his beliefs.
This is an example for persons born under this line to follow
should they become involved in similar situations. These persons
will work for others throughout their lives, and mainly in condi-
tions where they disagree with the policies and procedures in force.
They must remember that it is not what one does, but rather how
one thinks and feels about one's situation, the way one reacts, and
one's freedom to control one's inner self that are important, not
the fact of being subservient to or dominated by others. External
conditions exist for the lessons one is meant to learn from them,
and for the service one gives by coming to terms with them. There
are many ways to think, and many ways to serve. These persons
have a good number of lessons to learn.
Most auspicious: He will be very knowledgeable, as well as
having the necessary common sense and wisdom to protect

                                                                      271

    have little or no meaning for him.

    changes of job, and lengthy wanderings. His life will be full of
    sorrows and worries.
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official        He should cultivate his own virtue
                                  while keeping clear of troublesome

    Line 6 Dark and gloomy. He climbed once to heaven and then
    feil to earth.

    This depicts a king or ruler who has it within him to become as a
    bright light in heaven, but by having no trust or faith in his sub-
    ordinates and by wounding them at every turn, he meets his fate
    by being deposed. These persons will rise to positions which they
    have either not duly earned, or are not appropriately qualified for.
    They then run into difficulties and find they must start again
    elsewhere. Some will profit early in life from their experiences,
    and will take steps to avoid similar difficulties in the future. Some
    will never learn.
    Most auspicious: He will be wise and far-sighted enough to
    profit from past mistakes and adjust his plans to those which are firm
    and attainable. He will be in a high position, where he can benefit
    others by leading properly and propitiously in times of disaster.
    Least auspicious: He will be a very selfish wastrel, and he will
    use or walk over others in his attempts to progress. In later years
    he will be punished for his earlier mistreatment of others.
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official          He will probably be demoted or dis-
                                    missed.

Hexagram      J7 Chia Jen    ==     The Family (Proper Relations)


SIMPLE      TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
The Family. Advantageous for women to be firm and correct.

COMMENTARY
The trigram Sun, wind, the eldest daughter, is above and leading
Li, fire, the middle daughter. Hence the symbolism that it is
advantageous for women to be firm and correct. The individual
lines depict the family and the proper relations within the family,
e.g., line 1 is the youngest son, while line 6 is the patriarch or
father. Lines 5 and 5 are symbolic of brothers while the relation-
ship between lines 5 and 2 represents the relations between
husband and wife. Lines 2 and 4 (Yin lines) represent women in
the family, properly surrounded and protected by their menfolk
(the Yang lines). Hence the over-all meaning for the hexagram of
5   I The Predictions
the family. Correct family relations are the pillars of Confucian-
ism, especially those depicted above. Quite naturally, too, wind
(Sun) rises from fire (Li), reflecting the inner spirit which should
pervade family relations. For this spirit to continue there must be
substance in which to generate it. This comes from the patriarch,
or superior man, who gives duration to the way in which things
should be done, through the profundity of his words. Persons born
under this hexagram are knowledgeable regarding the customs of
their society, and adhere to them instinctively. The superior ones
try to establish correct relationships in all activities with which
they are associated. They are cautious in their speech, only speak-
ing after due reflection as to the probable consequences of their
words. Their character is stable and resolute, and can be relied on
by others. They act firmly according to the dictates of whatever
circumstances they are in.
   Those born in the sixth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES    (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line 1 Firm       circumscription    within   the   family.   Regrets
vanish.

If everyone's position within the family (or any other grouping)
is firmly and rightly circumscribed, all cause for regrets vanishes.
Everyone then knows his or her responsibility, as well as the
limits within which they have freedom to act. All things are then
carried out properly, arguments are kept to a minimum, and the
feelings of individuals are duly respected. These persons try to
emulate the foregoing principles, wherever they are and at all
levels of activity. It is a pleasure to be associated with such people,
especially because of the harmonious results they attain.
Most auspicious: He will be highly talented in his speciality, and
a man of virtue and integrity. He will analyze all matters deeply
and initiate appropriate actions, whether these be for himself, his
enterprises, his family or his country. He will know how to adapt
to any situation and will invariably have favorable results. He will
also gain wealth and position.
Least auspicious: He will also be a talented person, on a lesser
scale, who is careful and humble. His life will flow smoothly and
he will have considerable affluence. He will be happy and con-
tented.

                             may die.
Line ~ She must not assume separate goals. She must attend to
household duties. Good fortune.

Line z symbolizes the wife. She is admonished not to strive for
independence, but rather to carry out her normal duties in the
society in which she is living. Such behavior reflects a willing-
ness to serve others (a fundamental precept for all mankind) with-
in the limits of her means and to the best of her ability. These
persons will always do the best they can for others, and render the
maximum of service within the limits prescribed for them. They
will constantly be aware of the needs of others and will try to fill
them, as well as carrying out their duties and responsibilities with
a minimum of supervision.
Most auspicious: He will be a person who likes people, to be 'with
them and to help them, and who enjoys notable social relations
with others. He loves well, and will be loved well in return. He
will be prosperous, healthy and happy, with a good family life.
"INomen with this controlling line will make exceptionally good
wives and mothers.
Least auspicious: He will have a good life of service; however he
will achieve only a modest degree of affluence.

   Ordinary people             He may establish or change the
                               location of his household. He will
                               make gains in his enterprises.
Line J Sharpness and severity within the family brings re-
 morse. Good fortune comes from seriousness. If women and
children dally and laugh, misfortune.
5   I   The Predictions
Those who go to either extreme, i.e. being too severe and
domineering on the one hand, or too lax and unconcerned on the
other, are bound to have difficulties. This is too evident to need
further comment. The right course is athoughtfulness that respects
others as individuals of worth and dignity. Seriousness also in-
cludes being kind and forgiving. Persons with this controlling line
may vary widely in the traits they display in their relationships,
within their families and with others.
Most auspicious: He will be thoughtful, serious and humane in
all his relationships. He will be a person of stable character and
personal dignity. He will be an example to others, and a leader
who can regulate major enterprises and maintain order with ease.
He will have a good life in all respects.
Least auspicious: He is likely to be temperamental, with an
easily roused temper. He is also likely to be a vehement iconoclast,
and indulge in carnal pleasures to extremes. He will ruin his
family.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He is likely to be inflexibly bureau-
                               cratic and unforgiving.
   Business and professional He may make a few gains, with
                               difficulty.
   Ordinary people             A year with some sorrow and some
                               joy. He should be careful not to
                               become confused.
Line 4 She enriches the household. Great good fortune.

Line 4 is a Yin line in its right place, and hence the picture of the
wife enriching the household is suggested. This line reflects the
great blessing to any enterprise which the person at one's right
hand can be. By keeping everything in proper order this person
frees the leader for greater undertakings and endeavors, for ex-
pansion, for nobler service, for planning, and for many other
activities, all of which would either be neglected or given minimal
attention if this freedom were not available. This line teaches that
one can be of far-reaching service, no matter what position one is
in, and these persons will be among the noble ones who render
true and lasting service to mankind.
Most auspicious: He will be in a position akin to that of Cabinet
Minister who enriches the country and the people through noble

flourish. He will have a happy and satisfying life, with much
affluence.
Least auspicious: He will have a similar life to the most auspi-
cious, but on a local level.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official       He will receive a rise in position or
                             salary.

                             receive a coveted prize.
   Ordinary people           A good year with substantial
                             profit.
Line 5 The king approaches his family. No need for relief.
Good fortune.

Noble and wise leadership is depicted here. Despite the power and
authority available to this person, he has only good intentions,
directed to improving all relationships in his family and work, so
there is no basis for any fear arising, nor need for any relief from
these conditions to be initiated. Much mutual trust and con-
fidence exists, and is self-sustaining and regenerating, thereby
resulting in much good for, and supporting, all concerned.
Most auspicious: His thoughts, speech and behavior will be a
model for the people. He will love and respect people as indivi-
duals, and will aid them. In return, they will help and support
him. Great harmony will exist, and all will be blessed and will
benefit.
Least auspicious: He will also be wealthy and influential, and
have a harmonious relationship within his family and among his
associates. His life will be beneficial and satisfying.

                                person and will make gains.
Line 6 Sincerity and nobility. Good fortune in the end.

Sagelike, rather than worldly leadership is indicated here. These
r
    3    I   The Predictions
    are men of great inner development, who express themselves
    through the media of art, religion, philosophy and literature.
    The worth of their writings, thoughts and efforts may not
    be recognized at the time they are produced, but they will
    eventually result in lasting benefit. Hence 'good fortune in the
    end.'
    Most auspicious: He will have an advancing and refining in-
    fluence on art and learning. He will be dignified and inspiring;
    and he will have adequate worldly goods to meet his needs, but
    these will not be important to him.
    Least auspicious: He will also be a man of virtue, producing
    benefits throughout a good and influential life.
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official        He will be assigned to a powerful
                                  position.
       Business and professional He will make substantial and bene-
                                  ficial progress.

Hexagram}8       K'uei   ==   Opposition (Estrangement)


SIMPLE   TRANSLATION       OF TEXT
Opposition. Good fortune in limited matters.

COMMENTARY
The trigram Li, fire, over trigram Tui, lake, definitely indicates
opposition, because of their very different natures. They also
represent the second daughter and the youngest daughter living
in the same household. These belong to different husbands so
their tendencies are divergent. The trigrams also stand for
beauty (Li) and joy (Tui). Furthermore, the lake is available for
nourishment, and fire, in addition, means clarity. Those depicted
here have diverse characteristics, some beneficial and some super-
ficial. They are inclined to be dual-natured individuals, presenting
their different personalities in different situations and circum-
stances. They like to be helpful but are inclined to love the lime-
light more. General salesmen, minor diplomats, and some artists
have many of the characteristics of K'uei. Regrettably, they will
have good fortune only if they properly define their lives, limit
themselves to seeking modest and attainable goals, and unify
their divergent interests.
   Those born in the second month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING      LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line I Regrets disappear. When you lose your horses do not
run after them. They will return of their own accord. He remains
free from blame in relations with evil persons.

Some men's mannerisms are naturally soothing and placating,
while others experience difficulties even in minor matters. These
persons are advised never to act in haste. They should be careful
and wait, since the laws of nature have a tendency to equalize
differences without man's interference or wishfulness. Most of
these persons will have great patience, and, in general, will be
aggressive in an unirritating, yet quite competitive way.
Most auspicious: His nobleness and virtue will cause people to
respect him. He will be just, sincere and impartial. His wisdom
will be able to eradicate evil from people's minds. He will not be
3   I The Predictions
successful at an early age, but will attain his goals and have his
desires fulfilled later in life.
Least auspicious: He will face many difficulties, and will find it
hard to establish himself. He will be poor at first, and slowly gain
wealth later in life. He will at first work alone, then later associate
closely with others.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He will gain a good posrnon. If
                                 previously demoted he will be
                                 promoted again.
   Business and professional His efforts, in general, wil, not
                                 receive adequate recognition until
                                 later in the year.
   Ordinary people               Some losses at first, then gains
                                 later.

                                 mony later.
Line 2 He meets his lord in a narrow lane. No error.

Line 2 is the center line of trigram Tui, nourishment, so these
persons quietly and unassumingly render service to others,
avoiding opposition as far as possible. They are blessed with an
intuitive foresight, which aids them in steering a safe course. Since
the two trigrams are in opposition, line 5 cannot straightforwardly
support line 2, hence the picture of an accidental meeting in a
narrow lane. This symbolizes the occasional help these persons
receive from superior persons. These individuals, in general, will
be well versed and effective in whatever they specialize in.
Most auspicious: He will be a loyal statesman, spokesman or
negotiator, or even in the legal profession. He will be a man of
excellent character, correlating and ameliorating the mistakes of
his superiors, as well as improving the morality of the people. He
will have a good and worthwhile life.
Least auspicious: He will also render much service, and com-
municate well with people. He will receive help from friends and
associates. Eventually he will probably lead a secluded life,
 desiring no worldly acclaim. He will have no great ills in his life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will meet a clever superior, and
                                promotion can be expected.

                              vidual who will provide beneficial
                              ideas and support.
   Ordinary people            With the help of a close friend his
                              strong desires will be fulfilled.
Line J His wagon is dragged back. His oxen beaten. His top-
knot (hair) and nose sliced off. Not a good beginning but a good
end.

This man's opposition or estrangement is so intense that the in-
dividual is insulted or treated with disrespect in every possible
way. His progress is impeded and he is dragged back. His oxen
(ideas) are beaten (down), so that further progress will be very
slow. His topknot is cut off. This knot was a symbol of status, so
his pride is injured. Slicing off the nose was a mild form of punish-
ment for robbing or stealing. There will be much adversity in the
lives of these people early on, and they will have many varied
handicaps to overcome. Thus progress will be stunted, but their
calamities and opposition will bring out the best in them and they
will eventually take the challenge, and rise above their initial
conditions. This will be very beneficial for them.
Most auspicious: He will be a smart and intelligent person, but
too much concerned with details and ramifications. He will
examine and criticize everyone and everything too much. Later
in life he will, through self-analysis, realize that his earlier
methods were erroneous and ineffective, and will change.
He will then attain peace, harmony, and the fulfilment of his
desires.
Least auspicious: He will be in a low position of menial labor,
and have many hardships. He will suffer considerably, but his
later life will tend to be smoother and easier.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official            He will meet with misrepresenta-

                                  for an important assignment then
                                  selected later.
   Ordinary people                He will have many hindrances at
                                  first, with an easing off later.
5   I   The Predictions
Line 4    Isolated through estrangement. One meets and grows
with a companion who is compatible and cooperative. The situa-
tion is precarious, but no error.

 Since the two trigrams are in opposition, line 4- and line 1 cannot
get together without a great deal of difficulty. Once they manage
it a very beneficial union ensues. These are analytical persons,
who are very knowledgeable of the laws of nature and up to date
in their profession, and who apply such intelligence very capably.
Their analyses helps them to master any opposition encountered,
and to be both an example to and a nourisher of others. A wise use
of his knowledge will produce success.
Most auspicious: He will be greatly talented and very diplo-
matic. He will receive help when needed from good and bene-
ficial friends. He will be a highly capable administrator, and one
capable of restoring order if necessary. He will meet with ad-
versity early in his career, but later he will have an auspicious
life in all respects.
Least auspicious: He will need to stand alone for much of his
life. He will be honorable in his relations, and modest in his
living. He also will have unfavorable conditions at first, which
then improve later in life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be respected, recommended
                                and supported by colleagues.
   Business and professional He will meet a superior who will
                                exert influence on his behalf.
   Ordinary people              Those seeking marriage will be
                                successful; those in dangerous situa-
                                tions will be saved; those living
                                quiet lives will go on a journey.
                                Those in business will face ad-
                                versities, and then make good
                                gains later in the year.
Line 5 Regrets vanish. The companion bites through the flesh.
Advancing thus, what error can there be?

Whenever these individuals meet with estrangement or opposi-
tion some associate or friend joins them. Troubles disappear and
there is no regret over their not being able to conquer the diffi-
282
                                                3   I   The Predictions
culties independently. This applies to both the physical and meta-
physical realms. Leaders and persons of influence are indicated,
but there are times when they too need help and support. Ad-
vancing in this manner will be beneficial for them.
Most auspicious: He will be a noble person and a man of talent
and virtue, in a high and respected position. His actions and
dealings will be sincere and humble. He will be supported and
helped by wise and able men, and will render support in return.
His attainments will be worthy, and he will have a rich and
rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will receive some help from others, mainly
from members of his family. He will have and enjoy inherited
wealth. In business matters he will find cooperative associates, but
he may have serious disputes with his brothers or sisters.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be promoted.
   Business and professional His writings and other efforts will
                               be quite productive.
   Ordinary people              He will receive help and make
                               profits. If a bachelor, he may
                                marry.
                               If one of the less auspicious, he will
                               have many difficulties.
Line 6 Solitary and estranged. He envisages a boar covered with
mud and a wagon full of fiends. First he draws his bow, then he
lays it aside. They are not bandits but relatives through marriage.
Proceeding forward, rain falls. Good fortune.

The symbolism comes from the characters and position of, and
the effects produced by, lines 6 and 3. At first, line 6 is alone and
against much opposition. He looks at those who should help him
and imagines that they are dirty pigs, or a wagon full of fiends.
He starts on the offensive, but then realizes that they are friends
after all. As the situation clears, just as the air is made clear by a
fall of rain, good fortune results. In general, these persons are too
smart for their own good and for that of others. They see many
things that others do not observe. However, by becoming tolerant
and able to live with limitations, and by giving others due credit,
they can achieve unions, and their work and efforts will then be
productive.
3    I   The Predictions
Most auspicious: He will be intelligent, sagacious and discerning
However, he will be unyielding on many occasions, resulting in
solitude until he changes his ways. He will have hardships early in
life, and then better fortune as he mellows. He may get married
several times.
Least auspicious: He will have much solitude and lonely activity.
He will be quite intractable and will cause many disputes. He will
have an unstable life.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official        Demotion is probable due to mis-
                               representations.
    Business and professional He will have many perplexities at
                               the beginning of the year, but some
                               progress later.
    Ordinary people            He will have losses at first, then
                               small gains. He may be falsely
                               accused.

2.   Intuition and foresight will be very helpful.
3.   Rise to meet challenges.
4.   Choose cooperative companions.

though there may have been previous doubt about them.
6. Through the law of change your opposition is waning. When
this is completed you will have good fortune.

Hexagram)9        Chien    ==   Impediments


SIMPLE     TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
Impediments. The south-west is favorable. The north-east is
hostile. Advantageous to see the great man. Perseverance in the
right brings good fortune.

COMMENTARY
This hexagram is made up of the two trigrams, K' an, water
(chasms), over Ken, mountain. These are both impediments.
They are also the north and north-east trigrams in the Sequence
of Later Heaven, with Li and K'un being in the south and south-
west. Obviously, mountains and chasms are obstacles, whereas
clarity and openness are favorable. The strong line in the fifth
position leading its proper correlate, a weak second line, makes it
advantageous to seek the great man, i.e, a minister from heaven.
Perseverance in what is right will result in good fortune in the
face of impediments. Those who have their controlling line in
one of the first three positions have the potential to be strong,
sturdy and steadfast like a mountain, while those with their con-
trolling line in one of the upper three positions will be more in-
clined to nourish and help others in a step by step manner. All
possess a keen awareness of potential dangers as well as an intui-
tive knowledge of the easier and better courses to follow in any
given situation. They will be found where strength of character
is advantageous, and will be involved with many other persons.
The more auspicious will make good judges and legislators. A
number will be aviators. All will spend much time improving
themselves inwardly.
   Those born in the eighth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING        LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line   I   Advancing leads to difficulties. Quietude brings praise.

Boldly pushing forward against impediments often results in one
encountering many unnecessary obstacles or difficulties. At the
beginning it is best to quietly ponder, and then lay firm, sound
plans which one knows one can carry out. Impetuosity is dan-
gerous. These persons will be planners and administrators, and
blessed with a substantial amount of common sense.
:5   I The Predictions
Most auspicious: He will be greatly talented and will achieve a
worthy and well-earned reputation. He will know how to stop in
the face of impending dangers, and how to surmount or circum-
vent them. He will have a slow and difficult start in his career,
but will have a favorable life later.
Least auspicious: He will be reasonably energetic, but un-
ambitious. He will keep clear of difficulties by not charging
into them, and will be content to lead a simple and virtuous
life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         Earned praise can be expected.
   Business and professional Hold back from engaging in major
                               projects.
   Ordinary people             Be conservative, and stick to proven
                               methods.
Line 2 The king's administrator meets with impediment upon
impediment. This is not his fault.

Line 5 represents the king. Line 2 is the proper correlate of line 5,
and represents the king's public administrator, who here runs into
a great many difficulties. These are due to the situation he is in
rather than being self-generated, hence he is not held at fault.
Stable and strong persons, who work for the ruler or leader in
difficult situations, are indicated. They are able and effective
administrators and are supported by their superior or leader.
Their work will constantly involve dealing with troublesome
matters, both in quantity and quality, but they will be equal to
whatever task faces them. Naturally some will be more successful
than others.
Most auspicious: lIe will be patriotic, loyal to his superiors and
to his parents, and a noble father to his family. Whatever he does
will be well planned and his results will be effective. This applies
in both his personal and professional life.
Least auspicious: He will be honest, loyal and sincere, with his
family and in his enterprises. Father and son will cooperate in
meeting difficulties. Wife will work with husband, but they will
not be socially minded. He will be respected in his community.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Patriotism and loyalty will be dis-
                                played with effective results.

      Business and professional It is not propitious to try to advance
                               this year.
       Ordinary people          He can expect adversity at first,
                                with things smoothing out later.
                               The less auspicious may die.
    Line J Advancing leads to troubles, so he stops and returns.

    At the top of the mountain, the third line of the trigram Ken, one



I
    is overawed by what one sees. This man does not have the where-
    withal to proceed alone (line 6 does not support line 5 here). He is
    sufficiently wise to be aware of his real situation at all times, and
    so forgoes dangerous advances, returning instead to his family and
    friends, where he finds mutual trust, comfort and support.
    Most auspicious: He will know the right time to act, and how to
    get help and support from his friends, peers, and people in general.
    He may be assigned to a government position, and his life will be
    peaceful and comfortable.
    Least auspicious: He will be in local government or in a business
    position, where he will assist in making changes and improve-
    ments. He will follow accepted mores. Also, he will receive help
    from his wife or her family.
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official         He will be transferred to the seat of
                                   government, and promoted.
        Business and professional Being more competitive will pro-
                                    duce favorable results.

                                   Those less auspicious may beinjured.
     Line 4 Advancing leads to troubles. Returning brings union.

    Line 4 is at the brink of the chasm, and thus serious impediments
    are faced. Since this is the position of the minister it is right for
    this man to pause and unite the divergent elements in every situa-
    tion so that a successful advance can be made when the time is
    propitious. These persons will become factory managers, union
    organizers, psychologists, and in all similar activities where
    coordination of divergent activities or ideas is involved.
    Most auspicious: He will associate with leaders and intellectuals
    and he himself will be well versed in their concerns. His know-
    ledge and character will naturally attract others to him, and he
                                                                        287

substantial inheritance, and will have a good family, with several
children.

and will receive help from others.

                                 profit will be successful.
   Ordinary people               The more auspicious will make
                                 gains. The less auspicious will have
                                 many disputes.
Line 5 In the midst of great impediments, friends come.

This line is the ruler, and is proper in all respects. It is, however,
in the chasm, so this man faces impediments, but by virtue of the
line's correctness, friends come and he receives all the help and
support he needs to overcome or circumvent the impediments,
and achieve his aims.
Most auspicious: He will be a wise, able and respected leader or
manager, who follows the golden mean, and carries out what is
right and just at all times. He is trusted and respected by his
juniors and seniors alike, and will always receive whatever support
he needs. He will contribute to the welfare of the world, his
country, and his community. He will have a good and rewarding
life.
Least auspicious: He will come from a poor family, but because
he always does things correctly and has a good character, he will
be helped by others, and will gradually improve and increase his
status, influence and affluence.
In yearly hexagram:
   For everyone                 It will be an auspIcIOUSyear. He
                                will be supported by good people,
                                and will achieve his goals and a
                                profit.
Line 6 Advancing leads to impediments. Remaining brings
great good fortune. It is advantageous to see the great man.

The top line has gone as far as it can. These persons have learned

                                               3 / The Predictions
how to overcome impediments, so proceeding further would not
be beneficial. Instead, it brings great blessings to them if they
stay where they are in life, and support, help and bring along
those under them. Seeing the great man here means turning in-
ward to find the guidance and inspiration for the actions they
should take in their magnanimity. They will be great teachers
and leaders, whether in the employ of others or acting indepen-
dently.
Most auspicious: He will be greatly talented, and a man of
strong virtue, who works unselfishly to serve his ruler and the
people, directly or indirectly. His efforts will be effective and he
will establish great merit. He will have a favorable reputation
and will probably become famous. He will exert much influence,
and will have a good family and personal life.
Least auspicious: He will also lead a good and influential life at
a fairly high level. He will receive much support from others.

    Hexagram 40        Hsieh    =.:: Deliverance   (Release, Clarification)


    SIMPLE      TRANSLATION        OF TEXT
    Deliverance. The south-west is favorable. When going forward is
    not productive, going back brings good fortune. When going
    forward is a necessity, early action will bring good fortune.

    COMMENTARY
    This hexagram is made up of the trigrams Chen, thunder, over
    K'an, rain. The name Hsieh implies untying something difficult.
    The air is always clear and smells fresh again after thunder and
    rain, hence the names Deliverance, Release, and Clarification.
    K'an includes step by step progress, and Chen signifies the re-
    newal of life in the springtime. Thus these persons will be
    inwardly tenacious, persevering, progressive, purposeful and reso-
    lute individuals. They will take their time reaching decisions,
    but once their mind is made up they will do everything possible
    to achieve their goals expeditiously. Some may be criticized for
    being too laborious, but on the whole most will be noble, under-
    standing and considerate, forgiving freely, and being lenient yet
    just regarding crimes and wrongdoings. The south-west is sym-
    bolic of where the people are to be found, so these persons should
    work in public or concern themselves with public matters.
       Those born in the twelfth month will be more auspicious.

    CONTROLLING         LINES    (FROM   BOTTOM     TO TOP)
    Line    I   No error.

    These persons possessthe basic traits described in the commentary
    above, but since this is the first line of the hexagram they are not
    as strong nor as deeply ingrained as they could be. In general, the
    actions of these persons will be innocent rather than conniving
    or devious, and their lives vvill tend to be free from major error,
    especially in the area of their character development.

Most auspicious: He will have a well-balanced character, com-
bining toughness with gentleness in his leadership and in the
division of family duties and responsibilities. He will know the
right times to use severity or gentleness, and his leadership will
produce lasting benefits. He will be free from serious troubles and
will have an auspicious life.
Least auspicious: He will also be persistent, stable and calm,
acting correctly and leading in the right manner. Others will
readily cooperate with him, and he will have a good life.

   Ordinary people             If a bachelor, he may get married,
                              and it will be an auspicious event.
                              Business enterprises will flourish.
Line 2 He slays three foxes in the field and receives a golden
arrow. Righteousness will bring good fortune.

The 'three foxes' are, according to ancient symbolism, greed,
ignorance and fear. And a golden arrow was a highly prized
award received only when something truly great had been done.
Persons capable of eliminating these three 'foxes' within them-
selves, and in others, are exceptional. If they succeed, they
definitely merit a substantial reward. These individuals will have
inherent leadership qualities, and their lives will be favored, by
the localities in which they live and the education that they re-
ceive. They will develop into moral and spiritual leaders (some
may even become religious leaders) wherever they are and ir-
respective of their worldly careers,
Most auspicious: He will follow the golden mean and will be a
just and impartial person. He will have good morals, personal
integrity, and a favorable reputation. He will be able to inspire
others, promote good, and expel evil. His life will be beneficial
and favorable on many levels.
Least auspicious: He will also associate with, and help, good
people. He will have wise persons as close friends, and he will
avoid evil. He will always have ample wealth and, may get married
two or more times.

Line}    Luggage bearers ride in the carriage. This attracts
robbers. Continuing in such a way leads to blame.

This line shows that pretending to be something that one is not
leads to dangers and difficulties. On the other hand, it is auspicious
for those for whom pretense is a requirement, such as actors and
actresses, or those connected with advertising and careers of a
similar nature. Regrettably this trait will have a tendency to
enter into their private lives, and this can result in difficulties.
Most auspicious: He may rise to a high position and income, in a
well chosen and appropriate field, but it will have much artifici-
ality associated with it.
Least auspicious: He will tend to be cunning, vicious, mean,
corrupt, ugly and unsociable. His life will be one of hardships.
In yearly hexagram:

Line 4 Emancipate yourself from your big toe. A friend then
comes. Put your trust in him.

Some inferior internal elements, or some external weaknesses (in
associates, career, position, ideas or situation) are impeding rapid
progress, as would happen with an individual suffering from an
ailing big toe. Advancements can be made, but they will not be
easy or without suffering until the big toe is well. But, since like
attracts like, a friend will come, in whom you can and should put

to them. Their degree of success will depend on correct self-
analysis, and on the extent to which they are willing to be of
service to others (the fourth line is the position of the minister).
Most auspicious: He will find the right path early in life, and will
then have a good career, with many friends and associates. He will
eventually rise to a position of influence and affluence.
Least auspicious: He will not find the right path, and will fumble
and stumble through life. His talents, efforts and perseverance
will be minimal, resulting in a poor life.

                                conniving people.
Line 5 The superior man achieves release. Good fortune ensues.
He receives the confidence if inferior persons.

No human being is perfect, but these individuals develop them-
selves to such an extent that inferior elements are automatically
repelled, and good fortune consequently results for these superior
persons. Their greatness brings respect and confidence, without
any jealousy, even from inferiors, whatever their position. The
function of those born under this line demands great self-sacrifice
and only a few people can attain such a high degree of evolution.
The potential for doing so, of course, exists in others as well.
Most auspicious: He will be a sage and sagacious person, with a
keen insight into, and understanding of, human nature. He will
correct evil and evil persons, and will help all people. He will
select individuals wisely when meeting needs, and will be in an
influential position benefiting many people.
Least auspicious: He will also attract people through his sin-
cerity and honesty, and will have a favorable and locally in-
 fluential life.

Line 6 The prince shot an arrow and killed a hawk on a high
wall. Everything is favorable.

The highest degree of effecting deliverance or release is depicted
here. The prince is a truly noble person. The hawk is symbolic of
evil or inferior elements, which the prince eliminates with the
proper weapon, i.e, an arrow. These are, or will be, persons who
are highly developed, and who will leave the normal mundane
manner of existence behind them and devote themselves to
higher causes and spiritual matters. They are to be found in
several different spheres of activity, and will usually be quite
successful.
Most auspicious: He will be greatly talented, and enthusiastic
in his efforts to achieve results. He will be a man of influence
and favorable reputation, courageous, brave and effective, with
sword, tongue or pen. He will make great contributions to his
country and to the world, as well as having a good personal life,
especially with his family.

individual, highly respected, and with a favorable life, in a
modest way.

COMMENTARY
'When a mountain (Ken) sits over a lake (Tui) part of the lake is
absorbed into the mountain, and part of the mountain is im-
mersed in the lake, so there is a decrease in each. These are persons
who present a stern, strong front, who need to soften their natures
and traits inwardly for maximum effectiveness. Some will be
stubborn, fixed, and set in their ways. Others will have different
faults which need to be decreased. The lower trigram is a lake,
which indicates that they have the potential to nourish others.
These people will develop this potential more and more as they
sincerely rid themselves of harmful attributes, especially anger
and irritability, and increasingly adopt more beneficial character-
istics. They should be particularly wary of their tendency to try
and live in the past. Being humble, reverent, and thankful for
 all the blessings bestowed by the Creator will be helpful, both to
these persons and to those whom they are helping.
    Those born in the seventh month will be more auspicious.

5   I   The Predictions
Normally it is the best policy to move on quickly without fuss to a
                                                                            I
new task when the previous one is completed. The world, how-
ever, is based on people helping and supporting each other,
directly or indirectly. So, when this person's task is finished he
should help any others who need it. He is cautioned that being
too helpful and doing too much for others may be just as harmful
as not doing enough. He must give help only after due thought,
and only to the extent that it does not place the other under an
oppressive obligation. These persons will continually help them-
selves and then help others, no matter what position they may hold.
Most auspicious: He will be in a high position, serving his ruler
or leader unselfishly. He will adapt quickly to changing circum-
stances and handle matters in such a way as to bring praise. He
will discern the true needs of others and will assist them judi-
ciously when necessary. He will become wealthy and famous.
Least auspicious: He will be a man of virtue, but lacking in
common sense, so that he neither helps himself nor others advan-
tageously; therefore he will have a hard life and will be very busy.
Unfortunately he will remain poor.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will place duty ahead of his

                                an award or distinction are very

   Ordinary people              A good year for gains and profit.
Line 2 Maintain correctness. Undertakings bring misfortune.
He increases others without decreasing himself.

All life is a matter of service in one form or another, and there are
an almost limitless number of ways one can serve. Those depicted
here will fare best if they pursue only established ways, and do
not try to take that one extra step into the unknown. Also, the
more service they render to others, the greater their own ad-
vantage. Hence, 'he increases others without decreasing himself.'
The gifts of the universe are unlimited, and the more one gives
the more one receives. The basic principle here is to find needs and
then fill them, within due limits and in accordance with existing
mores.
                                               3 / The Predictions
Most auspicious: He will be upright in character and diligent in
the pursuit of benevolence. He will continuously make beneficial
contributions to his country, his work and his family, as well
as uplifting many others. He will have a rich and rewarding
life.
Least auspicious: He also will be largely unselfish. He will make
conscientious efforts to be of service to others, and will have ample
means for a modest life.

L~'ne} When three people set forth together, their number
decreases by one. When one sets forth alone, he finds a com-
panion.

This reflects a balanced pattern in keeping with the balance
between Yin and Yang. These persons will be good arbiters and
administrators, who equalize matters for the maximum benefit
of all concerned. Their private lives will be as well balanced as
their professional lives. This holds true in all spheres, mental,
physical and spiritual.
Most auspicious: He will have excellent associates, with whose
cooperation much can be achieved. He will be virtuous, judicious
and benevolent. His deeds and accomplishments will merit praise,
and will have the approval of both his juniors and his seniors. He
will have a good life.
Least auspicious: He will also be successful in cooperation and
social activity, with his desires and actions readily accepted by
others. He will have an easy life, with ample material possessions.

                            bachelor, he may marry.
Line 4 He reduces the troubles besetting him. Others then come
and are glad to help him. No error.

To correct external conditions one must first correct oneself in-
wardly. To reduce one's troubles one must first overcome one's
faults. When this is done others (under the aegis of line 1) are
glad to come and help. This brings happiness and freedom from
error. These persons will be in positions where they can render
service to others, and will have the intuitive understanding that
by constantly improving themselves they will gradually become
of greater benefit to themselves and to others. This will bring
happiness to all those concerned. Some will make much more
rapid progress than others.
Most auspicious: He will forge ahead and try to do what is
right at all times. He will gladly correct his own faults, and
judiciously point out faults in others. He will attain much know-
ledge and experience which he will use to advantage by establish-
ing something truly worthwhile. He will be favored.
Least auspicious: He also will correct his own faults rapidly.
He will have many hardships during his early years and in middle
age. His senior years will be easier and more effective.

                                have a joyous year. Those who
                                have been inactive will be active.
                                All will experience some unusual
                               joy. All will make gains.
 Line 5 One is enriched by ten pairs of tortoise shells. It cannot
be opposed. Great good fortune.

The changing of this line into a Yang results in hexagram 61,
Chung Fu, Inner Truth. When inner truth is great, no external
force can prevent good fortune from materializing. It is like
receiving the good fortune of ten pairs of tortoise shells (tortoise

shells were used for divination in ancient times) all giving auspi-
cious omens. Thus, when one truly decreases one's faults nothing
can prevent one's good fortune. These people are leaders and
managers who have learned a lesson similar to that expressed by
Napoleon when he said, 'If I could keep my anger beneath my
chin I could rule the world.' These persons achieve great control
over other faults as well, and are examples for others to emulate.
Most auspicious: He will be a strong, open-minded administra-
tor for, and supporter of, the leader in his enterprise. He will be
in a high position, and helped by wise and able associates. He will
be respected by his juniors and seniors alike, and will attain wealth
and fame.
Least auspicious: He will be respected and well known locally.
He will have a favorable life and a good family.

Line 6 He increases others without depriving himself. No error.
Right actions will produce good fortune. Firm goals advantageous.
He obtains followers but no longer has a home.

Unselfish devotion to duty for the benefit of others results in
directly helping others, and indirectly helping oneself as well.
Naturally this is not erroneous. Furthermore, the more correct
one's actions are, the better the good fortune produced. Since this
man has firm goals he will attract followers. The demand for his
services will be so great that he will have to sacrifice his home life
to devote his energies to the public good. Men of great strength of
character, coupled with deep wisdom and able leadership, will be
the most successful.
Most auspicious: He will establish universal goals for himself,
designed to benefit the masses, and will work unselfishly to
achieve these goals. Indirectly he will attract wealth and satisfac-
tion for himself. What he establishes will be lasting and worth-
while.
                                                                    -zg9

moderately successful in most of his activities. He may even be-

COMMENTARY
The Image associated with this hexagram symbolizes increase. It
advises the superior man when he sees good to imitate it, and
when he sees faults to correct them. The action of the wind
driving clouds together, producing thunder and rain, clears the
air and nourishes others. That is the action of the two trigrams in
this hexagram. Hence, this is a time for rendering service to
others. Through service one gains control of one's life, which
increases others and oneself as well. These persons will be men of
vision, with beneficial ideas. They will be wise and energetic, and
have a strong liking for people as well as a pleasing personality.
Their worth will become obvious to others early in their lives,
and the more auspicious will rise quickly in their careers. They
will never stop learning, nor will they ever cease rendering
service.
   Those born in the seventh month will be the most auspicious.
Those born between the second and eighth months will be more
auspicious than those born from the ninth to the first month, in-
clusive.

CONTROLLING        LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line [   It is advantageous to undertake great deeds. Sublime
good fortune. No blame.

This line is the ruling line of the trigram Chen, arousing, and,
since it is in the right place, it is a time for deeds of great quality.
There is no blame, whether they be great or small in scope. The
important thing is that they should be noble of purpose. These
individuals will have a strong vitality, imagination and enthusi-
asm. They will analyze their possible actions thoroughly in ad-
vance, formulate feasible plans, and then execute them precisely.
Rarely, if ever, will they do anything on the spur of the moment
without a purpose.
Most auspicious: He will become capable of undertaking great
works, of a nature that will establish long term benefits, and be
considered meritable. He will intuitively know and support those
things which are durable or worthy of duration. He will serve the
Creator, his country, his family and his work well, and will have
an auspicious life.
sI   The Predictions
Least auspicious: He will be a man of worthwhile character and
much ability. He will not be over ambitious, and not inclined to
undertake deeds of great magnitude, but he will manage his
household affairs ably and successfully,
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        Promotion is probable.
   Business and professional Advancements are favored.
   Ordinary people            Strong desires will be fulfilled.
Line 2 One is enriched by ten pairs of tortoise shells. It cannot
be opposed. Righteous persistence brings good fortune. The
Creator is served by the king. Supreme good fortune.

As with line 5 of Hexagram 41, through change in this line the
hexagram turns into Hexagram 61, Chung Fu, or inner truth,
from which all external conditions stem. The force of inner truth
cannot be opposed. Here, too, this person is primarily in a support-
ing role, in keeping with the general character of the hexagram,
i.e., being of service to others. He who renders service here is
commended by the king to the Creator during worship and
sacrifice. In ancient times this was a very great honor, since it
implied being included in the king's own family. The result of
mutual support and service from persons so ably qualified, and in
their proper positions, is truly great good fortune for the king, the
masses, and for the individuals themselves. The maxim to be
drawn from all this is that to serve is to rule.
Most auspicious: He will be a well-qualified person of noble
character, possessing noteworthy traits, and a strong inner desire
to render service. He will be humble and open-minded, associat-
ing with good friends in proper places. He will be in a high
position, respected by those in authority, by his peers and by the
people. He will have a long, favorable and prosperous life.
Least auspicious: He also will be of noble character, but not too
intelligent nor too ambitious. He will have a modest life, with
 ample wealth. His few accomplishments will be beneficial ones.
 In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official          Promotion may be anticipated.
    Business and professional His efforts will favorably enhance
                                 his reputation.
    Ordinary people              He will gain profits, and his prop-

Line}    He gains through unfortunate circumstances not of his
own making. Walking in the middle he announces himself to his
prince by the emblem of his office.

Here at the top of the trigram Chen, arousing, one is very ambi-
tious but one's position (line 3) is precarious and insecure. Divine
manifestations are not always in keeping with man's ideas. These
persons will be able and sincere, devoted in their efforts to be of
service to their leaders and their country, but they will often find
themselves in difficult situations. In many dire circumstances
there will be an unexpected turn of events which will be en-
riching and rewarding. Such matters are controlled by the
Creator, who knows far better than man what should truly be
and why. These persons do not seek fame or glory for themselves,
yet will find themselves well known and sought after, as a result of
their ever increasing reputation. Any hardships and worries are due
to their karma, which they are in process of coming to terms with.
Most auspicious: He will be loyal, upright and diligent in his
service to his leader, and will serve equally well in times of peace
or war. He will be dynamic and courageous, and will seek op-
portunities to be of ever greater service to his country, his work,
and his family. He will establish himself in a high position,
socially, professionally and financially.
Least auspicious: He will have considerable knowledge and
much common sense, and will know how to deal with almost any
situation that is not too difficult. He will be trusted and respected,
 and his senior years will be very favorable.

Most auspicious: He will be in a high position in the govern-
ment, working for the ruler. His efforts will be fair and just, for

questions. Supreme good fortune. Your unswerving virtue will be
 recognized.

The highest degree of rendering service to increase others is
depicted here. It stems from a deep inner desire so strong that it
moves everything externally in the desired direction. One's
actions are right and just, and consequently these persons have
no need to ask the oracle for advice or guidance. The right answers
are already there inside, merely waiting for the opportunity to be
made manifest. These individuals will be a blessing and benefit
wherever they are.
Most auspicious: His talents and abilities will be great enough
to control his country if necessary. He will love people and will do
his best for them. They, in turn, will respect him. He will
achieve well-deserved fame and wealth.
Least auspicious: He will also have a great love for people and
will want to do the best he can for them, but in a quieter and
more private way than the most auspicious. He may control an
enterprise of benefit to others, or be a minister or a monk.

     Officer or official      He will be assigned to the support
                              of a high official.
   Business and professional His efforts at advancement will
                              bring beneficial gains.
   Ordinary people            Strong desires will be fulfilled. He
                              will associate with several good
                              friends.
Line 6 He who does not strive to increase others will be
attacked. Inconsistency of heart brings misfortune.

Moral, physical, intellectual and spiritual atrophy are depicted
here. These are persons who have talents and knowledge but fail
to use them. The result is a retrogression leading to misfortune.
One should strive to the best of one's ability to keep one's talents
active through use, and especially through service to others.
Neglect is a waste and a failure to carry out a part of one's
responsibility to one's fellow men. Lack of ambition, laziness,
selfishness, egoism, and a generally negative attitude are indicated.
Most auspicious: He will be grasping, and covetous of fame and
profits. He will tend to use others callously, and walk over those
in his path in order to attain his desires. He may obtain consider-
able wealth, but there will be neither happiness nor friendship
associated with it.
Least auspicious: He will be a vicious, treacherous, lecherous
and evil person, hurting all with whom he comes in contact. He
will have a harmful life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be blamed for greed.
   Business and professional He will be blamed for over extend-
                                ing his enterprise.
   Ordinary people              He will have difficulties due to
                                greediness, and he may even get
                                seriously hurt.

Hexagram 4J          Kuai    =.=    Resoluteness (Removal)


SIMPLE        TRANSLATION         OF TEXT
Resoluteness. One must make the matter known truthfully in
court. Also one must announce it in one's own city to avert a
resort to arms. Advancing is advantageous.

COMMENTARY
The last weakness or evil (that you possess) must be removed
(from the top of the hexagram) in order that the perfection of the
Creative may be achieved. This must be done with determination,
openly and in public. There is always the danger of evil trying to
fight its way back to regain its former place. Hence not only is an
open confession required, but one's inner self must know and
accept the change, and carry it through in a peaceful manner.
Fighting will give the evil strength. Advancing, and removing
the weeds one by one, in a just way, will be advantageous. The
trigram Tui, lake, is above Ch'ien, heaven. Heaven indicates
heavenly nourishment, i.e. the improvement of morals and
character in some, and the enhancement of spiritual development
in others. These individuals have the potential to be superior
persons, able to help other individuals to improve themselves.
They will be found in all walks of life and at various levels, al-
ways at the stations where destiny decrees they can serve the
divine purpose best. Their inner strength and ability is great if

they choose to use it. Through use it will grow and thus be of
ever greater value.
   Those born in the third month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line I Power in the toes. Advance. No success. He is blame-
worthy.

This line, in the bottom position, does not have sufficient strength
to advance and attain success by itself. Hence, any boastfulness or
show of power is erroneous since this will not accomplish results.
If one acts thus, one truly deserves blame. Primarily, it indicates
that those with this controlling line should be cautious in their
lives, and only try to advance at any given time as far as they
know they can safely go, yet they should always strive for ad-
vance. All will have great inner strength, but some will use it for
purposes of good and some will not.
Most auspicious: He will know when, in which direction, and
how far to advance. He will be wise, and capable of avoiding
danger. He will be wise inwardly; his external circumstances will
be such, however, that he will not be able to use all his knowledge
effectively. He will have a good life.
Least auspicious: He will be a man of no virtue, who will use
his powers for gain and self-satisfaction. He will be boastful and
will exaggerate. He will always try to be the leader, but will lack
the basic intelligence to carry matters through effectively. He
will have many hardships, and may bring disaster upon himself
and his associates.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be blamed for a rash de-
                               cision.
   Business and professional Efforts to advance will be repelled
                               by others.
   Ordinary people             He will make many mistakes, due
                               to rashness and impetuosity.
Line 2 Cries of alarm at night. He who is prepared (armed) need
have no fear.

He who is alert and prepared can cope with any situation. These
persons are strong, energetic and diligent in their efforts, and in

     correcting and improving. They have the innate intelligence to
     know what needs to be done, and how to do it. They then have the
     necessary strength of character, and a sufficiently propitious
     personality, to carry it through to completion. They also know
     how to protect themselves against even the most artful people.
     Most auspicious: He will be wise and thoughtful. He will take
     logical precautions against calamities, and will help save the
     nation from imminent dangers. He will follow the golden mean;
     people will readily submit to him; and he will achieve fame in
     literary and/or military matters.
     Least auspicious: He will also be good at planning and in
     strategic matters. He will like to be active. Sometimes he will
     have joy, and sometimes sorrow. He may establish merit and
     gain a favorable reputation in the government or military, but
     not to such a high degree as the more auspicious.
     In yearly hexagram:
         Officer or official        He will be assigned to a position of
                                    great authority.
        Business and professional He will make gains through written
                                    or literary efforts.
        Ordinary people             He will probably suffer from
                                    worries, shocks, attempted bur-

     The superior man is firmly resolved. Walks alone. Encounters
     rain. Gets bespattered by mud. The people speak against him. No
     blame.

     These persons are quite strong and intelligent, but unfortunately
     over eager. They like to talk, but if their efforts are primarily talk
     with nothing concrete behind it, or if they are injudicious and in-
     advertently make their plans known in advance to the wrong
     persons, then misfortune will result. Their eagerness will make
     them hasty, and, in general, they will not be able to wait for, or
     cooperate with, slower thinking and acting people. So they will
     set forth to attain their goals on their own. The rain symbolizes
     that they will tend to achieve their purpose, but if they are
     muddied on the way people will think adversely of them. Since
     their purposes, in general, are correct, they should not be blamed
     even if they go about trying to attain their goals in the wrong way.

Most auspicious: He will be greatly talented and knowledgeable,
and possess toughness and fortitude. He will thoroughly think
matters through before acting. He will be able to destroy separa-
tist cliques and help remove the troubles of the country, for the
benefit of the government and the people. He will achieve great
merit.
Least auspicious: He will be smart yet hawkish, liking to fight,
and generally troublesome. He will enjoy solitude, and will have
few friends. He will be very critical and will w,orry frequently.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will try to remove evil persons,
                                but will probably fail and be pun-
                                ished by the evil person's followers.
    Business and professional He will tend to be critical and
                                complain that the world does not
                                recognize him appropriately.
    Ordinary people             If he follows the right path, a
                                generally favorable year. If one of
                                the less auspicious, he will have
                                hardships, and encounter much
                                evil.
Line 4 There is no skin on his haunches and he walks with
difficulty. If he allowed himself to be led like a sheep, occasion for
remorse would disappear. Even hearing these words he will not
believe them.

Normally the fourth line depicts the munster and the actions
appropriate for him. In this case it speaks of an intelligent culprit
who has been punished for not listening or not following the ad-
vice given him. If he would accept the suggestions made, as a
sheep will allow itself to be led, then his troubles and irate feelings
would disappear. But he will tend to remain stubborn and not
listen to this advice either, but follow his own way, adamantly
and defensively. However, if he is wise, as a minister should
be, he will use this advice as a guide for removing mean people
and evil influences. Some will take this action and some will
not.
Most auspicious: He will be a knowledgeable and experienced
man of virtue, working for the maximum good. He will work un-
obtrusively, and will readily accept valuable advice from others.

                                                                     309
3   I   The Predictions
In general, he will make correct decisions and do what is right,
and thereby attain fame.
Least auspicious: He will hold to wrong beliefs obstinately, and
his plans will fail. He may become crippled or deaf. He may
become a cowboy, a shepherd or a zoo-keeper.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official       He will have difficulties due to
                             being considered inadequately quali-
                             fied for his assignment.
   Business and professional Proposals of a new type will fail.
   Ordinary people           He will have disputes, be punished,
                             or have ear or foot trouble.
Line 5 In eliminating undesired vegetation, firm action IS
necessary. Following the middle course leads to no blame.

The elimination of persistent and insidious evil is depicted here.
In the USA the analogy would be to the difficulty in removing
crab grass, which establishes roots wherever its tentacles touch
the ground, as well as having long and hidden roots in all direc-
tions underground. These persons will be leaders, but in difficult
and dangerous positions. They must be indomitable in spirit and
strong of purpose. They must analyze each situation correctly,
and then unrelentingly and persistently pursue the best action
possible. If they can do this, following a middle course will help,
and not be wrong. The task is great.
Most auspicious: He will be intelligent, perspicacious and quick-
witted. He will follow the golden mean, and will correct many
evils for the benefit of his country. He will improve the morality
of the people, and will curb evil, and evil persons. He will have a
rich and rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will be cowardly and lackadaisical, and
will shrink from taking necessary correcti ve actions. He will lack
determination but will try to compensate by being stubbornly
biased. He will not be easily accessible; he will be unpredictable,
subject to flattery and favors, and will have many difficulties and
serious troubles in his life.

                                ruption.

     Ordinary people           Strong wishes will be fulfilled. He
                               will win lawsuits; his health will be
                               good.
Line 6     No support. In the end, misfortune.

Line 6 receives no support, either from line 3 or line 5, so this
man is alone. He has arrived at a high place through his own hard
effort, and feels himself superior to others, not hesitating to show
it in many ways. This becomes damaging to his long term develop-
ment.
Most auspicious: He will attain wealth and status, but will de-
velop arrogance with it. He will tend to abuse his power by taking
advantage of others and harming those with lesser power. He will
receive constant sniping at his wealth, and will not find happiness.
Least auspicious: He will be extremely jealous, with an acrid
disposition. He will have few friends, if any. Misfortunes of one
sort or another will be associated with all his efforts.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official         Find a way to retreat gracefully

                                professionally.
    Ordinary people             Plans will not materialize readily;
                                stick to proven methods. There will
                                be difficulties in the family. An
                                older person may die.

      Hexagram       44   Kou   ==   Contact (Relationships)


      SIMPLE       TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
      Contact. The maiden is bold and powerful. One should not marry
      her.

      COMMENTARY
      A double symbolism is contained in this hexagram. The first is
      given by the Yin line, which is bold and powerful, and has
      entered at the bottom of the otherwise all Yang hexagram. Such
      a maiden, consorting with five men, is not the type one should
      marry. The other symbolism is given by the trigram Sun, wind,
      below trigram Ch'ien, heaven. Heavenly matters are thus made
      known and their influence is felt everywhere. Conversely, what-
      ever things are happening on earth will be known by those above.
      The controlling lines determine the nature of the meetings and
      relationships, for all those affected by them. In the adverse lines,
      inferior individuals are trying to rise primarily, while in the
      auspicious lines great personages are exercising commendable
      leadership.
         Those born in the fifth month will be more auspicious.

good fortune. The evil or inferior man, given an inch will take an
ell, and will be obstreperous like a lean pig. If permitted, his
actions will not be in keeping with the customs, and he will go
around fighting and scraping for advantages or gain. Strong
persons must be in control.
Most auspicious: He will try to do what is right but will have
insufficient talent and strength to accomplish anything truly great.
However, he will provide for himself and his family adequately.
Least auspicious: He will possess very little talent or experience,
and limited abilities. He will tend to act rashly or recklessly in his
efforts to succeed, but this will only produce more difficulties.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He may be demoted.
   Business and professional He will have grave concern about
                                maintaining his position.
   Ordinary people               He will meet a noble person whom
                                he can trust, and who will help him
                                 make gains. Women will probably
                                bear a child. The least auspicious
                                 may become seriously ill or have
                                 disputes.
 Line 2 There is a hamper of fish. No error. No advantage to the
guests.

The 'hamper of fish' represents line 1, which this line, being im-
mediately above it and one of the rulers of the hexagram, has to
hold in check and repel so that it does not mingle with 'the
guests,' the remaining four lines above. Individuals of strong
character, capable of controlling difficult situations, are depicted
here. These persons can be found in nearly all walks of life, and
they will be protectors of good government and good ethics.
Most auspicious: He will be greatly talented, experienced,
open-minded, open-hearted and benign, with a deep love of
people and a willingness to cooperate. He will automatically
attract people and be helped by them, and he will have a favorable
life.
Least auspicious: He will become a rich person by the wrong
means, and will be niggardly, miserly, narrow-minded and obsti-
nate. He will not like people, and will try to make gains at the
expense of others. He will not have an enjoyable life.

        5   I   The Predictions
        In yearly hexagram:
            Officer or official        He will be promoted.
            Business and professional  He will have a chance to be selected
                                       for a favorable position.
           Ordinary people             He will gain profits, and his personal
                                       property may increase. Women are
                                       likely to become pregnant.
        Line J There is no skin on his haunches and he walks with
        difficulty. The position is dangerous. No great error.

        This image refers to what would happen if this line (the third line
        is normally unfavorable, as it is here) were to try to meet half
        way, and have a relationship with, line 1. Line 3 does not here
        receive help from line 6, which normally does assist it, so the
        position of this man is dangerous. Since he decides to strive up-
        wards he will fare reasonably well and make no great mistakes,
        even though, for the most part, he must work alone. This will
        develop a toughness of character which will be both a blessing,
        keeping him on the right path, and a handicap when dealing with
        others.
        Most auspicious: He will not be sufficiently skilled or gifted to
        accomplish anything truly great, but he will attain enough
        affluence to keep his household and have a good family life. His
        later years will be more fruitful than his earlier life.
        Least auspicious: He will work and strive in solitude, and re-
        ceive no assistance. He will face many hardships, including ill-
        nesses. His feet may give particular trouble.
        In yearly hexagram:
           Officer or official         He will be reprimanded or demoted.
           Business and professional His progress will seem impeded in
                                       every direction.
           Ordinary people             He will have troubles, and probable
                                       business losses.
        Line 4 N? fish in the hamper. Misfortune imminent.

        The 'hamper of fish' is line 1, which correlates with line 2 and
        hence is not available to this line, its normal partner, thus 'no
        fish.' The world is designed on a basis of interdependence, mutual
        support and service, so if one remains alone, as line 4 does here,
        misfortune will eventually result. These persons are somewhat

but will not have a position or substantial base from which to
operate. People will not be naturally attracted to him, and he will
not have followers. He will, however, have a gift of timing and an
intuitiveness, which will keep him from having great difficulties.
He will have modest means, but not a particularly happy
life.
Least auspicious: He will not receive cooperation, and so will
not have the benefits that come from associations with good
friends and able peers. He will have a generally unhappy life.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official        He will be dismissed or demoted.
    Business and professional He will have difficulty maintaining
                               his position.
   Ordinary people             He will be plagued by lawsuits and
                               disputes. If old, he may die.
Line 5 The medlar tree leaves hide the fruit. It drops as if from
heaven.

This line refers to the kind of person who quietly and unassum-
ingly goes about his business, and at the same time is always im-
proving himself. No one pays particular attention to such persons,
and, in general, they are not well known, until suddenly the time
is propitious and they reap their reward as if it came from heaven.
These persons reflect great wisdom and common sense, since
their rising in this unobtrusive manner creates no opposition or
enemies. This is very beneficial.
Most auspicious: He will be very wise and open-minded. He
will love people and be able to treat all, the good and the bad alike,
impartially. He will be an exceptional speaker and writer, by the
means of which, with his learning and innate intelligence, he will
gain fame and fortune.
Least auspicious: He will also be diligent in learning as well as
being practical, with a love of people; but he will not rise as high
nor gain as much as the most auspicious.
 In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be appreciated and pro-
                                moted.

                               will help him make gains. Women
                               may become pregnant. The least
                               auspicious may die.
Line 6        He meets others with his horns. Some regrets. No
errors.

These persons are inclined to be impractical and reject the world.
They fail to realize that there is a right place for everything, and
will tend to withdraw from what they consider to be worldly
matters. When such matters encroach on them they will try to
guard themselves as if meeting them with horns. For these
persons such conduct brings few regrets and results in no great
error. Regrettably, they will be of little benefit to others.
Most auspicious: He will be lofty and upright, and have a strong
personality. His thoughts, actions and advice will be more moral
than practical, and evil persons will strive to harm him. His life
will be unstable, but adequate financially.
Least auspicious: He will be strong-minded, indomitable, and
unreasonable, and for the most part will disregard other people's
rights and feelings. Will tend to arouse ill will through his dislike
of people. He will be very busy, but to no great avail. Will have
many hardships.
 In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be reproached by his peers
                                and juniors for being in too high a

Hexagram 45      Ts'ui   =-=   Gathering Together (Assembling)


SIMPLE   TRANSLATION       OF TEXT
Gathering Together. Success. The king approaches his temple.
Advantageous to see the great man; then there will be success.
Great sacrifices generate good fortune. It is advantageous to
strive for a goal.

COMMENTARY
The gathering together is symbolized by the two trigrams forming
the hexagram, i.e. the lake over the earth. Waters gather from
all directions to form the lake, and thus assembled in one area are
available for nourishment. The upper trigram also denotes joy,
which reflects the pleasure of engaging in the enterprise depicted.
Only great leaders can bring about true assembling. Such persons
will do whatever duties are required, just as the king carries out
the rituals. Naturally, strength of character and singleness of
purpose are needed, along with a knowledge of what is right and
how to achieve it (symbolized by 'seeing the great man'), and the
offering of sacrifices. People instinctively adhere to what they
 know to be right, so a proper goal is a necessity as well. Few are
the individuals who can truly carry out the full import of this
 hexagram as a whole. Many will face these demands but will have
 short-comings, as reflected in the individual controlling lines.
   Those born in the sixth month will be more auspicious.
3   I   The Predictions

CONTROLLING         LINltS   (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line    1 If sincerity for union wavers, there will sometimes be
dispersal, sometimes gathering. If he cries out, then with one
grasp of the hand he can laugh again. No need for remorse. Ad-
vancing will be without error.

These persons will not be capable of meeting all the demands
imposed upon them without personal improvement and reforms.
People want strong leadership which provides acceptable guidance.
They will vacillate if the leadership wavers. The fourth line
normally helps the first, but the two intervening weak lines which
would also like support make this difficult. Help only comes to
these persons if they reach out and ask for it. Since this line is
weak where it should be strong, the help is not adequate to over-
come innate deficiencies. Cooperation, sociability and support
from friends and peers will not be readily forthcoming, so these
persons will not automatically fare well in life.
Most auspicious: He will be in a leading position, but stubborn,
and will stick to his own opinions despite facts and good advice;
frequently he will a.ccept the wrong advice. His gathering and
assembling will not be very beneficial to himself or to others un-
less he reforms.
Least auspicious: lie will lack in ability and moral character,


                                                                        I
and will vacillate frequently between good and evil. His life will
be one of hardship, with no real accomplishments.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be dismissed, or at least de-
                                moted.
   Business and prOfessional He will tend to be set in his ways
                                and opinions. He will have difficul-
                                ties if he opposes progress.
   Ordinary people              There will be troubles early in the
                                year, with things improving later.
Line 2 Letting oneself be drawn brings good fortune. No error.
With sincerity, even small offerings are acceptable.

Lines 2 and 5 are each of the proper nature for their positions,
hence line 2 is led by line 5. Permitting this brings good fortune
and is not wrong. Even though this line is in a secondary position,

it has the sincerity to support line 5. The results and efforts of
these persons will not be as great as those of a ruler, but neverthe-
less they will be deemed quite acceptable because of their inner
sincerity. Gathering together the varied requirements of a ruler
or leader calls for many specialized individuals in many walks of
life. All these persons will have a goal or noble purpose higher
than themselves, which they will be striving for and serving well
with deep sincerity.
Most auspicious: He will have a broad viewpoint, coupled with
practicality, common sense and energy. He will be loyal and
honest, and will be a good administrator, choosing the right
people for the right positions, and assigning them appropriate
duties within their capabilities. Thus work will be effectively and
efficiently accomplished. He will set a high personal standard,
which will be emulated readily by others. He will be above re-
proach, and will have a highly favorable and long life; he will
become known internationally.
Least auspicious: He will also be a good administrator who can
communicate well. He will easily obtain help from his juniors and

where finding it advantageous. Advancing is not erroneous. Slight
 humiliation.

Line 3 is held back from joining with, and being supported by,
line 6, through the deterrence of the two Yang lines, 4 and 5. It
cannot join with lines 4 or 2 either, since these are already cor-
related with their counterparts. Line 3 is thus alone, yet longing
for union and to be a part of a group. Fate decrees that this man
must travel alone and try to find someone with influence, who
can help him gain admission to the group of his choice. There is
some humiliation in having to act this way, but it is not wrong.

                                                                   519

His family business will decline. He will have to leave the clan and
make his own way alone, which he will do reasonably well, despite
many hardships and handicaps.

   Ordinary people             It will not be a pleasant year in
                               general. He will probably suffer the
                               loss of a close relative. If old he may
                               die.
Line 4 Great good fortune. No blame.

Great good fortune comes about because this is a strong line,
representing the minister, whose duty it is to gather matters
together for prosperity and peace. It is also the beginning of the
trigram Tui, joy, the function of which is nourishment. K'un, the
lower trigram, amongst its several meanings, stands for the
people. Line 4 is below line 5, the primary ruler of the hexagram.
Thus we find the minister appropriately supporting the ruler or
leader, and nourishing the people as well. This is a fortunate
combination, producing great good fortune. Line 4 is strong,
whereas normally it should be weak, but in view of the accom-
plishments attained, this engenders no blame. The masses will
flock to this man naturally. Regrettably, he may lose a proper
perspective and let himself be swayed from his course by the
adulation.
Most auspicious: He will be an extremely able administrator,
who will establish beneficial programs and methods which will be
effective and of value to the country, to its leader, and to the
people. His efforts will bring prosperity and peace. He will have a

very satisfying life, with many friends, a good family, and
wealth.
Least auspicious: He will also be talented, and ambitious, but as
he rises he will become vainglorious, and thereby lose his worth.
He will eventually bring harm to his enterprise and his family.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         Jealousies and misrepresentations
                               will be evident, and could be
                               damaging. Exercise care.
   Business and professional Beware of unethical practices or
                               procedures.
   Ordinary people             If one does not follow the golden
                               mean a disaster is inevitable.
Line 5 Gathering together through favorable position. No
error. If the confidence of the people is not present, it must be
gained through persistent correctness and exemplification of
virtue. Then regrets disappear.

Line 5 is a Yang, thus is a strong line in the right place, and in a
favorable position for gathering together. Those depicted here
always have the potential to be leaders, but are not always assigned
to leading positions (owing to the strong influence of line 4).
Therefore, when they do take over, if people do not already have
confidence in them, this must be earned by exemplary virtue of
conduct and persistent correctness. This will overcome all op-
position, and any occasion for remorse will disappear.
Most auspicious: He will be humble, modest and sage in the
exercise of true leadership. He will attain a high position and a
large salary, but he will not regard this as a glory. People will be
naturally attracted to him, and he will have a large following
which he will hold in respect rather than accept as an honor. He
will work persistently and diligently for the good of others. He
will have a long, rich and noble life.
Least auspicious: He will be a good leader in a minor capacity,
and will provide well for his family and himself while rendering
service to others.

                         will not go smoothly.
Line 6 Lamenting and weeping. No error.

Line 6 is isolated, and has no line with which to unite. That makes
this man sad, and he will tend to bemoan his fate. However, being
in this high position, he will turn his gaze inward. Externally, he
will not accomplish a great deal, but he will find satisfaction in
making inner improvements. Thus, at the top of the hexagram,
the gathering together is internal rather than external.
Most auspicious: Whenever things are peaceful he will re-
member that disaster can strike, and hence he will prepare him-
self as best he can, and will avoid troubles. He will not rise high
in worldly status, but through self-development he will find peace
in his soul, and with his family.
Least auspicious: He will be timid and weak in the external
world. He will not have many friends or associates to help him,
and will achieve little. He will not help himself to any great ex-
tent either.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He will have a year of troubles and

Hexagram   46   Sheng     ==   Rising (Ascending)


SIMPLE   TRANSLATION       OF TEXT
Rising. Supreme success. Seeking the great man eliminates ap-
prehension. Advancing towards the south brings good fortune.

COMMENTARY
The lower trigram is Sun, wood, which moves upward into the
upper trigram K'un, earth. Thus rising vertically is symbolized.
This is a step by step process, and produces supreme success. One
must strive for and follow what is right in order for one's path to
be correct, and to eliminate the apprehension and anxieties that
would otherwise enter in. The upper trigram represents the
south-west in the Sequence of Later Heaven, and stands for the
place where work is done and where matters should be brought
to completion. It also signifies the people. Thus, constantly pro-
gressing, working with people, and helping bring matters to
fruition produces good fortune. Like the tree which grows slowly,
this man's progress will come through patient, persistent and

    accumulations by the end of his lifetime will be great. He will be
    a strong, capable, intelligent, stable and persistent individual,
    who will achieve success upon success. Furthermore, the south
    represents clarity, so striving to increase one's clarity helps bring
    good fortune as well.
       Those born in the eighth month will be more auspicious.

    CONTROLLING          LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
    Line     I   Ascending brings great good fortune.

    This is the lowest line of the trigram Sun, wood, and indicates that
    seeds are sprouting and trees beginning to rise. This is welcomed
    by those above. Thus we have the right work and effort going on
    below, with the support and cooperation of those above. This
    working together produces great good fortune. These individuals
    will naturally attract others by their pleasing personality, their
    stability and character, and their serious intentions and diligent
    efforts.
    Most auspicious: He will be sincere, humble and modest, yet
    also wise, talented and communicative. He will instinctively draw
    people to him, and will often be offered unsolicited yet beneficial
    assistance. He will rise quite rapidly, but in a strong and stable
    manner. He will gain fame and fortune, and will also have a good
    family life.
    Least auspicious: He also will be liked by others and frequently
    assisted. He will cooperate and communicate well, his enterprises
    will prosper, and his household will be favored.
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official            Promotion can be expected.

                                      be fulfilled.
    Line 2 With sincerity, even a small sacrifice is acceptable. No
    error.

    A strong officer, the Yang line in position 2, is supported by a
    weak ruler, the Yin line in position 5. The sincerity of the officer
    is deeply rooted, and exemplified in all that he does. Even where

minimal support is required it is freely and sincerely given. No
errors are committed in such a relationship. Persons of ability and
loyalty, serving their ruler or a cause, as well as themselves, are
depicted here. Such persons are sought after, and are highly
esteemed in any organization.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of great virtue and strong
character, and greatly talented. He will be honest; just and forth-
right, and will follow the golden mean. He will accomplish great
and worthwhile tasks, for others and for himself, and will gen-
erate a rich and rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will be similar to the most auspicious, but
his achievements will be on a lesser scale and at a lower level.

Line J Rising as if into an empty city.

Line :5 is a strong line, at the top of the trigram Sun, wood, and
has only weak lines above it, so progress is easy, like taking over
an empty city. Its rising is unobstructed and it Can be expected to
proceed far. One should bear in mind, however, that this line is
symbolically a part of the tree, and therefore its progress will be
by gradual growth. Also, no mention is made of good fortune, and
this should be taken as a warning to be wary of too easy progress.
One should always remain true to one's pW'poses, and to the goals
and mores which one knows to be right. What is easily gained can
likewise be easily lost.
Most auspicious: He will rise to an important position and
govern part of the country, or become the president of a large
organization and lead well. He will have a good life with adequate
means.
Least auspicious: He will also be a good administrator, publicly
and privately. He may have a strong gambling instinct. Eventu-
ally he may choose a life of greater or lesser seclusion.

'Minister,' so the implication is that the minister was invited to
join in the sacrifice. To be invited to participate was a great honor,
indicative of being accepted and favored by the king. Thus this
line symbolizes a time when the individual finds that he can
attain his goals as well as rendering much service to the ruler and
the people. These are truly remarkable persons, both in character
and ability. They set a fine example, which others would do well
to emulate, with good fortune and no error resulting.
Most auspicious: He will be a minister by nature, and he will
lead by example. He will be kind, considerate and yielding (like
water), yet will remain true. He will approach the acme of sin-
cerity, and will be favored by those in authority. His work will be
beneficial and of lasting quality, and he will be fortunate in all
aspects of his life.
Least auspicious: He also will strongly influence people through
his ability and integrity. He will obtain a moderately high posi-
tion and adequate wealth, and will have a good family.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official            He will be appreciated by his
                                  seniors and respected by juniors.
                                  Promotion is probable.
    Business and professional Enterprises will be fostered by
                                  those in authority, and supported
                                  by the people.
    Ordinary people                Some will make favorable gains in
                                   minerals or forestry (or wood pro-
                                   ducts). All will benefit from going
                                  to a mountainous region. All should
                                  be godfearing, and most will be.
 Line 5 Correct advancement step by step. Good fortune.

Able leaders, who administer their duties and responsibilities in
an efficient and effective manner, in keeping with the golden
mean, are depicted here. They will be natural leaders, and will

develop their leadership potential through learning and the wis-
dom of experience. They will be a blessing wherever they are.
Most auspicious: He will be recognized for his leadership and
abilities early in his career. He will be a man of broad vision, a
capable communicator who will promote and consummate large
and worthwhile undertakings. His desires will be fulfilled and he
will have a long, rich and rewarding life.
Least auspicious: His life will be similar to the most auspicious,
but in a lesser degree.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will receive a well-earned pro-
                                motion.
   Business and professional He will be personally recommen-
                                ded, as well as having his efforts
                                supported or sponsored.
   Ordinary people              Strong desires will be fulfilled.
Line 6 Ascending blindly. Unremitting correctness advan-
tageous.

Some individuals have a compulsive drive to constantly keep
moving forward. They never truly stop to rest and relax, or to
reassess their situation. It is a blind inner urge that keeps them
trying to move ahead, without adequate plans and preparations,
or knowledge of possible support. That no man is an island is one
of the basic tenets of I Ching, and forging ahead alone here will
lead to difficulties and disasters, unless actions are unremittingly
correct.
Most auspicious: He will overcome compulsive urges and culti-
vate himself personally and professionally to the point where his
inner being will create a successful life for him, both in his work
and with his family.
Least auspicious: He will be greedy, mean inconsiderate, and
constantly pushing in his efforts to gain status and profit. His
actions will bring much unavoidable opposition and ill will. He
will have a hard life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He will probably retire this year.
   Business and professional If he cultivates himself, personally
                                 and professionally, he can retain
                                 his position.
         5     I   The Predictions
               Ordinary people                 Greediness will create opposmon,

         KEYNOTES
         1.    It is beneficial to become a good communicator.
         2.    Services sincerely rendered will be duly rewarded.
         3.    Beware of seemingly easy situations.
         40.   Righteous development brings its own rewards.
         5.    Service to others is always beneficial.

         CONDENSATIONS               FOR   DAILY   CYCLES
         1.  The seeds are sprouting. Forward progress and good fortune are
         assured. Those above are in accord.
         2. Be filled with faith gained from ancient wisdom, and further
         progress will be assured.
         3. The course of action taken will cause no doubts to rise in the
         minds of others. Even though things seem easy, check again that
         no mistakes have been made.
         40. Now you will start to attain your goals. Do not forget reverence
         to God and adherence to duty and tradition.
         5. It is only through righteousness, persistently and correctly
         made a part of one's life, that full success can be achieved. Be
         guided accordingly.
         6. Constant advance today may be dangerous. Reassess your
         situation. Learn what is the right thing to do before proceeding;
         blind impulses can be dangerous.

potential to be beneficial. If they do not use it, or fail to develop it
properly, they can expect adversity. By a similar token, if they do
not let themselves be overcome by adverse conditions they can
still achieve success through indomitable will-power, persever-
ance in right courses, and by cultivating the inner optimism and
faith of a great man. In this way they free themselves from error.
Regrettably, the factors influencing this man's life are largely
negative, since both trigrams have a downward trend. Therefore
his accomplishments will not be great and he will be hampered by
conditions beyond his control, unless he heeds the warnings and
advice given. Actions, and not words, are required.
   Those born in the fifth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES    (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line   IHe sits in adversity under a bare tree. He wanders in a
gloomy valley. For three years he remains in darkness.

The words used here present the picture of a person at the lowest
point of adversity. Everything is dark and dismal around him. He
sees nothing, and takes no action. Also he has no protection, like
a man sitting under a bare tree. If he lets adversity conquer him,
he must resign himself to failure. If he is strong and wise enough
to continue in what is right, he will eventually find a way out of
his situation. Becoming exhausted is dangerous, for chance will
then take over. However, through rebuilding and application,
good fortune will return.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of noble character and virtue
but will have little or no opportunity to be useful. His sphere of
activity will be limited, and he will gain neither fame nor for-
tune. On the other hand, life will not be particularly bad either.
Least auspicious: He will be muddle-headed and lacking in
common sense. He will not see things clearly. He will find himself
in financial or other straits, and not know how to, or be able to,
work his way out of them.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will have to retreat or withdraw
                                from otherwise favorable situations.
   Business and professional A time of waiting. One should re-
                                vitalize one's professional know-
                                ledge.
15 / The Predictions
   Ordinary people           Some major worries or fears are
                             imminent.
Line 2 Adversity during food and drink. The wearer of a scarlet
knee cover arrives. Engaging in sincere sacrifice advantageous.
Actions lead to misfortune but no errors.

Some people rise in spite of themselves rather than because of
themselves. This is the result of their karma, or destiny. These
persons are sincere in their attitude to the universe and life, and
are helped by persons with greater authority. (In ancient times
princes wore scarlet knee covers.) However, if these persons try to
lead or to strike out on their own, misfortune will result. Cooperat-
ing with others, and accepting help, is the best way for them.
Most auspicious: He will be a very personable man, with much
knowledge and a good character, who will attain a high position
as a result of help from others (perhaps through inheritance)
rather than through his own merit. He will enjoy a large salary,
and will avoid troubles and let others make decisions.
Least auspicious: He will be ostentatious, biased, aloof, sensuous,
and self-indulgent. He vvill have sufficient means for food and
drink. He will not accomplish anything lasting.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He can expect promotion, and
                                 activity if previously inactive.
   Business and professional His activities will be rewarded in
                                 some unusual way.
   Ordinary people               He will be helped by someone in
                                 authority. He will make gains and
                                 profits. It would be best not to start
                                 anything new.
Line}      Adversity like being trapped in rock. He leans on thorns
and thistles. He enters his home and does not see his wife, Mis-
fortune .

. As this is the topmost line of the trigram K'an, danger, there is
  virtually complete exhaustion here. These persons will be restless
  and indecisive, with a tendency to fail to see things as they really
  are. The result is that only menial tasks are able to be performed
  successfully, and then only under specific guidance and direction.
  Most auspicious: He will become a doorman, waiter, or butler,



                                                                          J

or have some similar job, or else he will live in the mountains and
forests and largely idle his time away. He will most likely never
marry, or if he does it will not last. He will remain generally
healthy throughout his life.
Least auspicious: He will have no character, talent or ambition,
and will lead a solitary life plagued by many hardships and troubles.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official             He will be demoted, dismissed, or
                                   arrested.
   Business and professional Unexpected troubles from closely
                                   related sources will arise.
   Ordinary people                 He can expect family difficulties,
                                   and perhaps some serious trouble
                                   generated by his wife. Loss of
                                   reputation and death are also
                                   possible.
Line 4 Journeying slowly. He faces adversity 10 a golden
carriage. He is reproached. Good ending.

Anyone who is riding in a carriage, even though he may be in
authority, is relying on inferiors. Line 4 should receive support
from its inferior, line 1, but that line's efforts are diverted by,
the strong line (z) above it. Since line z is symbolic of a metal
carriage, the adversity of line 4 is blamed upon it. Thus this
person will find himself advancing slowly, and often relying on
inferiors who do not render the proper support. He will be re-
proached as he is not wise enough to choose better helpers. Noting
his mistakes as a result of analyzing his slow progress, he can make
corrective changes. The results will be good.
Most auspicious: He will rise very slowly in his Career hut even-
tually will reach a high and respected position. He will receive
little help along the way, and his achievements will be the result
 of constant self-improvement, both personally and professionally.
 Apart from his slowness, and having to work largely alone, he will
 have a good life.
 Least auspicious: He will have many hardships at first. Later he
 will be helped by a rich or powerful person, and will have
 achievements, but always under the control and guidance of this
 person. In his senior years his life will become easier and he will
 be more independent.

                             side influences, e.g. the economy or
                             the state of national affairs.
   Ordinary people           He will have many minor troubles,
                             but these will all be overcome.
Line 5 His nose and feet are cut off. Adversity generated by the
man with a scarlet knee cover. Joy comes slowly. It is advan-
tageous to offer sacrifices.

Having the nose and feet cut off was a mild form of punishment
in earlier days. The judgment was, of course, rendered by those
in authority, i.e. the persons wearing scarlet knee covers. Through
persistent and righteous actions, and appropriate reverence, a
reprieve will be granted to these persons and joy will gradually
enter into their lives. They have character traits that "ill handi-
cap them early on in life, and their efforts and intentions will
often be misunderstood, as they do not conform to the customs
and mores of their society. Eventually their value and usefulness
will be recognized, and, since this is the fifth line, they have the
potential to rise to high positions.
Most auspicious: He will be diligent in the learning of ancient
wisdom, and will courageously carry out what he believes is right.
His actions will not always conform to present practices, so he
will at first have many difficulties in his profession. Eventually he
will rise to a high position, and have a good life.
Least auspicious: He will have hardships at first, but an accept-
able life later. He may have serious health problems, or his close
friends or relatives may be jailed.
In yearly hexagram:
   For everyone                 There will be hindrances and
                                troubles early in the year, with
                                things smoothing out later.
Line 6 Encumbered by creeping vines. Indecisive, he thinks, 'If
I move I shall regret it.' With repentance, advancing will be pro-
ductive of good fortune.

The adversity is coming to an end, and one has only a few creeping

vines to remove. This can easily be done by repentance. Proceed-
ing forward will bring good fortune. These persons will start out
in life with many hindrances, both externally and those resulting
from their own attitudes. These can all be easily overcome. It will
he through a deep introspection, analysis and reassessment con-
ducted at some point in their lives that they will see truly the
errors ofthe past, andset forth on a new and highly successfulcourse.
Most auspicious: He will learn, and discover how to reform early
in life, and will then cultivate and follow the golden mean. He
will gain sound professional knowledge and experience, and this
will permit him to overcome adversities.
Least auspicious: He will be weak-minded and unambitious.
He will always be the scapegoat for troubles and adversity. Later
in life, and after much loneliness, he will begin through great
personal effort to establish himself.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He may be reprimanded, punished,
                                 demoted or even dismissed.
   Business and professional His efforts will be misunderstood
                                 early in the year, but there will be
                                 some improvement later on.
   Ordinary people               He will face many worries, and
                                 probably an unexpected event
                                 which will alter circumstances later
                                 in the year.

         Hexagram       48   Ching    ==   The Well


         SIMPLE       TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
         The Well. The town may be moved but the well remains un-
         changed. The water never increases nor decreases, and those who
         come and go can draw from it. If the rope is too short or the
         bucket broken before reaching the water-misfortune.

         COMMENTARY
         The well is symbolized in the upper trigram, K'an, water, and the
         lower trigram Sun, wood, giving the picture of water in a bucket
         being lifted from a well. It indicates that nourishment is perma-
         nently available for all who come and go, regardless of where they
         live. Those depicted here will have the potential for doing good
         deeds and rendering beneficial service, and for teaching the right
         things to others. All men, by the nature of earthly existence, are
         both salesmen and teachers. One is a salesman in that one is con-
         stantly selling oneself to others, consciously or unconsciously. Simi-
         larly, one is a teacher through the words one speaks or writes, the
         acts one performs, and by the example one sets whenever and
l,   I
         wherever one is observed. Those depicted here will have a
         well above average tendency to influence others. They should
I'       be aware of this, so that their speech and actions may be as bene-
         ficial as possible. Regrettably, this power will sometimes remain
         unconscious, or else be forgotten.
            Those born in the third month will be more auspicious.

         CONTROLLING          LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
         Line I The muddy water at the well bottom is unfit to drink.
         Even animals will not drink from an old well.

         The bottom of the well is so muddy that neither humans nor
                                              3   I   The Predictions
animals will drink from its waters. The way that a well becomes
muddy is through agitation, or else through need of renewal.
Wise persons do not cause agitation. Hence persons with little
knowledge or common sense are depicted. Many will be rabble
rousers, with extreme ideas which people in general will not want
to accept. They will have little of true value to offer.
Most auspicious: He will have some talent and knowledge, but
will not have the common sense to use it properly, and so his life
will be ruled by chance. He will not accomplish anything worth-
while, and will have difficulty earning a modest living and pro-
viding for himself and his family.
Least auspicious: He will live in poverty in a ghetto or evil
surroundings. He will be unambitious, a drifter, an idler and a
wastrel.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official        A year of retreat.
    Business and professional He will be opposed at every turn.
    Ordinary people            Those seeking to advance will fail.
                               Hold back. The least auspicious
                               may die.
 Line 2 The fish dart at the wellhole. Water leaks from the
broken bucket.

Both of these sentences indicate that very little nourishment is
available. When fish dart out from a wellhole it means that the
water has nearly all leaked away. The implication is that this man
can nourish himself adequately but will never be qualified nor in
a position to nourish, and truly be of benefit to, others.
Most auspicious: He will refine and cultivate himself by study-
ing the humanities and the arts. His work will never come to the
attention of anyone of influence or real importance. He will lead
a modest life and find contentment in his studies rather than
through accomplishments.
Least auspicious: He will also study, but will not learn much,
and in general he will be impractical. He may have a serious ill-
ness or injury, or long-standing troubles. He will barely be able to
support himself and his family.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Relax or retreat and enjoy your
                                own life.

   Ordinary people             Do not attempt anything new, or
                               troubles will develop.
Line}    The well has been cleaned but is not yet used. Men's
hearts sorrow over this, for the water might be drawn and used.
If the king were wise, mutual good fortune might result.

Line 3 is the top of the bucket. This is the point from which
nourishment should be drawn. It is a strong line in a strong place
so its potential is great, and the people wish that the king would
make use of this asset. But, having no correlate, the line remains
isolated, and no one gains any real value from the situation. Fate
or destiny often prevents persons from rendering valuable service
to others, even though they may be excellent, well-qualified in-
dividuals. Such is the case here.
Most auspicious: He will have a noble character, and be a man
of vision and knowledge. He could be useful to the government
and the ruler, but he will remain relatively unknown. He will
render service to the poor and the needy, and will gain a favorable
reputation over a limited area. He will also gain wealth through
good investment.
Least auspicious: He also will be a man of good character who
will accumulate some money. His efforts to be of use will always
be frustrated by outside influences or an unexpected turn of
events. He will have many worries and few friends.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           Retreat and cultivate yourself.
   Business and professional Hold back, and bring yourself up
                                 to date in your profession.
   Ordinary people               Be content with where you are and
                                 what you have.
Line 4 The well is being lined. No error.

The general message of this hexagram is that one should nourish
(and teach) others, but only when one is duly prepared. As this is
the lowest line of trigram K'an, water, these persons are not yet
fully ready to teach and guide others. Their destiny is primarily
to cultivate themselves; then, when due progress has been made,
they can turn to external matters beneficially. In the meantime it

behoves them to learn every possible lesson, wherever they are
and whatever they are doing. They should be perpetual students,
both in and out of school.
Most auspicious: He will be mild and cautious, and will obey
customs, mores, and laws rigorously. He will be reverent. However,
he will be indecisive and will lack the courage to take a firm stand
or make major decisions. He will provide modestly for himself and
his family.
Least auspicious: He will always have ideas as to what should
be done, but he will never get others to accept them, nor will he
carry them through himself. He will accomplish virtually nothing.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          It will be beneficial to initiate
                                practical innovations and to curb
                                what is harmful.
   Business and professional A good year to hold back and bring
                                oneself up to date in one's pro-
                                fession.

                                or to till the land, mine, or sink a
                                well.
Line 5 The well is fed by a clear, cool spring from which every-
one can drink freely.

Great leaders are depicted here, who have the welfare of others at
heart and lead primarily through service. The more they give the
more they have to give. They are like a clear, cool spring, giving
inexhaustible nourishment. Line 5 is the ruler, and as it is a
strong line in the right place, much good is presaged for all con-
cerned.
Most auspicious: He will have the talent to become the leader
of a nation, and also a world leader. He will be a man of vision
and strong character, virtuous and decisive, with a great love
of people. His work and efforts will be beneficial to many and
will have far-reaching effects. He will be famous, rich and
noble.
Least auspicious: He also will be a good man like the most
auspicious, but at a lower level, with only modest accomplish-
ments. He will have a very satisfactory and satisfying life.

                                                                  557

  Officer or official        He will be assigned to a high posi-
                             tion and will perform his tasks

   Business and professional He will achieve an increased repu-

   Ordinary people           He will have good gains in his
                             business or enterprises.
Line 6 The well is not concealed and the rope is available. It is
dependable. Great good fortune.

In ancient times, in times of drought, wells were often concealed,
or protected against unauthorized use. Here the well is freely
visible, and the means for obtaining the water are readily avail-
able. Consequently this line represents sage persons who freely
and impartially dispense blessings, through their teachings,
writings or advice. This brings many benefits and great good
fortune.
Most auspicious: He will be a great humanitarian, in thought,
word and deed, showering many blessings on others, and helping
them to develop and prosper. He will also make gains personally
and professionally.
Least auspicious: He will be in a consultant, research, teaching
or artistic position where his work will have much influence on
others. He will have a modestly affluent and smooth life.

   Officer or official         He will be promoted, because of
                               special merit.
   Business and professional He will enhance his reputation and
                               render much beneficial service.
   Ordinary people             He will have enough for his needs,
                               and some extra for special purposes.

    SIMPLE     TRANSLATION        O~' TEXT
    Change. When change has been completed then it is believed.
    Supreme success. Determined perseverance in correctness ad-
    vantageous. Regrets vanish.

    COMMENTARY
    Fire is below water, and therefore a change is inevitable. Either
    the fire will boil away the water, or the water will extinguish the
    fire. Li, summer, is below Tui, fall, another symbolism that indi-
    cates change. Also, Li is the sun and Tui is the west, and the sun
    in the west denotes the change from day to night. In a personal
    sense, the hexagram shows clarity within and the lake without.
    Thus the potential for nourishing others with clarity is depicted;
    and this is achieved through change. No action in this respect
    should be taken unless it is a definite necessity and the time is ripe,
    and only by one who is duly qualified and called to the task.
    People tend tu view change with suspicion. It is only after changes
    have been successfully implemented that faith and belief develop
    in them, through the perseverance and determined correctness
    of the leaders. Those with this natal hexagram will be leaders,
    and able to make beneficial changes, when the time is ripe,

                                                                            339

throughout their lives. They are also able to regulate matters for
the benefit of others. The nature of their actions, however, will
be governed by their controlling line.
   Those born in the second month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING           LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line     I   Bound by yellow oxhide.

In this hexagram, line 1 is not only the lowest point of the evolu-
tion but is also without a correlate or outside help, so this man is
limited in his actions, as if bound by yellow oxhide. Yellow is the
symbol of the mean, and the ox represents docility. These persons
see many things which need to be changed or corrected, but
recognize that change should only be initiated when no other al-
ternative is available. They will follow the golden mean and have
a calm existence, but fate and destiny will not place these persons
in a position to take action. Thus they seem bound.
Most auspicious: He will have much knowledge and ability,
and will find satisfactory positions, but never the ones best suited
to him. He will be content, however, since he will have a modest
life free from major difficulties.
Least auspicious: He will live in lowly surroundings and per-
form menial or difficult tasks. He will be quite poor, but he also
will have no major difficulties.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           Hold back, and do not attempt
                                 change or advance.
   Business and professional All plans and proposals should be
                                 built on firm and proven founda-
                                tions. Anything new will bring mis-
                                 fortune.
    Ordinary people              Learn to be content with where
                                 you are and what you have this
                                 year, and you will avoid serious
                                 troubles.
Line 2 When the time is ripe, make changes. Advancing then
brings good fortune. No error.

Line 2 is the center of the trigram Li, clarity, which is in the
inner position. These persons possess therefore an inner clarity,
                                                 3 / The Predictions
and the ability to analyze, to lay strategic plans and to understand
cause and effect; in addition they have a keen sense of timing as
to when changes should take place. They are strong individuals,
who will support their ruler or leader through thorough staff
work, and in the execution of approved plans; they are knowledge-
able persons of firm character and broad vision.
Most auspicious: He will be an exceptional person who is able to
correctly analyze situations, determine the seeds of the future in
present conditions, and wait for the seeds to ripen. He will be
trusted by the ruler and respected by the people. He will be
assigned heavy responsibilities, and will carry out his duties
efficiently, effectively and beneficially. He will have a favorable
life.
Least auspicious: He also will be broadminded and kind-hearted,
handling matters in a proper and useful manner. He will replace
the old with something new at propitious times, He too will have
a favorable life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He can expect a change in position.
    Business and professional He will gain a favorable reputation.
   Ordinary people              He will have several joyous oc-
                                currences.
Line J Advancing precipitously brings misfortune. Persistence
leads to danger. When change has been thrice discussed one may
act and will be believed.

Line 3 is a strong line in the right place. Hence this man is in-
clined to pursue courses of action, but as this line represents clarity
on the wane his actions will tend to be made in haste, and without
due consideration. If this were persisted in, danger would result.
On the other hand, where matters have been fully and carefully
deliberated, actions can be commenced with the acceptance and
confidence of others assured. Throughout their lives, these indi-
viduals must beware of the danger of acting hastily in matters
facing them, even though there will be a strong natural tendency
to do so. They should train themselves to act deliberately and only
after due consideration, and, as far as possible, obtain strong
support in advance.
Most auspicious: He will always act in a calm, leisurely and
deliberate manner. He will understand the laws of cause and

effect, especially relating to people as individuals and as members
of a group. He will act in a careful, thorough and timely manner,
and the results will be beneficial. He will gain fame and fortune.
Least auspicious: He will act rashly and hastily most of the time,
and as a result will have many hardships, face frequent difficulties,
and fail to establish himself adequately.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He may make one or more hasty
                                 major decision, with unfavorable
                                 results.
   Business and professional It will take an extra effort to attain
                                 one's aims this year.
   Ordinary people               He will have many disputes, within
                                 and without the family circle.
Line 4 Regrets disappear. There is confidence. Changing the
ordinances brings good fortune.

  The total upward effect of the trigram Li, clarity, is first felt here
  in line 4, the position of the minister. These persons will first
  prepare themselves adequately for the high positions which they
  know intuitively they will attain, and subsequently participate in
  some major change of grave importance. They will be responsible
  for turning the old into the new, and their renovations and
  changes will bring good fortune, as a result both of the new rules
  and their just and beneficial administration of them.
  Most auspicious: He will be a highly developed person of strong
  and good character, with a love of what is right and just. He will
  prepare himself constantly and at some time will participate in a
  major renovation of the administration. This will be welcomed
  by the people and appreciated by the ruler. He will always be a
  capable administrator, in both his personal and professional life.
  Least auspicious: He will also be knowledgeable and magnani-
  mous, and a successful administrator at a lower level. He will have
  hardships at first, then a good and easy life. He will travel con-
. siderably.
  In yearly hexagram:
     Officer or official         He will be promoted.
     Business and professional All his efforts will receive favorable
                                 consideration, and benefits will
                                 accrue.

                              good fortune.
Line 5 The great man changes like a tiger. He does not need to
use divination. Others repose faith in him.

Line 5 is the ruler of the hexagram, and the changes that this
man makes are as dynamic and clear as the stripes of a tiger. He
is so highly developed, both personally and professionally, and
possessing such a degree of innate widom and perception, that he
does not need to employ divination in order to know what to
correct, how and when to make the corrections, and how to obtain
the necessary support. He acts, and faith is reposed in all he does.
Everyone will have confidence in him. He will be a very strong
leader and a highly efficient, effective administrator.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of rare talents. Great
responsibilities will be placed upon him. He will be outstanding,
personally and professionally, and his work will be of great and
lasting benefit. He will achieve fame and fortune, and will have a
very favorable life.
Least auspicious: He will be favored by destiny, and will also
have a good life. He will be a good administrator, making reforms
as needed. He will accomplish his desires.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be promoted and assigned
                                to a more responsible position.
   Business and professional He will enjoy advancement in his
                                efforts, and additional recompense.
   Ordinary people              Life will be enjoyable this year.
Line 6 The superior man changes like a leopard. The inferior
man changes his face. Advancing now brings misfortune. Being
persevering and constant brings good fortune.

Here, as is often the case with the sixth line, the time for propi-
tious action has passed. In this case this relates to making changes.
If they are made, the superior man will make them with the
detailed clarity of a leopard's spots, but the inferior man will
merely change his allegiance. In general, it is best for these
persons not to initiate any changes, but rather to follow through
those changes which have already been directed or implemented,
in order to derive the maximum benefit. These persons will be
3    I   The Predictions
potentially good administrators, but on the whole as technicians
rather than planners or strategists.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of strong executive ability,
communicative and decisive. He will gain a favorable reputation
and have a high salary. He will have a reasonably good life.
Least auspicious: He will often act rashly, and pretend to be an
expert or to have more knowledge than he actually does; this will
result in extensive troubles unless he changes his ways.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         Those in power should retreat.
                               Those not in power will advance.
   Business and professional A good year, but only if major
                               changes are avoided.
   Ordinary people             He should obey laws and keep out
                               of trouble.

KEYNOTES
1. All changes must be timely.
2. Changes must be well thought out.
3. Changes must be agreed to by others.
4. Be in the right position before trying to carry out reforms.
5. Strong leadership is vital for major changes.
6. After changes have been initiated, work persistently to make
them effective.

CONDENSATIONS              FOR   DAILY   CYCLES
1.  Reflect. The time is too early for change. You are still limited
in your possible actions, and you are alone.
2. There is now great potentiality for actions that will bring suc-
cess. One knows the right time to move forward, and should
maintain a correct inner attitude.
5. Only thoroughly discussed changes, and those having the
support of others, should be made. Work for the support of others.
4. The time is right for making such changes as have been duly
prepared. Act, and success will be yours.
 5. You intuitively know what to do, and will spontaneously win
the support of others.
 6. A superior man can take action, but an inferior man should re-
 main firm. Each in his own way should be satisfied with what is
 attainable.

Hexagram     50   Ting    ==   The Cauldron (Sacrificial   Vessel)


SIMPLE     TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
The Cauldron. Supreme success.

COMMENTARY
The ting was a tripodal vessel of bronze with two handles, used
in ancient times primarily for sacrificial rituals. It is a symbol of
spiritual power and an emblem of imperial power. The hexa-
gram, being composed of fire over wood, signifies purification of
the self and an unlimited spiritual nourishing of others. The
highest earthly values are sacrificed in the support and the foster-
ing of divine purposes, and this is what these individuals should
strive to emulate. The controlling lines begin with the emptying of
oneself to make room for the good, and progress to the apex where
the good is dispensed with the blessing of heaven. The sixty-four
hexagrams cover all aspects of life, and this one primarily deals
with the mental and spiritual development of oneself and others,
and is considered one of the more important hexagrams from the
point of view of acting in accordance with the plan of heaven.
This is not a separate career, per se, but a seven days a week,
twenty-four hours a day activity. Those who have this as their
natal hexagram will have a special purpose in connection with
matters of spiritual development. Some will be involved visibly
and others will be active behind the scenes. They may be found
in almost any worldly career.
   Those born in the twelfth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line I The ling is overturned, feet up. Advantageous to get rid
of spoiled meat. One takes a concubine for the sake of bearing
sons. No error.

The two images have different meanings but are equally applic-
able. In the first instance, that which is old and useless must be
removed in order to make room for something new and more
beneficial to enter in. A man's mind will not accept two divergent
ideas simultaneously. In the second instance, it is set forth that if

                                                                 3+5
A vital part of a man's immortality, according to the Chinese, is
the continuation of his lineage, which can only be achieved by
having sons. Thus, taking a concubine for the sake of having a son
is not wrong. 'While the previous hexagram dealt primarily with
changes in the physical realm, this one is concerned more with the
mental realm. Teachers, artists and literati are depicted here.
Most auspicious: He will cultivate virtue, learning and tech-
niques of communication. He w-ill rise early in his career and
establish a favorable, influential reputation. His later life will be
very beneficial and fruitful.
Least auspicious: He will face hardships early in life, with con-
ditions slowly improving. He will leave home and travel con-
siderably, and will gain some wealth but will fail to achieve fame.
He may marry several times in order to have an heir.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will achieve success out of ap-
                                parent failure, and be promoted.
   Business and professional He will revitalize something that
                                has become stale, and gain in
                                reputation and recompense.
   Ordinary people               He will gain profits with the help of
                                others. Any adverse condition will
                                improve.
Line 2 There is sacrificial food in the ting. Believing my enemies
cannot harm me; they will not. Good fortune.

Another law of mental life is expressed here, i.e, that when a man
is full of faith, that which he believes will tend to be realized. This
is the next step in personal mental cultivation after the old has
been removed. This line implies great determination, positive
hope, and a true ability to concentrate, which are three attributes
common to all great men.
Most auspicious: He will have positive goals, strong determina-
tion, and great powers of concentration. He will have a noble
character and will work for the betterment of himself and others.
He will be in a high position, with heavy and far-reaching re-
sponsibilities, and will be an important figure in his nation and
the world. He will have an active and rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will also be a magnanimous, sincere,
                                                    5   I   The Predictions
    honest and upright person, with keen mental faculties. He will
    serve others well, and will have a more than ample income for
    himself and his family. He will be envied by others.
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official         It is recommended that he act
                                   strictly according to the rules; he
                                   should be wary of misrepresenta-
                                   tion.
       Business and professional Only strong, concentrated efforts
                                   will meet with recognition.
       Ordinary people             He will make gains but is likely to
                                   be at the receiving end of some un-
                                   pleasantness.    He may become
                                   seriously ill.
    Line}     The ears (handles) of the ling have been altered. Pro-


I   gress is hampered. The fat of the pheasant is not eaten. Rain falls,
    and regrets disappear. In the end, good fortune.

    Line 5, a part of the body of the ling, does not receive help from
    line 5, the ears, so it is as if the ears have been altered. Conse-
    quently, the sacrificial food is not available for eating. Gradually
    line 6 gains the strength to overcome line 5, and help line 5.
    Once this is done the situation clears, as after rain, and regrets
    disappear. Thus good fortune comes in the end. The concepts in-
    volved in this line are, first that, in the mental realm as in the
    physical, to every action there is a reaction, and, second, that
    every thought or idea brings about a corresponding physical
    reaction. This person is confused and hampered in his progress by
    erroneous thinking. Through continued effort his mind will
    gradually clear, and his life and development will then become
    stable, beneficial and rewarding.
    Most auspicious: He will devote much energy in his early life
    to self-development and self-improvement without having a
    specific external goal, and hence will not have a basis from which
    to grow until he sees his error and makes the necessary changes in
    his life, which will then improve.
    Least auspicious: His life will be full of hardships and difficulties.
    He may even use immoral means to attain his aims. Later he will
    reform, and with his altered attitude begin to achieve something
    worthwhile.

                                                                        5407
5   ! The   Predictions




                                                                       I
In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official          The actions of a wicked official will
                               hamper one's efforts, until the evil
                               is overcome.
  Business and professional Matters will move only with diffi-
                               culty until late in the year.
  Ordinary people              An auspicious year for older people.
                               Young people will face troubles and
                               hardships.
Line 4 The legs of the ting are broken. The prince's meal is
spoiled and his person soiled. Misfortune.

The fourth line is the position of the minister, who ought to dis-
seminate nourishment to the people and support the ruler. In this
case he does not receive the support of line I, as indicated by the
                                                                       r
                                                                       ,
legs of the ling being broken. In serving alone, the minister is
inept, and spills the food in the ling over the prince. As far as
mental activity is concerned, this implies that ideas must have a
sound foundation in order to be useful, and also that the longer
an idea remains in the mind the more opposition there will be to
its replacement. The minister's actions are ill considered, and
since the actions are wrong, the attitude of mind behind them is
wrong also. He is using old ideas and methods which ought to be
replaced. If this person does not exercise due forethought, mis-
fortune will result.
Most auspicious: He will. hold a high pOSItIOn, but will
employ obsolete ideas and! or unsuitable persons for the advance-
ment of his country. This will result in opposition, much bicker-
ing, and other troubles. While having ample means to meet
his personal needs, he will not be happy or satisfied with his
life.
Least auspicious.: He will be in a high administrative position
and will use his mental powers for evil purposes and personal
gains. He will frequently rely on force rather than persuasion,
and will have an unstable personal and professional life.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official        He will be dismissed or demoted.
    Business and professional Opportunities for gain will come to
                               nothing.

                          or foot trouble. The less auspicious
                          may die.
Line 5 The ting has yellow handles, with golden rings. Firm
correctness advantageous.

Line 5 is correctly placed and duly supported. Yellow implies
following the golden mean; the golden rings imply that one's
actions are particularly effective. From the point of view of mental
activity, this line points to the fact that imagination is more
powerful than knowledge when dealing with one's own mind or
with the minds of others. Firm correctness is essential in order for
good and not evil to result, especially when influencing the minds
of others, as is done by leaders.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of noble character and great
virtue, and wise in the ways to handle men. He may be employed
in the government of his country or to negotiate for his country,
and he will be an example well worth emulating. He will be
trusted by the leaders, and respected by his associates and by the
people. He will have a rich and rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He also will be an honest, noble person, good
at communicating with people, and of benefit to any enterprise
with which he associates. He will have a good and prosperous
household and business, and will have much good fortune.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           A very good year. He will be as-
                                 signed to a high position, or will
                                 win a prize.
   Business and professional Written efforts will be especially
                                 effective. He will reap gains and
                                 win a coveted award.
   Ordinary people               A favorable year in many respects,
                                 with substantial gains.
Line 6 The ling has rings of jade. Great good fortune. Every-
thing is beneficial now.

A truly wise person renders service to his leader and nourishes the
people, just asthe rings serve a ling. Jade is hard, pure and valuable,
and possessesa soft luster, thus signifying that this person possesses
an exceptionally beneficial quality of leadership in what is desir-
able and right. This is enhanced by a love of people, which shows

                                                                  549

itself in penetrating consideration and tolerance. On the mental
plane, this line indicates that the finest actions spring naturally
from a perfected, conscious inner self. Those depicted here will be
among the most highly developed individuals in the world, and
will exert a beneficial influence wherever they are.
Most auspicious: He will be exceptionally wise in leading, guid-
ing, and understanding people. He will be a man of great virtue,
thoughtful and communicative. Everything will go his way, and
he will be of great benefit to others. He will have a rich and
rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He also will be fine and noble, but will live in
seclusion, helping others indirectly, through ideas, writings and
philanthropy. He also will have a highly satisfying life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Those in active positions will re-
                                treat; those in inactive positions
                                will advance. All will exert much
                                influence.
   Business and professional His actions and efforts will be sup-
                                ported and promoted by others.
   Ordinary people              A good, stable year, with gains.

Hexagram 51      eMn   ==    Thunder (Arousing)


SIMPLE   TRANSLATION       OF TEXT
Thunder generates success. Thunder comes amid gaiety and glee.
It terrifies people for a hundred miles. He does not let the sacri-
ficial spoon spill its spirits.

C01\'IMENTARY
The name of the hexagram derives from it being the trigram
Chen doubled. Chen also represents springtime, when the renewal
of life becomes evident and the earth restores its bounty. This
brings joy and success. The manifestations of the divine also bring
renewed hope and cheer to those capable of understanding them,
while they induce great fear in the hearts of others. Anyone who
is higWy developed, and full of virtue and understanding, will be
so calm under all circumstances that even if thunder occurs
during sacrificial rites it will not disturb him. From a personal
point of view, this is a time for renewal and for coming out from
within oneself to develop and to be of benefit to others. These
persons will be innovators, instigators, and prime movers in pro-
gressive movements. Their actions will be mainly impartial
rather than for gain, although some will use these traits for sel-
fish purposes.
   Those born in the tenth month will be more auspicious than
the rest, of which those born between the second and the eighth
month will be the more auspicious.

CONTROLLING      LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line I Apprehension when thunder comes. Afterwards gaiety,
laughing and glee. Good fortune.

There is a movement stirring within the society, and much ap-
prehension regarding its possible success. Since this is a time for
growing and advancing, the movement will be productive and
3   I   The Predictions
followed by happiness and good fortune. Since this line is correct
and in its right place, the leadership of this individual will be
strong, dynamic and progressive, and he will bear a reverence for
divine manifestations.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of uncommon personal and
professional brilliance, dignified, awe-inspiring and deep think-
ing. He will be in a high position, and influential in revitalizing
the spirit and enthusiasm of the nation. He will establish great
merit, and his life will be rich and rewarding.
Least auspicious: He also will be aware of the pitfalls of life, as
they relate to the nation, to corporate enterprises, and to his own
personal affairs, and he will be able to make the necessary correc-
tions when needed. He will have hardships early in life, but things
will gradually smoooth out later.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will have a surprise, or an un-
                                expected turn of events, with much
                                joy later.
   Business and professional There is the possibility of becoming
                                well-known as the result of a
                                sudden development or occurrence.
   .Ordinary people             There is the possibility of some-
                                thing alarming occurring early in
                                the year, with an occasion for
                                celebration later.
 Line z Thunder approaches. He relinquishes his valuables and
 ascends the nine hills. He should not search for them. In seven
 days he will regain them.

It is as if the thunder has left a flood in its wake and one has to
flee, leaving one's possessions and valuables behind, while one
ascends some high hills away from danger. But there is no need
for alarm. One will regain the valuables in time, and there is no
need to go in pursuit of them. The words 'seven days' represent a
cycle of events based on this hexagram. In the process of renewal
many strange seeming events take place, which are a reaction to
the new attitudes being generated. One must not resist or fight
evil coming to the fore, but flee to safety, since evil gains strength
from being resisted. When a man has fully renewed himself, i.e.
at the completion of the cycle, he will regain all his losses and
                                               3 / The Predictions
much more besides. Persons capable of achieving this are un-
usually gifted.
Most auspicious: He will have great innate intelligence and
wisdom, and will follow the golden mean. He will plan ahead and
avoid many troubles, and he will be a capable negotiator and
mediator. He will not start a new enterprise, but will materially
assist in promoting and elevating an existing one. He will be
amply rewarded.
Least auspicious: He will not possess foresight and will often be
encompassed by dangers which could have been avoided. He will
also be greedy, which will add to his difficulties. He will be a
wanderer and philanderer, and his life will be full of worries.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He will experience troubles through
                              cunning officials and associates.
   Business and professional He will be perplexed much of the
                              time, with gains towards the end of
                              the year.
   Ordinary people            He will have disputes and troubles
                              which will clear up satisfactorily
                              later.
Line}     Thunderfrightens. If he is excitedinto action, no mistakes.

The third line is the 'lower line of man' in any hexagram, and is
often considered the representative of the COmmonman. (Lines
5 and 6 represent heaven, lines 3 and 4, man, and lines 1 and 2,
the earth.) Hence the dilemma of the ordinary man is here shown,
regarding his self-development. He is awestruck and fearful of
the wonderful manifestations ofthe divine, which he is beginning
to understand. If these inspire him, and stir him to try and make
further progress, then he will slowly advance and make no grave
mistakes. These persons are beginning to become aware of the
laws of nature, and of how to apply them in the world of man.
Most auspicious: He will be an intelligent and cautious indi-
vidual, advancing modestly and safely. He will not forget the
possibility of danger in times of safety, or of disorder in times of
peace. He will not be single-minded, and so will not accomplish
anything very great. He will, however, lead a moral, virtuous
life, meeting his commitments, and having a modest yet con-
tented existence.
3   I   The Predictions
Least auspicious: He will be intelligent but very timid, which
will result in an unstable life, with no accomplishments and only
minimal reward.
In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official            He will be blamed for the inactivity
                                of those under him.

   Business and professional He will tend to do only that which
                                 is demanded of him.
   Ordinary people               A year for caution. Troubles, dis-
                                 putes and lawsuits are imminent.
Line 4 Thunder descends into the mud.

This Yang line, with a pair of Yin lines on either side of it (in
part forming the nuclear trigram K'an, danger, water), symbol-
izes the thunder sinking into the mud. It is as if a man is sur-
rounded by sensuality and desire (Yin lines are female) and lets
himself be overcome by them. In another sense, it indicates that
the mind is inert and cannot see clearly the things which would
help it. These things keep this person from having the auspicious
life, position and accomplishments that one born under the
fourth line can normally expect.
Most auspicious: Unless he proceeds slowly and carefully he
will frequently let his personal wishes and desires override his
good judgment, even though he will know how to control them.
He will gradually lessen his faults by striving to improve himself.
He will not have a business of his own, but he will prove useful to
others, will keep out of trouble, and will have a moderately com-
fortable life.
Least auspicious: He will not rise to a very high position, and
will live in poor surroundings. He occasionally will make an effort
to improve himself, but in general he will have a miserable life.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official         He will be dismissed or demoted.
    Business and professional He will encounter a depression or
                                retrogression in his affairs.
    Ordinary people             An unstable year. He will find him-
                                self without support. The less
                                auspicious may be jailed.
 Line 5 Going hither and thither amid thunder. Danger.
 Exercising care will avert loss, yet things need to be done.
                                               5   I   The Prediaions
The difficulties of self-improvement without a guide are truly
great. There are many times when one is perplexed as to the best
direction in which to proceed. This man is in the position of the
ruler or leader (line 5), but even so, auspiciousness is not pre-
saged. It is true, however, that exercising care will avert losses or
retrogressions. In such cirumstances it is highly desirable to have
a firm goal. These persons will, generally speaking, try to do their
best with what they have.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of high morals and virtue,
but will not be highly qualified professionally unless guided. He
will be of benefit, to an average degree, in whatever enterprises
he is associated with. His home life, too, will be averagely bene-
ficial.
Least auspicious: He also will be an honest person, wandering
in his early years, and travelling considerably all his life. Matters
will turn out quite favorably in his later years.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will keep his present position.
   Business and professional Business will be as usual, with little
                                fluctuation.
   Ordinary people              He will have many worries.
Line 6 Thunder brings devastation. People gaze with appre-
hension and terror. Advancing brings misfortune. If it has not
affected us but only our neighbors, no error. Like with a marriage,
there is cause for comment.

Those depicted here will misguidedly try to emulate great spiritual
leaders, martyrs, or leaders in the material world, without having
the necessary development or qualifications. They will believe
that they can absorb some of the greatness through physical
imitation of actions or appearances, rather than strive consistently
to achieve the same mental or spiritual qualities. Religion of one
sort or another is invariably associated with such actions. Their
lives will be so unusual that they will become the source of much
comment. However, if one strives to emulate greatness in the
right way, no error will result, regardless of what one's neighbors
or others may do.
Most auspicious: He will constantly strive for improvement in
his personal development. He will take precautions against possible
calamities, and will nip troubles in the bud. His character and

                                                                  555
5    I   The Predictions
dignity will earn the respect of his neighbors. His family life will
be modest but good.
Least auspicious: He will be self-centered, egotistical and mis-
guided. His only concern will be himself, and he will have little
or no regard for others. He will be a disturbing influence where-
ever he is, and if married will have much family discord.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will face the possibility of de-
                               motion for erroneous blame.
   Business and professional There will be a decline in his
                               enterprise, or diminished results.
   Ordinary people             Only with extreme caution can
                               troubles be avoided.

KEYNOTES
1.   The inner self must be developed, as well as the external self.
2.   New thoughts will produce new conditions if implemented.
5.   Too rapid progress is dangerous.
4.   Eliminate fears and erroneous desires, one at a time.
5.   Perplexities are to be expected during any self-development.
6.   Never overdo anything, even self-development.

CONDENSATIONS              FOR   DAILY   CYCLES
1. Some unusual thought or event will occur, which may spur
you to either change or revitalize something.
2. There is evil at hand, and you may suffer a loss. Do not try to
force its return. Later you will regain your losses.
5. Are you being lethargic? Search for new opportunities, or take
corrective measures as necessary.
4. You will be inert or muddled in your thinking today.
5. Repeated dangers often threaten one's activity, but if you
devote care and consideration to your work, no loss will be oc-
casioned.
6. Remain calm today, even if things seem dire. Any action you
take may only make matters worse.

Hexagram     52   Ken   ==   Keeping Still (Mountain)


SIMPLE     TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
Keeping the back still, so that he is insensitive. Walking in the
courtyard without seeing people. No error.

COMMENTARY
The hexagram is the trigram Ken, mountain, doubled, which
bespeaks a stillness, calmness and imperturbability. The spinal
column is the center of the nervous system. When it is so calm as
to be insensitive the individual has attained a state of perfection
where the body is of no great consequence other than to be a
vehicle. When one's eyes notice no one, one has an inner security
from which fears and vanity have been eliminated. Vanity is the
hardest of all traits to be free from. These persons have the
potential to become persons of such a free nature, and the con-
trolling lines provide guidance for such development. In the end
one can rise to the grandeur of a mountain. Keeping still does not
mean inactivity. Rather it is the taking of propitious actions at the
right time, and using the expedient of tranquility to attain free-
dom from selfish thoughts and yearnings, when appropriate. No
 errors are committed when one has fully attained this free-
dom.
   Those born in the fourth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line I Keeping the toes still. No blame. Firm correctness ad-
vantageous.

As in other hexagrams, this lowest line symbolizes the toes, in
which originate physical progress forward by a man. This line is
the base of both mountains, and therefore represents firmness and
immobility. Hence these persons should be firm, and anxious to
do what is right at all times. At the beginning of matters they will
usually be quite unsullied by external influences. If they maintain
firm correctness, the right direction to proceed will become known
when needed, and progress can be made. Knowledgeable and
just, yet cautious and conservative individuals are depicted here.

                                                                   557
3   I   The Predictions
Most auspicious: He will follow the golden mean, and will there-
fore be free from the harms that attend following an evil path.
His conservatism will keep him from rising high or making great
gains, but he will have a personally satisfying and easy life, with
no major troubles.
Least auspicious: He also will be modest and sincere, but not as
knowledgeable as the most auspicious. He will have a good family,
and a humble life, with no major difficulties.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        There will be no mistakes this
                              year.
   Business and professional An average year, without much
                              progress.
   Ordinary people            He will be contented with his
                              existence, and free from envy or
                              harmful desires; hence he will
                              avoid troubles.
Line 2 Keeping the calves still. He cannot help whom he follows.
He is not happy.

The calves are not an independent part of the body, nor do they
control movement. This man must follow a stronger leader. Since
line 2 is a Yin line in its proper place, he will try to do what is
right and just, and try to halt if on a path of wrongdoing. As he is
not in control he will be unable to help the one above him (line
3). For the most part these persons will pick the wrong careers,
 and consequently will hamper their own progress somewhat, while
being relatively ineffective in the helping of, and rendering
service to, others.
Most auspicious: He will be talented and ambitious, but will be
in the wrong situations to be truly effective. His personal charac-
ter will improve through the conquest of obstacles, but as he is
impeded in helping others he will not rise high. He will work
diligently for what is right, and his reputation will become favor-
able after his death.
Least auspicious: He will be quite knowledgeable and have a
good character, but will be timid, shy and wavering. Conse-
quently, his achievements will be quite limited, professionally
and with regard to his family and himself. Regrettably, he will be
an inveterate worrier.
                                                3   I The Predictions
In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official           Routine matters will be satisfac-
                               torily handled, but he will be inept
                               in emergencies.
   Business and professional New ideas will not be accepted this
                               year.
   Ordinary people              Desires, in general, will not be ac-
                               complished, and gains will not be
                                made. He may also have leg
                               trouble, or family difficulties.
Line J Keeping the loins still. No movement of the pelvis.
Perilous. His heart suffocates.

This is the top line of the first mountain, but held still by the base
of the mountain above it. This is a perilous position, and many
talents and worthy attributes are seemingly immobilized by virtue
of the situation. If one tries to use force before the situation be-
comes pliant, irritation, dissatisfaction and danger will result. This
is a time for preparation and development, in both personal and
external affairs. One should avoid artificiality and insincerity,
and let things develop naturally. Calmness must come from with-
in. One should also be cautious regarding the enforcement of
stillness before one is ready for it.
Most auspicious: He will be quite wise and will eventually be
assigned to a high position. But if he is envious and greedy, he
will be unable to exercise a stabilizing influence and help keep
good people in office. He is then likely to be blamed severely for
not being adequate to the demands of his position.
Least auspicious: He is likely to be a man of considerable means,
using his assets for selfish or evil purposes, which will result in
great difficulties and a troublesome life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official            He will probably be transferred.
   Business and professional His written efforts will be quite
                                  effective.

and heart) is still, one achieves a calmness of spirit and the

elimination of impulsive and egoistic drives. When this has been
achieved one becomes free from error. It is a worthy goal to strive
for, but few are the persons who can truly achieve it. They will be
individuals of noble character, full of wisdom and confidence,
who think, speak and act in a cool, calm and deliberate manner.
Most auspicious: He will be knowledgeable, sincere, stable and
composed, but a man whose value will be recognized only to a
very limited degree. He will not be in a position to be valuable to
his nation, but he will be a pillar of strength in his enterprise. He
will be highly respected for his dignity and virtue, and will have
a good, modest life.
Least auspicious: He also will have a good character, but his
main interests will be his own goals. He may become a monk or a
priest.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He should stay in his present posi-
                                tion, and try not to change.
   Business and professional Use proven methods only. Trying
                                to advance matters surreptitiously
                                will result in failure.
   Ordinary people              Keep within duly circumscribed
                                limits and things will go well.
Line 5 Keeping the jaws still. His words are well ordered. Cause
for regret disappears.

All great leaders have quick, clear and incisive minds, and the
ability to communicate readily with others. By not indulging in
idle chatter, and speaking only when one has something worth-
while to say, using only well chosen words, one's communication
is highly effective and every occasion for regret disappears. Not
only can the influence of these persons be great, but their personal
development will be considerably enhanced as well.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of knowledge, wisdom and
experience, who can speak effectively for the ruler of his country
and its people. He can also be a valuable advisor. His own life will
be higWy favorable in all aspects.
Least auspicious: He will be a person who communicates and in-
fluences others through singing, acting, public speaking, etc. He
will be gifted at telling stories. He will be helped considerably by
friends or relatives, and will have modest success,                .

                             smoothly. The less auspicious may
                             have oral disputes.
Line 6 Keeping still eminently. Good fortune.

This line is the ruler of the hexagram, and signifies persons who
have achieved an inner development of an exceptionally high
order. Their tranquility and acceptance of divine manifestations
results in singular blessings, wherever they are and irrespective
of their pursuits. They possess the majestic dignity and towering
strength of a mountain. Their lives will be peaceful and they will
be at ease regardless of circumstances. They will bring benefits to
all matters in which they engage.
Most auspicious: He will be a tranquil man of noble character,
dignified and respected, and full of wisdom. He will lead an

Hexagram 5J          Chien    ==     Gradual Development (Progress)


SIMPLE        TRANSLATION         OF TEXT
Gradual Development. The marriage of a maiden. Good fortune.
Firm correctness brings rewards.

COMMENTARY
The hexagram is composed of the trigram Sun, wood, above Ken,
mountain. A tree (Sun) grows slowly. Likewise, the preparations
for the marriage of a maiden, according to Chinese custom, pro-
ceed gradually, with due deliberation and consideration. If these
are carried out fully and correctly, good fortune results. In this
hexagram, progress leads to a commanding position, i.e. a tree on
the top of a mountain, visible for a great distance. The symbolism
of the lines concerns the wild goose, which according to Chinese
legend flies towards the sun. In the Western hemisphere one
could find a parallel in the snow goose, which often flies to the
mountains from out at sea. These persons will acquire ever in-
creasing knowledge, influence and power, especially if a path of
self-development is undertaken.
   Those born in the first month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING           LINES      (FROM   BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line I The wild goose gradually approaches the shore. The
young son is in danger. There is talk, but no error.

                                                :5 / The Predictions
This line is a weak line in a strong place, and without a proper
correlate. Being thus alone is dangerous, just as if a young son
were to try to make his way alone in life. In flying towards the
shore it is necessary for the goose to pick out landmarks and orient
itself before doing anything else. This is a position of initial doubt
and uncertainty, which will cause talk, but no grave errors will be
made if this person keeps his long term goals constantly in mind,
and devotes his efforts to achieving them.
Most auspicious: He will be clever, talented and virtuous. Early in
his career he will enter a position of leadership, and will continue
to make gradual progress. He will be alert for opportunities, but
will never act in haste. He will always be progressive in his think-
ing and deliberate in his actions. Destiny will favor him with a
rich and rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will have many hardships early in life, hut
will make slow, steady progress. He will establish himself, per·
sonally and professionally, late in life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He will be involved adversely in
                                internal and external politics.
   Business and professional Changes in rules and requirements
                                will limit results.
   Ordinary people               There will be many difficulties
                                early in the year, with matters eas-
                                ing off later.
Line 2 The wild goose gradually approaches the cliffs. Eating
and drinking sociably. Good fortune.

The second line is the position of an official, and as line 2 is here a
Yin line in its proper place he will receive the support of the
strong ruler (line 5). This line depicts a person who has found a
safe place in which to live, with plenty to eat and drink. In the
material world, most gains are achieved in a setting of con-
viviality. The wild goose is said to share its good fortune, and a
man likewise will benefit from sharing his. One must give in
order to receive, and the value of sociability as a means of giving
and receiving is well established.
Most auspicious: He will be in a high position, supporting the
nation and its ruler, and helping to stabilize conditions and bring
about improvements. His efforts will be effective, and he will be
j




    :5   I   The Predictions
    respected at all levels and duly rewarded. He will have an interest-
    ing and highly satisfactory life in all respects.
    Least auspicious: He also will be a leader in an influential position,
    with ample means, and enjoying a generally easy life. Later he
    may live in seclusion or travel abroad considerably.
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official           A very good year.
       Business and professional He will make considerable gains.
       Ordinary people               A year of contentment, with plenty
                                     of money and good food.
    Line)     The wild goose gradually approaches the plateau. The
    husband goes forth and does not return. The wife is pregnant, but
    does not nourish the child. Misfortune. Resisting plunderers is
    advantageous.

    Here, as in some other hexagrams, line 3 is a strong line without
    a proper con-elate. This signifies that this person is in a difficult
    position, as the goose would be, if lost on an arid plateau. The
    next two statements imply that he is like a husband who does not
    care for his wife, or like a wife who does not care for her child.
    These both are conditions that lead to misfortune. This man will
    have a tendency to act alone, to try to force the culmination of
    projects and activities, and to be reckless in his efforts at advance-
    ment. If he is wise he will see these potential pitfalls and avoid
    them. He is also likely to be subjected to unjustified accusations,
    and he will have to defend his position frequently, through right
    words and actions.
    Most auspicious: He will be courageous and erudite, and, with
    experience, will be able to contribute much of benefit to his
    country and to the world. He will have ample material means, but
    will meet with opposition professionally and will face trouble
    with his wife at home.
    Least auspicious: He will enter a career where travelling and
    being away from home much of the time are involved. He will
    not be noted for his sociability, and he may separate from his wife
    and children. He will not have a desirable life.
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official           He may be blamed erroneously, or
                                     else demoted.

                                              5 / The Predictions
  Ordinary people            The year will lack in harmony and
                             cooperation. He may be robbed, or
                             suffer a heavy loss.
Line 4 The wild goose gradually approaches the tree. There he
may land on a branch. No error.

The upper trigram is symbolized by the tree, and the goose has
now arrived there. Since the goose's feet are flat it will have much
difficulty in trying to perch on a branch. The lesson to be drawn
is that this man must be sprightly and nimble, but even so he will
be subject to danger. This trigram also represents humility, so if
he can combine humility with these other traits there will be no
error. A weak fourth line does not suggest auspiciousness, but
these individuals will be able to develop themselves, personally
and professionally, so that they can render valuable service for the
benefit of many.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of exemplary morals and
strength of character. He will be well qualified, and in a high
position. He will make an excellent diplomat or negotiator. He
will achieve much merit, and will have a good, satisfying and
uncomplicated life.
Least auspicious: He will find it hard early in life to make a
living and. to establish himself. By being circumspect reverent
and frugal, he will gradually improve himself and his life, and in
later years he will reap the rewards of his diligent and persistent
efforts.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official         Many matters will be in a state of
                                delicate balance, but if correct
                                methods are followed they will end
                                favorably.
    Business and professional He will not start having any real
                                success until late in the year.
    Ordinary people             He will have ample funds and few
                                worries. A good year to build or

 Line 5 The wild goose gradually approaches the summit. The
woman does not become pregnant for three years, but in the end
it cannot be prevented. Good fortune.
5   I   The Predictions
Having a child and heir is symbolic of achieving one's desires. The
summit is a high place, and as one approaches high positions in life
one often meets with envy, slanders, malicious gossip and opposi-
tion. It is only by having firm goals and concentrating on them
perspicaciously, and by making oneself worthy of the higher
                                                                        I.
position, that one can achieve it. This man will have the qualities
and character necessary to attain his aims and purposes, but they
will only materialize later in life, after much diligent persistence.
Most auspicious: In his youth he will be exuberant, ambitious,
energetic and relentless in pursuit of his desires and goals. He will
be ready to set the world on fire. After much experience, which
he will refine into wisdom, he will achieve his purposes and be
highly successful, personally and professionally.
Least auspicious: He will choose the path of devotion to self-
development, rather than work for the improvement of others.
He will possess, or will attain, modest means, and will later live a
secluded life. He may marry late in life, but will have few chil-
dren.

   Ordinary people               Those born in the first month will
                                 be very auspicious. Otherwise, a

 Line 6 The wild goose advances beyond the summit. Its
feathers can be used in the sacred rituals. Good fortune.

These are persons who will become intellectual leaders, as their
mentality will be developed beyond the material realm. They will
be noted writers, orators, educators, spiritual leaders, and eminent
artists, etc., who give of themselves for the benefit of others. The
sacred rituals in ancient China were a means of reminding persons
to perform their duties and follow the right paths for progress in

or lesser) benefit to mankind.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of noble character and great
virtue, with a magnificent ability to communicate. He will have a
deep love for people, and will be respected by them in turn. His
work will be of great benefit to mankind. He will have a good life,
with many friends and ample wealth.
Least auspicious: He will not be concerned about fame or for-
tune. He will live a secluded life, or become a monk or priest and
work for the benefit of mankind in that way. He will be benefi-
cent but will have no wealth.

Hexagram 54      Kuei Mei          The Marrying Maidim.

SIMPLE    TRANSLATION       OF    TEXT
The Marrying Maiden. Enterprises bring misfortune. Attempted
progress disadvantageous.

COMMENTARY
The hexagram is composed of the eldest son, Chen, leading the
youngest daughter, Tui. This is unfavorable in two ways, firstly
because of the wide disparity between the ages of the partners in
the marriage, and secondly, because the bride comes to the
groom's home, rather than he coming to her home. Hence, the
omens for the hexagram are not very good. As is well appreciated,
situations are often not what they seem, and that is true in this
case. There will be frequent miscalculations and misrepresenta-
tions. Extreme caution is recommended, especially at the begin-
ning of anything new. Those depicted here will be enthusiastic,
and would like to be progressive. However, circumstances will
circumscribe their potential and their usefulness. The inner
hexagram shows that matters, on the whole, have already reached
a state of completion, and that advancing further would bring
about a state of decline rather than progress. Due circumspection
can result in a satisfying life.
   Those born in the seventh month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM   TO TOP)
Line I The marrying maiden becomes a concubine. A lame man
can still walk. Advancing portends good fortune.

Line 1, although a strong line in the right place, is held back by
the strength of Yang lines 2 and 4. Thus its effectiveness is
likened to a concubine who serves as a secondary wife, and to a
lame man, who can still walk but not as effectively as others.
Hence these persons will be limited by external conditions beyond
their control, e.g. the situation into which they were born,
obligations they must fulfil to their families or to creditors, or
contractual commitments. A desire to serve and to rise in the
world will be there, but only a few will break through and over-
come the limitations that bind them.

    Most auspicious: He will be quite well educated and virtuous,
    but he will not have the opportunities to demonstrate his abilities
    or his usefulness. He will follow matters through to completion,
    but will receive no help or support from outside. He will have
    only small accomplishments in life.
    Least auspicious: He also will carry undertakings through to
    completion, and will finish everything he begins, but he will have
    severe hardships and impediments along the way.
    In yearly hexagram:

                                   gains.
       Ordinary people             He will lead a useful existence and
                                   make small gains. He may receive
                                   help from an influential person.
    Line 2 A one-eyed man can see. The firm correctness of a recluse
    advantageous.

    Unflinching loyalty and singleness of purpose are symbolized here.
    It is like a widow who resists all further offers of marriage, pre-
    ferring to die rather than be disloyal to her late husband. A one-



I
    eyed man can see and can concentrate on one thing at a time, but
    has no depth perception. Ancillary matters will not be properly
    taken care of by these persons, and therefore they will not rise
    high. This is because this is a strong line in a weak place, and
    supported by a weak line 5. A break-through from these limita-
    tions can be made if appropriate partners and associates are found.
    Most auspicious: He will cultivate himself, personally and pro-
    fessionally, but his personality will limit his effectiveness. He will
    be ambitious and will work diligently. He will be faithful and true
    to all his commitments, and will have a comfortable life, despite
    not rising very high by worldly standards. He will be respected by
    his family and by others as well.
    Least auspicious: He also will have sufficient, or even abundant,
    means, and consequently will have a reasonable standard of living.
    He will be of benefit to others, but never to the extent of receiving
    acclaim or a great reputation.
    5   I   The Predictions
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official       There will be no change in his cir-
                                 cumstances.
       Business and professional As above.
       Ordinary people           He will find contentment and have
                                 no troubles, if he follows established
                                 patterns and methods.
    Line J The marrying maiden in servitude. She returns and
    becomes a concubine.

    Line 5 is weak where it should be strong, and at the top of the
    trigram Tui, joy, but without a proper correlate. Therefore, this
    person will have a tendency to seek and to obtain pleasure in other
    than right and honorable ways. The result is that the maiden will
    not have the right background to become the principal wife, but
    with a change in her ways she may find a position as a concubine.
    Sensuality and sexuality will tend to hold sway over this person's
    life. He will have many periods of irritability, as well as fleeting
    periods of pleasure and joy. Without proper associates and goals,
    little progress, if any, will be made.
    Most auspicious: He will have limited talent, will be modestly
    well educated, and will possess a knowledge of, and training in,
    virtue, but he will have an effete conscience. He will be able to
    accomplish small things with much effort, but all attempts towards
    major accomplishments will be blocked.
    Least auspicious: He will have erroneous ideas, and will direct his
    energies towards the wrong goals. Fortune will not favor him. He
    may have to be supported by a rich wife or another wealthy per-
    son. He will have a difficult life.
    In yearly hexagram:
        Officer or official          He will be dismissed or demoted.
        Business and professional He will have difficulty in maintain-
                                     ing his status.
        Ordinary people              He will have many hardships, and
                                     may be involved in a publicized
                                     illicit affair, or divorced.

     eventually she is wed.

what is required of them while waiting for their aims to material-
ize. They will never use improper methods, preferring always to
be honest, forthright and trustworthy. They will be calm and
patient, but by no means placid. They will be constantly involved
in improving themselves, personally and professionally, and will
know where they want to go.
Most auspicious: He will be a knowledgeable person of high
intelligence, who follows proper methods and the golden mean.
His development in early life will be slow, but in his later years
his goals will be fulfilled and he will have a very favorable exist-
ence in all respects.
Least auspicious: He will be quite well educated, but will only
have modest talents. He will encounter numerous impediments
and difficulties. He will probably marry or have children, late in
life. His life will become easier in his later years.
In yearly hexagram:
   For everyone Difficulties at the beginning of the year will
                     smooth out later. Be calm, and exercise patience.
                     Matters will work out propitiously. Those seek-
                     ing marriage will probably not be successful.
Line 5 The emperor's younger sister wore garments at her
wedding less regal than her bridesmaid's. The moon is nearly full.
There will be good fortune.

The subordination of characteristics and abilities is sometimes
necessary in order to achieve one's aims and purposes. However,
once such a course has been decided upon, it is vital to carry it
through precisely. One will not be eclipsed by so doing, and in the
end good fortune will arise, both for oneself and for what one is
endeavoring to accomplish. Only knowledgeable and wise persons
with strong characters can successfully act in this manner.
Most auspicious: He will have great innate intelligence, wisdom
and strength, together with virtue and broad-mindedness. He
will follow such courses as are known to be successful, and he will
be free from vanity. He ",'ill accomplish many worthwhile
projects, and will receive fame and rewards. His life will be
highly favored in all respects.
Least auspicious: He will be similar to the most auspicious, but
not as daring, nor will his accomplishments be of such great scope
or value. He will be modest and frugal, and will have a good life.
    3 , The Predictions
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official      He can expect promotion.
       Business and professionalHe can expect an increased reputa-
                                tion and profits.
       Ordinary people          He will experience an exceptionally
                                joyful event. Strong desires will be
                                fulfilled. He may make money
                                through his marriage.
    Line 6 A woman holds a basket, but there is nothing in it. A
    man slaughters a sheep, but no blood flows. Nothing favorable
    now.

    The marriage contract is broken, and the man and the woman
    both go to the temple to offer a sacrifice. However, there is
    evidently great insincerity, as the offerings are a pretence, i.e, an
    empty basket and a sheep that is already dead. The right attitude
    and correct attributes are not available for union, unless this per-
    son undergoes a change of character. These persons have certain


I
    lessons to learn, including that of trying to find satisfaction where-
    ever they are, since fate prevents them from accomplishing any-
    thing great.
    Most auspicious: Although he will have many talents he will
    gain neither high position nor fame. Although he will be noble
    his salary will not be of comparable stature. He will marry, but
    will have few children.
    Least auspicious: He will have many periods of solitude and
    many hardships in life. The more he tries in the external world,
    the worse he will fail, until he changes inwardly.
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official           He will have a position in title, but
                                    with no real power; his salary will
                                    be limited.
       Business and professional His previous favorable reputation
                                    will have little or no value this
                                    year.
       Ordinary people               He will find no satisfaction in his
                                     accomplishments; they will seem
                                    empty once concluded. Older per-
                                    sons may die.

necessary, but not ingratiating.
6. Your thoughts are likely to be insincere today. Do not act.


Hexagram     55   Feng   ==   Abundance


SIMPLE     TRANSLATION     OF TEXT
Abundance. Success. The king has attained abundance. Be not
sad. Be like the sun at noon.

COMMENTARY
The trigram Chen, movement, is above, and leading the trigram
Li, clarity, below and within. This combination is bound to pro-
duce abundance. This abundance can be for good or for bad,
depending on how it is obtained and the attitude associated with
it. Every rise is followed by a decline, according to the law of
change (unless something new is injected to replace the old). One
should not be sad, since every day and every cycle of events serves
its intended purpose. One should maintain an attitude like the sun
at its zenith, cheering, sustaining and helping to enlighten all.

                                                                373
sI    The Predictions
One's individual position, given by the controlling line, is im-
portant, since this determines one's relationship to the abundance
and its nature. All persons born under this hexagram will have
good minds and will tend to be active and energetic, irrespec-
t.ivn of their circumstances. All will strive to perpetuate ahund-
ance,
    Those born in the ninth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line I A man meets his destined partner. Though they be
together for ten days, no error. Progress meets with approval.

Here, because of the nature of the hexagram, i.e, clarity com-
bined with action, we have an exception to the normal rule
regarding line correlates, and even though lines 1 and 4 are both
strong, they are said to be destined for each other. Therefore,
even though they may work together for a complete cycle of
activity, signified by the expression 'ten days,' there will be no
error; the progress made will meet with approval. Wisdom is
being supported and helped by appropriate action. The persons
depicted here will have characteristics and abilities that are
recognized by their superiors. They will receive help and support
from those above them, as if being specially favored or tutored.
This help will be very beneficial if properly accepted.
Most auspicious: He will be talented, magnanimous, wise and
just, and living in a period of prosperity. He will be drawn to, and
work with, persons of like mind, character and ability, and will
achieve major accomplishments. He will have a good and benefi-
ciallife.
Least auspicious: He will know that his talents and abilities are
above average, but he will become arrogant and selfish. He will
disdain help when proffered, and will frequently have disputes
with others. He will have an unhappy life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He will be brought into contact
                                 with a high superior, who will
                                 enable him to be promoted.
   Business and professional He will come into contact with
                                good peers and associates, and he
                                will gain fame and profits.

Line 2 The curtain is so denpe that the pole-star can be seen at
noon. His advancing now will be viewed with suspicion and dis-
trust. Through sincerity, confiJ.ence is regained. Good fortune.

 Men of clarity, vision and ampition are depicted here, but their
 fate is to be subjugated. by jetllous or envious leaders. It is only
 through long, diligent, ofter' frustrating, and single-minded
 effort, carried out with absolute sincerity, that they can eventually
 overcome fate and rise to a le~el appropriate for their character
 and ability.

rules and regulations, and to be under those who deliberately or
unknowingly fail to see their potential. They will also often fail
to communicate properly, and their intentions will thus be mis-

 understood. These persons almost never rise far above these
conditions. It is as if they are perpetually functioning with a
broken arm.
Most auspicious: He will be knowledgeable, clear thinking and
honorable, but will be placed under muddle-headed leaders. Any
 effort towards major gains in status or conditions will be thwarted
 and obstructed by leaders and colleagues. He will have no major
 accomplishments.
Least auspicious: He will have ability but will use it thought-
lessly, thereby harming himself professionally and frequently
 hurting the feelings of his family. He will make a few successful
but small gains. In general, his life will be unsatisfactory.
'In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official         He will be retired, or should
                                consider retiring.
    Business and professional He will make great efforts but will
                                achieve very little progress.
    Ordinary people             Obtaining one's goals will be
                                difficult. He may have trouble
                                with his hands and/or feet.
 Line 4 The curtain is so dense that the pole-star can be seen at
 noon. He meets his partner of like kind. Good fortune.

Lines 1 and 4 are proper correlates in this hexagram (see
commentary under Line 1) and join their forces together. This is
a union of clarity and action and is very propitious, even though
it will frequently act independently of the ruler. Since guide
lines are correctly followed, there will be good fortune. Such
independence needs to be frequently exercised by persons working
for muddled or inadequately qualified leaders. Those depicted
here will have the ability and attributes necessary for success in
such a course of action. On the whole, they will be men of action,
supported by the wisdom of others.
Most auspicious: He will have a bright and constant virtue,
which will shine forth, as through a veil, like a gentle light.
His thoughts, ideas and actions will all be meritable, but he will
always need the support and help of others to bring them to

fruition. In this manner he will have many worthwhile achieve-
ments, for which he will be duly rewarded. His family life will
be enviable, with much cooperation between all the members.
Least auspicious: He will leave his family and their enterprises
to establish himself on his own merit, but will find that he needs
cooperation from others, which will be difficult for him to obtain.
He will have many herdships at first, with things becoming
smoother later. He is likely to be involved in financial matters in
his career.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         The leader will be jealous and
                               suspicious. Not a good year.

                               may have difficulties on a journey.
 Line 5 Men of brilliant ability appear. Blessings and fame come
 forth. Good fortune.

Here the unusualness of this hexagram is again depicted, in that
line 5, the ruler, although weak, has not only the strong support
of the minister, line 4, but that of the complete lower trigram as
well. These latter lines are the 'men of brilliant ability.'
Combined, their actions presage blessings and fame. The persons
depicted here will have a natural propensity to surround them-
selves with intelligent and brilliant people. They will, of course,
be highly qualified themselves, as well as being natural leaders.
In this way great accomplishments can result.
Most auspicious: He will be a well-educated man, with great
common sense and a noble character, rising from relatively
obscure status to become a man of renown. He will eventually be
in an important position, and responsible for many beneficial
 accomplishments. He will have a well-earned, favorable re-
 putation, and a good life in all aspects.
 Least auspicious: His life will be similar to that of the most
 auspicious, but on a much smaller scale.

Misfortune.

Here, at the top of the hexagram, the value of abundance is
rapidly waning. It is like trying to keep up a castle or a mansion
when times have changed and they are no longer appropriate.
These persons will have a misguided sense of values, and will
try to hang on to the past instead of keeping up to date. The
harder they try the worse they will fail, and they will become
isolated from their own families for long periods of time. They
will even misinterpret and misuse their education and experience.
There will be but little hope for them.
Most auspicious: He may inherit an ancestral estate or property,
but will not have the ability to keep it. He will be helped
occasionally, but will not benefit by it, and he will later become
isolated through arrogance. He will always believe himself to be
in the right, and will act rashly. He will not reform, and his
life will end in disaster.
Least auspicious: He will be talented, but will become so
arrogant that he isolates himself from his relatives and friends.
He will vacillate in his occupations, and will experience many
difficulties in all phases of his life.

Hexagram 56        t.a   ==     The Traveller


SIMPLE      TRANSLATION         OF TEXT
The Traveller. Small success and progress. Firm correctness
brings good fortune.

COMMENTARY
The hexagram represents fire, the trigram Li, on the mountain,
the trigram Ken, hence the idea of something or someone that
travels. Since fire on a mountain can be seen over great distances,
those depicted here will be persons of importance whose actions
carry weight and influence, but, just like fire, they will shift and
stray from one place to another. What is important is the clarity
with which they can handle matters. This will be particularly
true in situations that should be handled quickly, wisely and
effectively, such as disputes, lawsuits and disciplinary matters.
As Hsun Tzu, an ancient Chinese philosopher said, in essence,
about travellers: one should select only the proper means of
conveyance, go to proper communities, seek out only the proper
scholars and officials, and stay away from the heretical and
depraved. In the lines of the hexagram one is shown how to

                                                                 579
5 / The Predictions
comport oneself under various circumstances. Since action does
not play a dominant part in either trigram, only small successes
are presaged. The advice given here can be used by anyone whose
life and work involve travelling. Furthermore, stability within
and clarity without are desirable traits in any circumstances; and
these are the dominant traits of those persons born under this
hexagram.
   Those born in the fifth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING      LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line   I If the traveller engages in trivial matters, he brings
misfortune upon himself.

Deporting himself in an undignified manner, and at the same
time dealing only in inferior matters, creates disdain for the
travelling stranger, and he draws misfortune down upon himself.
This also applies to those who treat life scornfully and playfully,
no matter where they are. As far as possible one should try to
follow the manners and customs of the country one is in. This
respect for manners applies to other situations as well.
Most auspicious: He may be quite knowledgeable, but will be
able to attain small positions only. This will be due to his lack of
conformity. He will be in difficulties frequently because of
diffidence. He will not establish merit for himself, at home or in
his profession.
Least auspicious: He will start life in poor and appalling con-
ditions. Through education he will improve his lot, but as soon
as things start to go well he will become arrogant and high-
handed, and he will lose what he has gained. He will be greatly
distressed about his adverse conditions, but will never realize
that he must change inwardly. Eventually he will give up
struggling and will succumb to calamity.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will regret his insufficient
                               talent for handling his work.
   Business and professional He will act parsimoniously and will
                               encounter losses.
   Ordinary people              He will tend to be very narrow-
                               minded, and limited in his activity,
                               resulting in adverse conditions.
                                               5   I   The Predictions
Line 2 The traveller arrives at an inn. He has his resources
with him. He gains the loyalty of a young servant.

Line 2 is a Yin line in its proper position, and so depicts a
traveller who is at a safe and proper place. He has had a safe
journey and still possesses his resources. As he is dignified,
modest and reserved, he wins the loyalty of a young servant. All
in all, the traveller has everything he requires. Only able, far-
sighted, wise, practical and courageous persons can achieve such
a circumstance.
Most auspicious: He will be in a high position, involving national
and international activity. He will love people and will take an
interest in them. He will work for, and obtain many benefits for,
others. His accomplishments will be a blessing to all people
everywhere. He will be supported and respected by many, and
will have a rich, fruitful and rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will be in a high civilian position, and will
have control of much wealth. He will live in a large apartment
building, hotel or mansion. His life will be moderately advantageous
in all respects.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         A bright year with many successes.
   Business and professional He will make good progress, and
                               will achieve a favorable reputation
                               or fame.
   Ordinary people             A good year to build, alter, or
                               expand one's property. Personal
                               wealth should increase.
Line}     The traveller's inn burns down, and he loses his loyal
servant. Persistence leads to danger.

Line 3 has the whole of trigram Li, fire, above it, and so depicts
the burning down of the lodgings, and, at the same time, the
losing of the servant, i.e, the support of line 1. In general, those
at the top of the mountain (Ken) tend to be stubborn, headstrong,
opinionated and contumacious, to a greater or lesser degree.
In their travelling, these persons do not adapt to the customs and
mores of the people around them, but arrogantly hold to their
own beliefs and behaviour. This leads to trouble and danger.
Most auspicious: He will be a tough and determined man, but

                                                                  581
3   I   The Predictions
will not have the social practicality and common sense to use his
gifts properly, and so will not gain a high position. He will love
to talk and to act big, which will frequently get him into
difficulties. He may make some profit from investments, but
his home life and career will be unsatisfactory.
Least auspicious: He will constantly imagine that life is better
somewhere other than where he happens to be, and he will
wander a lot. He will never truly establish himself, as he will be
handicapped by adverse personality traits.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He may lose his job or be demoted.
   Business and professional He may lose his status, position or
                               investments.
   Ordinary people              He will perhaps face an unexpected
                                emergency which results in disaster.
                               Someone in the family may die.
Line 4 The traveller has reached a resting place. He has his
resources and an axe. His mind is restless.

Only lines 2 and 3 are correctly positioned, so they have lodgings;
others only have shelters. These persons will have ample means
to carry out their mission, and will know how to protect them-
selves against adversities they may face. This line is at the
beginning of the trigram Li, clarity, so they are learning to
comport themselves in the right way under new and varying
conditions.
Most auspicious: He will be a talented and able person who
will frequently be advanced or assigned to new localities or
activities. He may be in industry, business, or the diplomatic or
military services. He will establish himself firmly wherever he is,
and will enjoy a favorable reputation. He will know how to
protect himself and his responsibilities, and will have a good life.
Least auspicious: He is likely to be a wandering merchant or
salesman, and always believing that there are better conditions
to be found elsewhere. His achievements will be minimal, and
his family life will be limited and not very satisfying.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be transferred or promoted,
                               and will gain mastery over his new
                               situation.
                                              3   I   The Predictions
  Business and professional  He will successfully establish some-
                             thing new.
   Ordinary people           He will gain profits or other
                             benefits, and he may travel con-
                             siderably. However, something un-
                             happy may occur.
Line 5 He shoots a pheasant with the flight of a single arrow.
In the end he wins praise and office.

Line 5 is the center of trigram Li and the acme of clarity, so
these persons will know exactly the right thing to do at all
times. In olden days, foreigners, especially statesmen, introduced
themselves by offering a pheasant. To have shot it personally,
with but one arrow, was commendable. This image also symbol-
izes persons of exceptional ability, who use what they have to the
best advantage, as suggested by the attaining of an office.
Most auspicious: He will be an outstanding individual, per-
sonally and professionally. He will begin his career early on, and
will win fame quickly. He will have high academic degrees and
will win other honors readily as well. He will accumulate much
wealth, as well as establishing merit for himself and his enter-
prises. He will have an exceptionally favorable life.
Least auspicious: He also will be a man of skill and diligence,
with a magnetic personality and excellent powers of com-
munication. He will hold an important local position, and will
have a good life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be in a position of high
                               status, without much responsibility.
   Business and professional He will increase his responsibilities
                                and make gains.
   Ordinary people              A very good year.
Line 6 The bird burns its nest. The traveller laughs, and then
later cries out. Through carelessness the cow is lost. Misfortune.

Persons who go to extremes are depicted here. It would be
extremely rare for a bird to burn its nest. Good, kind people
would not laugh. Losing one's cow symbolizes losing one's
docility. These persons will be antagonizing, irksome and even
perhaps malicious, and will be only interested in themselves.

                                                                  385

 Hexagram   57   Sun   ==   The Penetrating Wind


 SIMPLE   TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
The Penetrating Wind. Small efforts achieve success. It is
advantageous to have firm goals and to see the great man.

 COMMENTARY
  This hexagram is made up of the trigram Sun, signifying wind,
  doubled, and symbolizes achieving one's purposes through
. constancy. The wind acts in invisible ways, and attains results
  even though it is not seen. So this man, by using the powers of
  his mind, can develop thoughts which, if constantly reinforced
  will achieve his purposes. He should meditate and concentrate
  repeatedly on whatever he wishes to attain. By so doing, even
  small strength will, over an extended period of time, achieve its
  goals. Meditation and concentration are among the tools of all
  great men. Since the nature of what one thinks about influences
  what takes place, it is advantageous to have firm goals, as well
  as to follow the examples of great and wise men. The quantity
  and quality of one's mental influence is governed by one's
  controlling line.
     Those born in the fourth month will be more auspicious.

 CONTROLLING      LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM       TO TOP)
 Line I Advancing and retreating.        The    steadfastness     of a
 warrior is advantageous.

Line 1 is weak, when it should be strong, hence the image of
vacillation and indecisiveness. The advice here is to be like an
ancient warrior, i.e, to have a singleness of purpose coupled with
persistency. Thus one eliminates doubt in one's own mind, and
one's intentions become firm. This is excellent for the develop-
ment of the will.
Most auspicious: He will be a calm and thoughtful person.
Regrettably, he will be very slow to make up his mind. This will
be a definite handicap. He will begin to establish his career in a

                                                                   385

foreign land. He will have periods of hardship and periods of
ease. He may gain a favorable reputation as an author in his
professional field.
Least auspicious: He will start life in a position of low status,
and will never rise much above it. He will be indecisive and
vacillating. He will do well in a small business, but any efforts
put into a large enterprise will end in failure. He will be quite
narrow-minded, and he will do well in any activity where
attention to small detail is needed. On occasion he will be helped
by his peers and subordinates.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          A year with some advance and
                                some regression. He may be as-
                                signed two jobs at Once.
   Business and professional He will have some successes and
                                some failures. He should try to
                                pursue a firm goal.
   Ordinary people              He will have some gains and some
                                losses. Difficulties early in the
                                year will smooth out later.
Line z Penetrating wind beneath the couch. Many diviners and
exorcists are employed. Good fortune. No error.

The trigram Sun also represents wood. In ancient times couches
were made of wood. Looking beneath a couch signifies searching
out hidden motives, intangible influences and erroneous thoughts.
In those days this was the task of diviners and exorcists. Today it
is the task of knowledgeable men who possess common sense,
sound judgment, discernment and penetration. Their decisions
can influence the rise or fall of a particular matter, or even
determine the success or failure of an important enterprise. The
auspices here are favorable, and no error will result.
Most auspicious: He will be a clever man, with much virtue
and ability. He will have a love of people, and will deal respect-
fully with all. He will be beneficial to whatever enterprises he is
engaged in, and will rise to a high position, accomplishing worth-
while projects and achieving fame. He will have a rich and
rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will be a knowledgeable person, but will
have the weakness of trying to engage in too many different

    activities at once. He will be in a position where many facets of
    his ability will be involved, and he may be a doctor, a psychologist
    or a religious leader. He will have an average life, with modest
    success.
    In yearly hexagram:
       Officer or official          He may be promoted. In any event
                                    he will be involved with rules and
                                    regulations.
       Business and professional He will earn a highly favorable
                                    reputation.
       Ordinary people              If he is honest and reliable he will
                                    win support and achieve his desires,
                                    along with gains and profits.
    Line J Repeated penetration. Opprobrium.

    The third line is the lower line of man, in the six lines of a
    hexagram. This man will repeatedly seek to ascertain the results
    he can expect, rather than being courageous and making a firm
    decision, sticking to it, and carrying it through to completion.
    His actions will be shameful and disgraceful, and not worthy of
    a man of nobleness and distinction. These persons will have but
    little faith in themselves or in others. Consequently, they will
    make poor leaders and ineffective administrators.
    Most auspicious: He will be educated, but inflexible and
    adamant externally, while lacking courage inwardly. He will be
    unable to yield or accept sound advice. He will be proud and
    vain, and will easily exhaust his will-power. His methods will
    alienate him from others, including his family.
    Least auspicious: He will be extremely selfish, egotistical, and
    opinionated, with an inward lack of courage. He will be very
    disappointed because people do not like him. This results from
    his false attitude of superiority. He will become hardened later
    in life, to his own detriment. He will never have wealth.
    In yearly hexagram:
        Officer or official         He will be demoted.
        Business and professional He will be subjected to a sub-
                                    stantial demotion or loss.
        Ordinary people             He will maybe have some gains,
                                    maybe some losses. He is likely to
                                    suffer disdain and ill will from others.

Line 4 Regrets disappear. Game for three purposes is caught in
the field.

Th ese J'e"Orn will be in responsible positions " • result of their
ability, practicality, ambition, energy and ready experience,
which they will weld into a well-balanced and useful life. The
three purposes for which game was caught were religious
sacrifice, the feeding of guests, and household requirements. This
signifies that one should always do what is required, in all
circumstances, and hold right thoughts.
Most auspicious: He will be a well-educated individual of great
intelligence and common sense, yet gentle and modest. He will
have a highly favorable reputation, and will do much of benefit
for his country and its people. He is likely to be the head of a
large enterprise, possibly the governor of a state. In war, if in
command, he will win battles.
Least auspicious: He will have hardships early in life, easing
later on. He will be a very capable individual, who will accumu-
late wealth through service, and who will follow the principle
that it is necessary to give in order to receive. He will have an
enjoyable life.
In yearly hexagram:

Line 5 Persistent correctness advantageous. Regrets vanish.
Undertakings are favorable. A poor beginning, but a good end.
Three days before the change; three days after the change. Good
fortune.

As this is line 5, the advice here is directed to leaders and rulers.
It would appear that these persons have not yet perfected them-
selves for the positions they hold. They are cautioned to exercise
persistent correctness for the maximum success in advancement.
This they will naturally and intuitively do, and so their results
will be favorable. They are also warned to be deliberate in their
actions, analyzing them thoroughly in advance, and then noting

the reactions and effects later, in order to be sure that their rules,
ordinances and administration are what they should be. Since they
will tend to take all the right actions the results are favorably
presaged.
Most auspicious: He will be a personable, far-sighted and
knowledgeable individual, following a middle path. He will
plan matters in great detail, and will carry them through
effectively. He will be too cautious to be highly successful early
in life, but he will amend this fault as he progresses and will
have a highly successful and good life in all respects later.
Least auspicious: He will be exploratory by nature, advancing
from one enterprise to another until he finds the one which
completely satisfies him. In the end he will be successful, and
will have a good life with ample mental and material rewards.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will experience some vacillation
                                early on regarding the course he
                                should follow. Later he will reach
                                 a firm decision and will be suc-
                                cessful. He may be promoted, or
                                transferred to a more important
                                position.
   Business and professional Writings and well-presented plans
                                will be effective. He will add to his

                                favorably.
Line 6 Penetration under the couch. He loses his possessions
and his axe. Perseverance unfavorable.

This man is shown to be using his powers unreasonably, with
unfortunate results. He will have little confidence or faith in
himself or in others, and will try to ferret out possible secret
motives in everything. By so doing he will lose the power to make
decisions or take decisive action. Consequently, he will not be
successful in any enterprise. He will be able to use his mind for
personal development, but in view of his impracticality cannot
expect great achievements in his career.
Most auspicious: He will be calm, placid, and reasonably
content with what is available to him. He will be able to accept

                                                                    589

hardships and violence, and will know how to protect himself. He
will have a very modest life, but will be unconcerned about the
fact that his achievements are not great.
Least auspicious: He will be a person of mean disposition,
constantly questioning and suspicious, with shallow views
regarding the material world. Misfortunes will be unavoid-
able.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        He will resign, or be demoted or
                              dismissed.
   Business and professional There will be no possibilities for

comes in many forms, and it is the deep desire of most people to
attain it. Some joys are only superficial, while others stem from
deep within. Joy also comes from doing things well, and when
people are properly led. At such times people forget their troubles
and burdens, something all people wish for. Only pure joys
provide lasting satisfaction. That is why 'firm correctness' is
favorable. This hexagram also signifies the beneficial nature of
discussion and the practice of truth and learning. Some of the
persons with this natal hexagram will be talented in such a way
as to bring joy through leadership, some through cooperation and
companionship, some through personal accomplishments, and
some will be given over to, or at least strongly tempted by,
worldly pleasures. These persons will be found in nearly all
walks of life.
   Those born in the tenth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line   I   Harmonious joy. Good fortune.

Two forms of joy are depicted here, namely, that which auto-
matically springs from inner harmony, and the pure and
spontaneous joy that occurs when a pleasure is first felt. These
persons bring harmony to others, by example or through advice
and guidance. They will have a natural ability and propensity to
say joyous and ameliorative things, as the occasion dictates. They
will have a natural attraction, and others will enjoy being in their
presence, or participating with them in social or professional
activities.
Most auspicious: He will be a calm, clear-thinking individual,
with a remarkable ability to communicate. He will be a scholar as

                                                                 591

           well as a professional person, serving and working in harmony
           with others. He will establish himself early in life, and will
           accomplish many worthwhile things. He will have a favorable
           life in all respects.
           Least auspicious: He will be kind, considerate, gentle, and at
           peace with himself. Although quite capable of entering a pro-
           fession, he will prefer nature and a rural existence, finding
           contentment and happiness with the simple things in life.
           In yearly hexagram:
              Officer or official        He will be helped and supported,
                                         and will earn praise.
              Business and professional A harmonious year, with coopera-
                                         tion and progress.
              Ordinary people            A harmonious year, with much
                                         domestic felicity.
           Line 2 Sincere joy. Good fortune. Absence of regrets.

           The joy in the hexagram as a whole is brought about by the
           strong Yang lines, 1 and 2. Even though a Yang line in this
           position is not correct, this person acts in a genuine way, and
           conforms to what is right, hence the very favorable auspices for
           this line. Capable men of broad vision, who understand to an
           appreciable degree the workings of the universe, the world they
           live in, their fellow men and themselves, are depicted here.
           They will use their wisdom effectively and sincerely at all times,
           within the limits of their understanding.
           Most auspicious: He will be a man of brilliant talent and virtue,
           knowledgeable with regard to the important aspects of life, and
           dealing sincerely with everyone. He will be trusted, supported
           and respected by his leader, and by all others as well, and will
           accomplish a number of worthwhile and beneficial projects. He
           will have a good life, and will become famous.
           Least auspicious: He also will be a well-educated and wise
           individual, who can communicate well with others and will
           handle matters with sincerity. He will bring about harmony,
           wherever he is. He will have no serious troubles or regrets in his life.
           In yearly hexagram:
              Officer or official         Promotion is probable.
              Business and professional He can expect advancement and
                                          gains.

  Ordinary people            A harmonious     year. Previous
                             troubles and difficulties will be
                             solved.
Line]    Coming joy. Misfortune.

Attraction to worldly joys and pleasures is depicted here as this
is a weak line in a strong place, and line 5. The attraction
to, and experience of, fleeting joys results in misfortune. This
line also represents persons who try to gain wealth, position
or influence through offering worldly pleasures, or who use
fawning, ingratiating methods in their efforts to achieve their
aims.
Most auspicious: He will be able to communicate with powerful
and wealthy persons, and to get some help by this means. He will
not be able to use this help properly, so his advances will be
fleeting, and he will never accomplish anything truly worthwhile.
He will be able, however, to keep himself employed.
Least auspicious: He will have a fawning, ingratiating person-
ality, which he will use to excess; reactions will set in, with the
result that he gets into trouble for his efforts. He will have an
unhappy and unsatisfactory life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He is likely to lose his honor
                                through fawning.
   Business and professional He will be constantly worried
                                 about gains and losses.
   Ordinary people              He will tend to follow blindly, or
                                to go against his principles, with
                                resultant misfortune.
Line 4 While weighing joys he is restless. He verges on the
injurious, but there is still cause for joy.

When one ponders over the kinds of joy one should strive for or
accept one is restless until one rids oneself of seductive pleasures,
thereby finding true inner peace. These persons will be beset by
allurements, but will have the strength to forgo temporary
pleasure and rise above them if they so desire. By so doing, they
are able to obtain some of the blessings of pure joy. These will be
knowledgeable persons, serving in supporting roles and positions,
in which they will frequently face the choice between a seemingly

                                                                   393

easy path and the slower, more deliberate, and eventually more
correct way.
Most auspicious: He will associate with wise and able persons,
and keep away from heretical and debasing persons. He will act
with sound judgment in all matters. He will also take timely and
propitious actions, resulting in highly beneficial achievements.
He will also be a good communicator.
Least auspicious: He will vacillate between what is good and
what is bad. He will be unstable and will change his mind
frequently, but he will also frequently be stubborn and in-
flexible. He will be a generally difficult person, and he will
find it hard to support himself and his family.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be in an important
                               position, but pestered by obsequious
                               persons. Promotion is likely.
   Business and professional He will win a well-deserved award
                               or distinction.
   Ordinary people             The size of his family will increase.
                               Business will flourish. For the
                               least auspicious: Illnesses will not
                               cure easily, and he may have
                               mental difficulties.
Line 5 Misplaced trust in disintegrating matters is dangerous.

This person will tend to trust the weak man above him (line 6)
rather than the strong man below (line 4), since he is envious of
the latter being nearly his equal. Leaders and rulers will place
their faith and trust in the wrong people, which will lead to
many mistakes and embarrassments, and perhaps even to serious
troubles. In general, these persons will be very knowledgeable,
but will be lacking in the innate qualities necessary for good
leadership, and in practicality. Their sense of values will be
distorted to a greater or lesser degree.
Most auspicious: He will rise to an honorable position by
consistent virtuousness, but will put his trust in mean persons.
This will tend to destroy his effectiveness and profitability, and
will occasionally even threaten his position. He will have a
modestly favorable private life.
Least auspicious: He will follow no firm or set goals, either

privately or professionally, and hence will vacillate, to the
detriment of himself and those associated with him. Sometimes
he will act in an unrestrained manner, and this will usually lead
to trouble. He will have some gains and some losses.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will have troubles due to
                               misrepresentation.
   Business and professional Set-backs are likely.
   Ordinary people             He will be disturbed by evil forces.
                               A difficult year.
Line 6 Alluring joy.

The idea behind the image is that this line, a weak Yin in its
proper place, is trying to draw the strong lines, 4 and 5, with it
on the path of worldly joy. For the more auspicious the direction
will be towards good, but the less auspicious will be seduced by
their own vanity. The persons depicted here will truly exemplify
the principle that like attracts like.
Most auspicious: He will be a well-educated and noble person,
who will give others a feeling of harmony, and will lead and
guide them along the right paths. He will have an effective and
rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will be confused by evil and often seduced.
He will envy the world, and he will not be respected by others.
His wishes will fail, and he will be unfortunate in life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be pleased with and
                                helped by, a colleague.
   Business and professional He will be recommended, but will
                                make little advancement.
   Ordinary people              He will have very few gains, if
                                 any.
                                He may be injured, or have eye
                                trouble or infections.

Hexagram        59   Huan        =-=   Dispersion (Disintegration)


SIMPLE        TRANSLATION          OF TEXT
Dispersion. Success. The king goes to his ancestral temple.
Advantageous to cross the great waters. Firm correctness brings
rewards.

COMMENTARY
The hexagram is composed of the trigram Sun, wind, over trigram
K'an, water. Strong winds blowing over water create dispersion
and scattering. The upper trigram also represents wood, which
provides a means to ride over troubled waters. In another sense,
it is mental penetration, by means of which troubles can be
corrected or averted. Line 5 is of the right polarity, and the ruler
will find it best to gain enlightenment at his family temple.
Having received guidance, it is necessary for him to take action,
which, if it is firm and correct, will bring rewards. Those depicted
here will be involved in overcoming estrangements and con-
ditions of disorders, and will be agents of law enforcement,
legislators, counselors, etc. Much mental activity is predicted
here, and for the most part it will be ably and effectively per-
formed, as well as the use of devices to promote unity, such as

music, ceremony, religious rites and festivals, etc. Persistence and
constancy are important qualities to be developed. Admittedly,
the greater their intelligence and training, the better will be
their achievements.
   Those born in the third month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
Line I Helping others with the strength of a horse. There will
be good fortune.

Line 1 is weak, and should be strong. Also, it has no correlate
in line 4, so it has to seek support from the strong line 2 above it,
the 'horse' in the image. As a horse can roam anywhere, so the
help here can be limitless. This is useful in dealing with incipient
dispersion or disintegration, which can be corrected fairly easily
before it gets out of hand. Since rendering service to one's fellow
men is one of the fundamental principles of our world, those
depicted here will, in general, have good lives.
Most auspicious: He will be a knowledgeable and noble
individual, setting a good example to others. He will be courageous
in carrying out what is right. He will accomplish his purposes and
achieve some things of lasting benefit. He will have the respect
and support of the people, and he will help stabilize his country.
His professional and personal lives will be rewarding.
Least auspicious: He also will establish himself easily, accom-
plish worthwhile projects, be beneficial to others, and have a nice
home and a good life.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official          He will enjoy quicker progress than
                                 usual.
    Business and professional He will receive a boost, in both
                                 finances and status.
    Ordinary people              He will be helped by his superiors.
                                 Strong desires will be fulfilled.
 Line 2 Amid dispersion he hurries to that which supports him.
 Regrets vanish.

Line 2, a strong line, is in the middle of the dispersion caused by
lines 1 and 3, as if placed in a valley or gorge, and is the center
line of the trigram K' an peril. This man will either have

                                                                   397

disintegration and alienation all around him, or else he will perceive
the beginnings of such within himself. By adopting a positive
attitude, and initiating corrective action, he will be able to
overcome dangers. Strong, noble, penetrating, courageous and
dynamic persons are indicated. Such persons are vital to every
agency and activity; the nature of their work will depend on
their own natural bent.
Most auspicious: He will be a good man, with much common
sense and practicality, following a middle way. He will know the
value of, and will use, a positive attitude. He will be analytical,
and will observe changes in people, with time and will take
rectifying actions as necessary. He will have hardships early in
life, but circumstances will ease later, giving a good life.
Least auspicious: He will have to go out into the world on his
own, early in life. He will have much work and many hardships,
but his efforts will be more effective later in life, and he will then
enjoy a quiet and moderately wealthy existence.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be assigned to a high and
                                powerful position.
   Business and professional He will achieve fame or a favorable
                                reputation.
   Ordinary people              Strong desires will be fulfilled and
                                household matters will improve.
                                The least auspicious may wander
                                into, or escape from, danger.
Line}     Dispersion of self. No regrets.

Those persons are destined to serve others. They will be of little
value to the world except through renunciation of self and
possessions. This means getting rid of everything that might
prove a barrier to working with, and understanding, others.
Their goals must be completely altruistic, and as universal as
possible, for the best results. Their accomplishments will be so
satisfying that these persons will have no regrets over the life
they lead.
Most auspicious: He will work for his community or country,
correcting any major mistakes that occur. He will serve both his
leader and the people well. He will spend much time away from
home, but otherwise will have a very good home life.

Least auspicious: He will go out into the world on his own,
early in life, and will establish himself in a foreign land. He will
have a middling life, with neither great achievements nor major
difficulties. He will have a good life, and may turn to the
cultivation of himself as his mode of existence.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He will be transferred to an outside
                                 position.
   Business and professional He should consider the possibility
                                 of changing his location for the
                                 rendering greater service to others.
   Ordinary people               Enterprises will be profitable, and
                                 troubles will dissolve.
Line 4 He dissolves established bonds. Sublime good fortune.
Dispersion leads to accumulation, but ordinary people do not
understand this.

The necessity to give before one can receive has been understood
and applied by leaders at all levels throughout the ages. These
persons must forget themselves in the interests of their public,
rising above man-made rules, party factions and exclusive
associations in their efforts at impartial service. By so doing they
will truly give, and from their actions attain sublime good
fortune. Only truly dedicated persons, in high and influential
positions, can successfully work for the benefit of many.
Most auspicious: He will be a man of vision and insight. He
will establish himself early on in a noble manner, and will
achieve fame for his meritorious accomplishments. He will
abolish separatist activities and quell selfish cliques. He will be
trusted by his leader, and will unify the people through his
own leadership. He will have a very favorable life.
Least auspicious: He also will be a brilliant and successful
leader. He will make gains and benefit from every enterprise in
which he engages. He will enjoy a variety of activity, and will
change his job several times in his life. He will have a modestly
beneficial and successful life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He will be in a high position, and
                                 exercising command.
   Business and professional New proposals will be successful.

                                                                 599

    Ordinary people          Troubles will dissolve, and plans
                             materialize. Wishes will be fulfilled.
Line 5 Amid dispersion he issues commands, with much
perspiration. The king dispenses his treasures. No error.

Two symbolisms are expressed here. Just as sweating breaks a
fever, so will the king's proclamations disperse and cure rebellious
thoughts and actions. The second image shows the king employing
the principle that to give is to receive. By giving to the people he
will receive much more in return. Wise and able leadership is
depicted here. These persons will be called upon to correct
unhealthy conditions, some of which will have been brought
about by their own mistakes, and some of which will be the
fault of others. In the end no grave errors will occur.
Most auspicious: He will be in an important and influential
position, carrying out his duties with a deep love of people and
an innate respect for what is right and just. He will establish
much of benefit to others, and will be duly rewarded in return.
He will merit a highly favorable reputation.
Least auspicious: He will be ambitious and knowledgeable. He
will always aim high, and will enjoy winning others over. He
will rise from a position of low status to modest fame and honors.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be promoted.

                                ment.
   Ordinary people              He will gain profits. If sick he will
                                be healed.
Line 6 Dispersing the blood. Going out, and separating himself
from it, is without blame.

This line will, on occasion, suffer problems, owing to its correlate
being line 3, which is at the top of the trigram K'an, peril. These
persons must disperse those matters and situations which might
lead to bloodshed and wounds. This applies in his personal life,
and in his dealings with his associates, his work, and his country.
He must act in such a manner as will keep danger away, or take
appropriate action to dissolve and disperse danger when en-
countered. Only strong, courageous and wise persons will be
successful in this.

SIMPLE      TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
Restraint. Success. Harsh restraints will not endure.

COMMENTARY
This hexagram is composed of the trigram K'an, water, over
trigram Tui, lake. A lake is limited in size, while water is un-
limited. Therefore restraints must be imposed on the water to
keep the lake from overflowing. Primarily, this hexagram is a
symbol of correct government through wise rules for the guidance
and control of the people. Proper restraints will produce proper
success. Harsh restraints will not be adhered to, and consequently
will not endure. As stated before, I Ching is designed principally
for superior persons. The persons born under this hexagram are
advised how best they can circumscribe themselves and their
lives for the most satisfactory relations with others. This is vital,
so that all partners can know what to expect and how to act
properly. Broadly speaking, the restraints are brought about by
the upper three lines and imposed on the lower three. Restraint
is necessary at all levels of society and in every activity. These
persons will be intimately connected, either with the developing
of restraints, or with their application and execution. These are
worthwhile and vital functions, since true freedom can only be
exercised within duly circumscribed limits.
    Those born in the eleventh month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING         LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM     TO TOP)
. Line I    Remaining within the courtyard outside the door. No
  error.

These persons will know their prescribed limits, and will keep
within them. Line 1 is strong in the right place, and hence would
exercise power and go its own way. Because this line has its

correlate in line 4, the first line of the trigram K'an, peril, this
man will realize that it is wisest for him to keep calm and tranquil
and not try to exceed due limits in any way. Since he will do this
of his own free will, he will be exercising proper restraint,
conforming to customs and mores, and will be perfecting his own
conduct.
Most auspicious: He will have great knowledge, both academ-
ically and practically, and will truly understand the nature and
laws of change. His actions and proposals will affect the laws of
his country. He will be well known for his works and efforts, and
will have a good life in all respects.
Least auspicious: He will have much common sense, and will
follow accepted ways and means. He will not be envious, nor
unduly competitive. He will hold his own professionally, but will
resist change. His life will be free from major troubles.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           No changes are predicted.
   Business and professional It will be best for him to remain
                                 within accepted limits.
   Ordinary people               Be conservative, and avoid major
                                 changes.
Line z Not going out from the inner gate and courtyard.
Misfortune.

Line z is a strong line in a weak place and so cannot exert its
strength properly. It is also held back by the strong line 5. These
restraints will definitely limit the potential of these persons, and
give them the characteristic of holding back when they ought to
be taking action. Even though inwardly they will have the
potential to be leaders, destiny will restrain them and limit their
effectiveness.
Most auspicious: Although he will be talented, either he will
not know how to display his abilities properly, or else situations
and circumstances will be such that his abilities will not be
recognized or cannot be used. His progress likewise will be limited
and restrained. He is advised to look inward and improve himself,
rather than contest his destiny unsuccessfully in the external
world. His personal life will be modest yet satisfactory.
Least auspicious: He will be moderately well educated, but
dull-witted and bound by conventions. He will be a poor
5   I   The Predictions
communicator, and will not look for ways to progress but will stick
instead to old and obsolete methods. He will accomplish nothing
worthwhile, and his family life will lack felicity.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official        Following old methods will lead to
                              difficulties. He should innovate,
                              and initiate activity.
   Business and professional As above.
   Ordinary people            He may miss a favorable oppor-
                              tunity by sticking to old ideas.
 Line} By not observing due restraint he will have cause to
 lament. No blame.

Here at the top of trigram Tui, the water from above, i.e, the
upper trigram, is filling the lake to the point of overflowing,
indicating that restraints are not being observed. This will
obviously bring cause for lament. Here, 'no blame' signifies that
he has had no one to blame but himself, line 3 being weak and
having no proper correlate.
Most auspicious: He will attain a high position and a large
salary, but will not be frugal, spending gains quickly and never
establishing himself on a sound financial basis. He will also be
careless with the financial state of his business, and will face
many worries and uncertainties.
Least auspicious: He will be envious of others, and servile,
always trying to gain something for little or nothing. He will
quite likely miss his footing in his haste for gain, and will seldom
make a real profit. He will have means enough for food and
shelter, but he will never be truly happy.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He is likely to go to extremes of
                                extravagance.
   Business and professional He is likely to use unethical
                                practices, with resultant difficulties.
   Ordinary people              He will worry constantly about
                                money and the cost of living.
 Line 4 Contentment with restraint. Success.

Line 4- is weak, as it should be, and subject to the good, strong
leadership of line 5. Hence, these persons will be content with the
                                              3   I   The Predictions
restraints imposed upon them, and will abide within their
limitations. Loyal and obedient persons are depicted, who are
ideally suited for their supporting positions, and, under the
guidance of strong leaders, will effectively and efficiently carry
out all that is expected of them. This will give great pleasure and
satisfaction to their leaders. This mutual cooperation will be
productive of many accomplishments and much success.
Most auspicious: He will help the ruler or leader successfully,
and will follow the golden mean. He will accomplish many
worthwhile projects, and will maintain his positions with ease.
His advice will be sought by both his juniors and his seniors.
He will have a rich and rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will be moderately talented, and well
qualified for the positions he will hold. These may not be very
high, but they will provide him with an easy, generally trouble-
free life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will become the favorite of his
                                leader or manager.
   Business and professional He will achieve a highly favorable
                                reputation.
   Ordinary people              If he is law-abiding and godfearing
                                he will have a favorable year.
Line 5 Employing acceptable restrain. Good fortune. Advancing
brings success.

Line 5 is strong in the right position, but without a correlate.
Hence it signifies persons who regulate their lives well, with
restraint, as well as imposing restraints that are acceptable to
others. Many leaders impose rules and regulations, which, instead
of correcting and curbing evil, merely bring additional hardships
to those who are good anyway. Truly wise, noble and virtuous
leadership is depicted here. It will be coupled with a great love
and deep understanding of people. Consequently, the actions of
these leaders will be beneficial to all, and will result in good
fortune.
Most auspicious: He will be in a high position, and his efforts
will result in beneficial and acceptable systems and regulations.
He will be respected by nearly everyone, and he will place his
country or his enterprise in a sound financial position. He will
3   I   The Predictions
gain well-earned fame, and his life will be highly beneficial and
rewarding, for himself, his family and his country.
Least auspicious: He will regulate his life within acceptable
limits, and will demand and receive the like from others. He will
be content with modest accomplishments, and will have a good
life, with sufficient funds, frugally managed, but never luxury.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He can expect promotion.
   Business and professional He will advance in all spheres.
   Ordinary people               Strong desires will be fulfilled.
Line 6 Irritating      restraint. Persistent enforcement brings
misfortune. Later, remorse disappears.

Idealism has replaced practicality here, as is often the case with
the sixth line. The vast majority of people are not sufficiently
advanced for idealistic rules and regulations, and will rebel,
feeling them to be unjust. Efforts to try and enforce irritating
restraints will only lead to further difficulties and increased
violations. This will bring misfortune, for all concerned. Some-
times, however, it is only through strict self-discipline that
lasting corrections can be made. In such cases, if the leaders
willingly impose self-restraint and set a good example themselves,
others will gradually follow and the occasion for sternness will
pass.
Most auspicious: He will be in a high position, yet modest,
reverent, incorruptible, honest and plain-spoken. He may be
quite idealistic, and probably exceedingly frugal. He will deal
with situations as they come, and will never complain.
Least auspicious: He will be a difficult person, austere and
stingy. He will have many impractical ideas, and have difficulty
adapting himself to life. He will have few friends, many regrets,
and perhaps even some serious misfortune.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be wrong to hold stub-
                                bornly to his own ideas.
   Business and professional He will be suspicious of his
                                associates and peers.
   Ordinary people              He will try to accomplish some-
                                thing that is beyond his ability.
                                If old, he may die.

Hexagram 61      Chung Fu   ---=   Inner Sincerity (Truth)


SIMPLE   TRANSLATION        OF TEXT
Inner Sincerity. Pigs and dolphins. Good fortune. Advantageous
to cross the great water; beneficial to be firm and correct.

COMMENTARY
The hexagram is composed of the trigram Sun, wind, over trigram
Tui, lake. The invisible action of the wind manifests in its visible
effect on water. The hexagram is open within (lines 3 and 4),
with two strong lines at each end. On the whole, the pig is con-
sidered to be one of the least intelligent animals, and the
dolphin among the most intelligent. A man's inner strength,
therefore, must be truly great for him to be able to influence all
3 / The Predictions
animals. Such a power is bound to bring good fortune. This
hexagram also signifies inner sincerity that can influence,
unsuspected by the recipient. Persons born under this hexagram
are specifically enjoined to use whatever abilities they have, and
not leave any dormant. This should be an important precept in
anyone's life. Since a man's external influence stems from within,
one must be careful regarding the nature of one's thoughts and
meditations. Maximum effectiveness will be achieved when
mental barriers have been removed and doors opened. Establish-
ing a rapport with others will be exceptionally helpful. These
persons will have such inner strength of character that they will
influence many others, both near and far. In general, they will
do this with an open heart (the hexagram being open in the
middle) and without guile. The degree of their influence will be
determined by their controlling line, and by their karmic level
and their intelligence. Since their influence will often be un-
conscious and great, they should periodically check the effects
they are having on others, and make adjustments as necessary.
   Those born in the eighth month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING      LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line I Quietly developing inner sincerity. Good fortune. Any
insincerity is disquieting.

This line is very difficult to translate precisely, but the meaning
is clear, namely, that following a path of moderation, developing
oneself constantly and maintaining sincerity, is bound to bring
good fortune. Those who have the persistence and tenacity to
carry out such a course will have highly favorable lives. Inner
strength and sincerity are always keys to success in life; this is
especially true for those who try to develop these qualities
deliberately.
Most auspicious: He will be a noble person, gentle and obedient,
who follows the golden mean. He will be a clever and intelligent
individual, constantly striving to improve himself and those with
whom he comes into contact. He will help his leader establish
merit, and will be duly recompensed. He will have a good family
life.
Least auspicious: He will vacillate in his aims and intentions,
and hence will be generally unstable. He will frequently consider
.fo08
                                              3   I   The Predictions
changes, seeking to ascertain his purpose in life. He will probably
achieve clarity of purpose too late in life to be very effective.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be recommended for a
                               higher position.
   Business and professional He will be recommended by others.
   Ordinary people             He will receive help from his
                               superiors, but will have some
                               personal sorrow or worry. If he
                               follows the golden mean, he will
                               have reasonable success. Following
                               an easy, care-free life will lead to
                               failures.
Lme z The crane calls in seclusion. The young respond to her.
I have a fine goblet, and will share it with you.

A crane's young can hear and recognize their mother's call at a
great distance, even when she is hidden. This indicates two
things, namely, that one's heartfelt desires will meet with a
response from those of like mind, and that one's thoughts are
able to transcend the limitations of space. Sharing a goblet of
wine symbolizes a willingness to respond to persons of a kindred
nature to oneself, especially those of corresponding virtue.
Events will come to pass as an echo of that which is within, and
as the effects of concentrated thought. This man's thoughts will
travel to all parts of the world. Hence, he must be very careful
about the attitudes that he holds, and his desires. He will be
knowledgeable in the uses and powers of the mind, and will
employ what he knows, according to his ability. His thoughts, in
general, will serve mankind well.
Most auspicious: He will be a contemplative and learned person,
with excellent powers of communication. He will follow the
golden mean, in thought, word and deed, to the best of his ability.
His influence will be natural and of great magnitude, and he
will accomplish many worthwhile projects. He will have a
highly satisfactory life in all respects.
Least auspicious: He also will be a man of virtue and excellent
behaviour. He will be highly respected and well loved. He will be
versed in literature, and professionally capable. He will be aided
through wealth, or by superior persons, and will have a son who
3   I   The Predictions
one day will be outstanding. His life will be moderately good in
all respects, with no major troubles.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He can expect promotion.
   Business and professional He will advance and have gains.
   Ordinary people             He will gain profits, and may
                               have a child. Strong desires will be
                               fulfilled.
Line}     He meets an enemy. Now he beats a drum. Now he
stops. Now he weeps. Now he sings.

Line 6 is the proper correlate of line 3, and, being a Yang line,
is stronger than the Yin of line 3. Regrettably, both are incorrect
for their positions, so the influence of line 6 will not be consistent
nor always COrrect.This signifies that these are persons who will
find their source of strength in others. Unfortunately, others are
not always around to help, guide or direct them, so they will
frequently vacillate. Some solo efforts will be made, but many of
these will result in mistakes. Their situation will alternate
rapidly between good and bad.
Most auspicious: He will have no wise or clever father or
brother to help rear and guide him. Furthermore, he will fail
to find the right teachers and friends to support him. His goals
will not be firm and he will frequently waver. He will work hard,
and may gain considerable wealth, but he will have difficulty
keeping it. His irresolution will be reflected in his personal life.
Least auspicious: He will be a weak person, possessing little
sincerity, who will frequently be deceitful, and will often pose as
something other than what he is. He will also vacillate repeatedly.
Eventually he will b(' reduced to a solitary existence.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official          He will not be in harmony with
                                 his colleagues. He may be ad-
                                 vanced, only to subsequently resign.
    Business and professional Joys and gains will be fleeting.
    Ordinary people               He will experience alternate periods
                                 of joy and sadness, gains and
                                 losses.
 Line 4 The moon is nearly full. The composition of the team of
horses is altered. No error.
                                              3   I   The Predictions
In the ancient days, chariots were drawn by four horses. In a
hexagram these are represented by lines 1 and 40 and 2 and 5.
Here, line 1 is not the proper correlate of line 40 and goes astray.
Line 40 then seeks support from line 5. Since both lines 40 and 5
are in their proper places, no error occurs. Inner sincerity and
truth are deepened through the guidance and leadership of
superior persons, or by their words, just as the moon receives its
light from the sun. To receive additional enlightenment from a
superior person requires, first, a strong desire, second, a proper
attitude, and third, the establishment of a true rapport. Few
there are who can achieve this with the necessary humility and
wisdom to be able to learn from a true sage. Great selflessness
and dedication are demanded.
Most auspicious: He will work for the good of his country, for
its leader and for the people. He will dissolve cliques and factions
that try to tear down and replace existing controls. He will have
an influential position and will be respected by the various leaders
of the nation. He will have a richly endowed mind, and his entire
family will repose trust in him.
Least auspicious: He will be quickwitted and clever, but
lacking in fundamental wisdom. He will have difficulty achieving
long term gains and benefits. He may have financial, marital or
parental difficulties.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official         He will receive a well-deserved
                                advancement.
    Business and professional He will have professional gains and
                                much satisfaction.
    Ordinary people             He will probably be helped by a
                                superior person. He may lose a
                                valued possession.
 Line 5 Perfect sincerity. Uniting closely. No error.

This line is the position of the leader, and in this case he will be
a sage, whose deep sincerity will go forth and bind all together.
These persons will be truth-loving, just, honorable and in-
genuous. They will possess great knowledge, practicality and a
deep love of people. They will also be able communicators.
Most auspicious: He will possesssincerity in the highest degree,
together with nobleness and virtue. He will know how to govern

                                                                  411

3   I   The Predictions
the country and his own enterprises. His leadership will auto-
matically unite the people, who will follow him with devotion.
He will accomplish much of lasting benefit, and will have a
favorable life in all respects.
Least auspicious: He also will be a knowledgeable and practical
man of virtue, leading others capably. He will be respected by his
juniors and his seniors alike. He will have an abundance of
enjoyments, and a long and satisfying life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be highly trusted, and
                                assigned to an important position.
   Business and professional He will advance and achieve
                                renown.
   Ordinary people              A year of harmony, with all
                                things proceeding smoothly.
Line 6 The cock's crow strives to reach heaven. Persistence
brings misfortune.

Line 6 is strong, and ought to be weak. After the great strength
and auspiciousness of line 5, here there is a natural decline.
Admittedly, the cock is dependable in its crowing, but by
attempting to reach heaven it is trying to do the impossible, and
persistence in such efforts will lead to misfortune. Many of these
persons will strive to be thorough, with confidence and sincerity,
and will be modestly successful. Others will be impractical or
deceptive and will try to perform tasks beyond their abilities,
with unfortunate results.
Most auspicious: He will achieve fame in his youth, and will
rise to a high position. He 'will retire from public life in his senior
years, as a result of not being able to adapt and keep up to date.
Least auspicious: He will rise to a moderately high position
early in life. He will be stubborn, headstrong and intractable,
and will not be able to maintain his position or status. By living
in seclusion he will be able to have a favorable existence.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official           He will have the satisfaction of
                                being close to the leader or ruler.
   Business and professional He will advance in all aspects of his
                                profession.
   Ordinary people               He will find himself competing

                                with others for supremacy. He
                                will have disputes, and will prob-
                                ably lose money.

KEYNOTES
1.   Deep sincerity is bound to bring good fortune.
2.   Inner strength is echoed externally.
3.   Avoid being dependent on others.
4.   Never cease deepening your sincerity.
5.   Leaders must be sincere and ingenuous.
6.   Sincerity must be combined with adaptability.

CONDENSATIONS        FOR   DAILY   CYCLES
1. You have now learned which is the right direction, and are
beginning to follow it. Be as self-reliant as possible.
2. Your heartfelt desires will find a response in those attuned to
you. Remember that it is divine will that one should render
service to others. Do so.
3. You are finding that some of the lessons you have to learn are
tough. Do not make the same mistakes twice.
4. You are now well ahead, and are still advancing. Follow your
course without deviating.
5. Remember that the power of inner truth binds all together,
and results in good.
6. Being over-confident, and bragging about your capabilities
and good fortune, is selfish, and destroys the power of inner
truth. Check yourself.


Hexagram     62   Hsiao Kuo   ==    Outer Preponderance


SIMPLE     TRANSLATION      OF TEXT
Outer Preponderance. Success. Persistence furthers. Small
things should be done, but not great things. The flying bird
means that it is better to remain low than to strive too high.
Great good fortune.

COMMENTARY
External extravagances and excessive displays of emotion should
not be indulged in. There will be success in small matters, but
3   I   The Predictions
not in big ones. The humble will be favored. The mighty should
bide their time. These statements have their basis in the visual
appearance of the hexagram, with its preponderance of weak
lines, and the two strong lines in the center. The shape also
suggests a soaring bird (d. hexagram z8). These persons will
have a tendency to do everything to excess, e.g. being miserly
instead of thrifty, imposing on others when helping them instead
of merely providing support and doing good, and making a
display of sorrow in bereavement instead of keeping one's grief
within the bounds of good manners. Birds that fly too high get
into difficulties. A man who strives too high for his abilities will
likewise experience troubles. Great good fortune will come from
remaining where one ought to be, and from doing whatever is
expected of one in one's position. Naturally, it is right to strive
upward, but the goals should be reasonably attainable. Some of
these persons will learn from bitter experience the value of
modesty, humility, and proceeding one step at a time. Regrettably,
others will never learn.
   Those born in the second month will be more auspicious.

Line    I   The ascending bird meets with misfortune.

V\Thenanyone tries to act in a manner for which he is not duly
prepared or qualified, misfortune is bound to be the result.
Those who are born under this line will have a propensity to step
forward without looking, to act with but little understanding,
and to talk when they should be listening. They should remember
that in the hands of the Great Architect no material is useless,
and that they too serve a purpose, even though it will not seem
as important as that of many others.
Most auspicious: He will receive a good education, and will
establish himself early in life. He will rise to a high position, in
his prime. He will then be favored by the leader and much
sought-after by the people which will make him arrogant,
proud and vain, resulting in his downfall. His home life will be
affected likewise.
Least auspicious: He will constantly make efforts to rise,
relying mainly on his own strength. Through making some good
gains early on, he too will become arrogant and vain, resulting

in many troubles and a disruption of his household and family
life.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official       He will tend to advance too fast,
                             and run into difficulties.
   Business and professional Steering a middle course will keep
                             him from trouble.
   Ordinary people           If he tries to rise in position, he is
                             likely to get into difficulties. He
                             will fare well if he remains modest
                             and humble.
Line 2 Passing his ancestor he meets his ancestress. He does not
meet the ruler but the minister. No error.

Line 5 is the normal correlate of line 2, but here it is weak, so
line 2 receives help instead from line 4, bypassing the strong
third line. Since line 2 is of the correct polarity, no error is made.
This person will stick to whatever work he is best suited for, and
will do whatever is right for the circumstances in which he finds
himself. The help from line 4 is not as great as that he would
have received from a strong ruler, but is sufficient to be quite
favorable. These persons will be helped throughout their lives
by others higher than themselves, but not by those in the top
positions.
Most auspicious: He will be modest in his outward relations,
serving his ruler and leader well. He will be famous for his
writings and philosophy. His principal desire will be to be useful
 and serve his country and his fellow men well, which he will do
to a high degree. In return he will be helped and supported by
others. His family life will be of substance, yet frugal.
 Least auspicious: He will be modest, and will possess singleness
 of purpose. His friends and superiors will help him, and he will
 serve his community, his business and his family well.
 In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official           If he does a good job he will be

5   I   The Predictions
Line}    Taking no precautions against danger provides others
with the opportunity to attack him from behind. Misfortune.

This image derives from the unprotected top of the mountain
(K~n) being subjected to thunder (Chen), and the symbolism
being applied to human life. Wise persons will heed the warning
and will exercise prudence, whereas others will believe themselves
to be stronger than a mountain and will act in a disdainful
manner. Good judgment and common sense demand that
appropriate precautions be taken in all circumstances, not only
for one's own sake, but also for the sake of those whom one is
serving and those who are dependent on one.
Most auspicious: He will be born wise, and will know how to
prepare in advance against calamities, mental and physical. He
will have a strong and noble character, and will be able to subdue
people when necessary. He will protect himself and his family
well, and will have a good life.
Least auspicious: He will be disdainful of precautions, and will
rely on his own strength and ability. Since no man is an island,
this will result in frequent troubles.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          Evil will arise. Be careful.
   Business and professional Progress will appear blocked.
   Ordinary people              Only extreme care will avert
                                troubles.
Line 4 No error. He meets his situation without exceeding it.
Proceeding brings danger. Exercise care. Nothing demands
unceasing firmness.

This line symbolizes the exercise of moderation. One should
never go to extremes, and at the same time it is equally wrong
to always remain absolutely central. Here, a strong line is held
in check by its weak position, so this man will tend to avoid
extremes of behaviour. Hence, 'no error.' However, if he tries to
exceed his position, or do that for which he is not duly qualified,
he will be going to an extreme, and this will bring danger in its
wake. He should also remember that no situation is ever such
that perpetual obduracy is the right course. One should be
flexible, to the degree that the situation demands.
Most auspicious: He will rise to a high position, yet will remain

humble. He will have due pride but will never be arrogant. He
will show an interest in serving others, and will be careful to
maintain correctness, tempered by good judgment. He will
establish sound rules and will be flexible in their execution.
He will have a highly favorable and beneficial life.
Least auspicious: He also will be a man of sincerity, with a love
of people. He will lead a well-planned, circumspect life, comfort-
ably and quietly, seeking no great wealth or glory.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will have nothing to fear. A

   Ordinary people             A year of contentedness, with no
                               losses.
Line 5 Dense clouds, but no rain from the western regions. The
prince shoots an arrow and hits him who is in the cave.

For the most part, in China, rain comes from the east, the
direction of the ocean. Clouds from the west are without
sufficient moisture to produce rain. This (d. hexagram 9)
signifies a time for preparations. The line is weak, so a prince is
depicted here, rather than a king as is normal in this position.
His ability is not too great, since he shoots a bird in a cave
rather than one on the wing. These persons will be leaders of
small enterprises, given to much planning and preparing rather
then executing or supervising. They will be competitive and
aspiring.
Most auspicious: He will be quite talented and very ambitious,
but circumstances will not favor him and he will be limited to
modest achievements. He will be restless and forceful, wasting
much of his energy. This will be reflected in his home life as well.
Least auspicious: He will imagine that he is cleverer than he
actually is, and will be vain and arrogant, believing himself
always to be in the right. He will engender disharmony, which is
likely to result in him living in isolation. Very few of his wishes
will be accomplished.
In yearly hexagram:

                             those who are sick.
Line 6 He exceeds his situation rather than just meeting it. The
flying bird passes him by. Misfortune.

These persons will have difficulty exercising proper restraint, as
they have a natural propensity to excesses and for overshooting
the mark. Constantly striving higher and higher, never knowing
or establishing acceptable limits, is detrimental to oneself and
others. The grass will never seem greenest, wherever they are.
Most auspicious: He will become unduly proud and arrogant,
through a false opinion of himself and his ability. He will never
see himself as others see him. He will be continually striving,
and ambitious, but by using wrong methods and by not correcting
his faults, that which he accomplishes will give empty satisfaction,
and any gains will later be lost.
Least auspicious: He will be insatiably covetous, and envious
of others. He will use his strength indiscriminately, and act
rashly, trying to force situations before they are ripe. His
accomplishments will be few and small, and he will have many
troubles, including frequent family difficulties.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         There is a danger that he will be

Hexagram 6J      Chi Chi   ==      After Completion


SIMPLE   TRANSLATION        OF TEXT
After Completion. Success in small matters. Good fortune at the
beginning. Disorder likely at the end.

COMMENTARY
Every line in this hexagram is in the right place, signifying that
matters have been brought to completion. With this completion
comes success. The good fortune comes at the beginning, when
the process of completion is still effective. A hexagram, however,
is not static, so by the time the top of the hexagram is reached,
and the lines are tending to change to their opposite, disorders are
likely to occur. This need not necessarily happen, if new ideas or
actions are injected to replace the old. This is what is implied by
'success in small matters,' i.e. when major accomplishments are
complete there invariably remain small matters to be taken care
of, and timely replacement of outworn details can keep a project
stabilized and successful. This naturally requires continual
3 / The Predictions
planning and forethought. In human affairs this should be done
with firmness and correctness, in great and small matters alike,
and in all realms, mental, physical and spiritual. One must bear
in mind the law of change: nothing ever remains stationary;
all things are either progressing or retrogressing, however
slowly. Those with this natal hexagram will exercise much
thought, and, in general, will plan well and know the right
things to do.
   Those born in the first month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING       LINES   (FROM    BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line   1   He brakes his wheels. His tail becomes wet. No error.

This line expresses the conditions at the completion of an enter-
prise. In I Ching, an important enterprise is usually signified by
the expression 'crossing the great water' (or 'stream'). Braking
one's wheels and slowing down keeps one from getting needlessly
wet when fording the great water. However, it seems that this
person is like a fox who gets his tail wet, and consequently has no
desire to cross the water again. With matters being completed,
it is right to rest and restrict one's activities. However, continued
analysis of one's situation is required to keep matters appro-
priately in hand.
Most auspicious: He will be knowledgeable and wise, and in a
high position. He will take adequate precautions against possible
calamities, nipping them in the bud whenever possible, or
helping to repair such conditions as may occur after natural
disasters. He may be in the legislative branch of government, or
associated with an insurance business. He will help keep his
country free from troubles. He will have a well-earned reputation
and a highly favorable life, and will be loved by many.
Least auspicious: He will be clever, but lacking in Common
sense and wisdom. He will often accomplish the wrong things.
He will vacillate frequently, and will have few achievements and
little lasting profit.
In yearly hexagram:
    Officer or official           He will be recommended for a
                                  responsible position.

  Ordinary people               By taking appropriate precautions
                                and keeping within normal limits,
                                he will have a reasonable year.
Line 2 The lady loses her carriage-window curtain. She should
not go in pursuit of it. It will return in seven days.

Modesty and reserve are indicated here. This is proper (the line is
weak in the correct place) as the period after completion has not
progressed very far as yet. When this period has served its
purpose, i.e. completed its cycle, as indicated by the words 'in
seven days,' then it will be time to recommence action. It is part
of this person's destiny that circumstances will not be propitious
for great achievements until late in life.
Most auspicious: He will be knowledgeable, wise and virtuous,
and will follow the golden mean. His ability and goodness will
not be appreciated, and consequently will remain unused. He
will persevere along the right path, and his diligence and patience
will in time be duly rewarded. In his senior years he will reap
the benefits that he could not attain earlier, and he will establish
much of merit, as well as achieving fame and wealth.
Least auspicious: He also will have wide and sound knowledge,
and will be stable and reliable in whatever he does. He will have
many hardships early in life, but will have modest yet sufficient
affluence in his old age.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          The year will be adverse at first,
                                but easing later.
   Business and professional He can expect losses or set-backs at
                                first, then gains later.
   Ordinary people              He will have difficulties at first,
                                but things will be easy later. Those
                               less auspicious may die.
Line J The Illustrious Ancestor carries out an attack on the
 Devil's Region, and conquers it after three years. Inferior men
 must not take part in such an undertaking.

Although the principal gains have already been made, many
problems of detail still remain to be overcome and set right.
This will be done. However, those in power are cautioned to use
only duly qualified and reliable people if they expect to receive
                                                                  +21

continuing satisfaction. Furthermore, they must be properly led,
by giving the right guidance and by allotting appropriate duties
and responsibilities. Maintaining successful operations is not easy.
Basically, this line relates to the way people are employed by
others once a major enterprise has been completed. Those
depicted here will, by and large, be the employers.
Most auspicious: He will be well educated and brilliant, but
lacking to a degree in common sense, and hence he will take a
long time to truly establish himself. He is likely to become a
military commander, or be in charge of a law enforcement
agency. He will have a good family and household, but will not
enjoy an extended family life.
Least auspicious: He will possess and express resentment about
not being given the jobs he believes himself capable of. He will
exercise cunning to try to get his way, and he may become
acrimonious and arrogant. He will often spend more money
than he has, and thus will frequently be in financial difficulty.
He will have many troubles and disputes with his own family.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          If in the military, he may be sent
                                into combat. If a diplomat, he may
                                be sent overseas. Other officials
                                will be assigned to trouble areas.
   Business and professional Progress will be very slow, in all
                                matters.
   Ordinary people              He should proceed slowly in all
                                matters, to avoid troubles and
                                lawsuits. If taken to court, he will
                                probably lose.
 Line 4 The finest clothes, torn to rags. Be mindful all day long.

Making repairs is indicated here. This is an essential part of any
activity or enterprise. These persons will be in high and important
positions, as indicated by their having the finest of clothes.
They will be forced to disperse their knowledge and personal
wealth to protect themselves and those dependent on them, as if
they were making rags out of their clothing and were stuffing
them into a crack to stop a leak in a boat. These persons will be
considerate, observant, forthright, magnanimous, noble and
chivalrous. Their lives will benefit many.

                                               5   I   The Predictions
Most auspicious: He will have great strength of character and
courage, and will employ them judiciously. He will be able to
achieve peace in times of danger, and likewise prevent calamities
in times of peace. HiS inner strength will be great, and he will
support others very ably at all times. He will have a very
favorable life, serving well his country, his family, his enterprises
and himself.
Least auspicious: He also will be a man of innate wisdom,
exercising caution and sound judgment. He will quell troubles
and disorders at their inception. He will achieve sufficient, but
not abundant, affluence.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will maintain his status, despite
                                the troubles surrounding him.
   Business and professional He will be well prepared for what-
                                ever is in store for him, and he
                                will not fail.
   Ordinary people              By being careful, troubles can be
                                avoided. When travelling by water,
                                he should beware of possible leaks.
Line 5 The neighbor in the east merits less benefit from his
sacrifice of an ox than does the neighbor in the west with his
simple yet sincere spring sacrifice.

Thankfulness for blessings received (in this case, when matters
have been brought to completion) was shown in ancient times by
performing sacrificial rites. Two very different modes of sacrifice
are depicted here, one person making a grandiose display by
slaughtering a valuable ox, while the other makes a simple yet
sincere offering in the spring ceremony (when the offerings
should be small, according to custom). Since God sees what is in
a man's heart, the simple offering sincerely rendered is much
more desirable than the elegant offering presented mainly for show.
Most auspicious: He will be careful and thorough, attentive to
detail yet far-seeing, broadminded and considerate. He will act
only after thorough deliberation, and then with singleness of
purpose. He will make many gains and reap the benefits of his
efforts, and he will always be of service to others. He will have a
highly satisfactory and rewarding life.
Least auspicious: He will be cunning and clever, and without
3   I   The Predictions
much honesty. He will seek luxury out of vanity, and will harm
many persons in his path, including his own family and house-
hold. He will have difficulty in all interpersonal relationships.
Only if he lives in seclusion will he truly enjoy life.
In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official          He may commit a grave mistake in
                               carrying out rules and regulations.

                               minor set-backs.
  Ordinary people              Large scale plans will fail. Small
                               schemes can be successfully a'.com-

                               move to or work in the west, but
                               unfavorable towards the east.
Line 6 His head gets immersed. Danger.

Returning to the idea that 'crossing the great water' means
carrying out some great enterprise, here we find a person trying
to accomplish something great on his own, and getting his head
wet. Obviously this indicates a dangerous situation. It is a basic
principle of human life that everyone should serve others in one
or more ways. Mutual support and cooperation are vital to success.
Regrettably, some, who are otherwise quite intelligent and
capable, will believe that they can accomplish major enterprises
best single-handed. They have lost sight of what it means to be
be a true leader.
Most auspicious: He will have great talent and a love of people.
Through exercising constant reverence and care he will accomplish
major achievements. At the same time, he will consider and be
wary of potential dangers and calamities. He will be slow to make
gains, but he will keep and protect what he attains, and will look
after his family.
Least auspicious: He will be talented and ambitious, but he
will also be vain and will regard himself highly. This will incur
the wrath of heaven and the opposition of man. Difficulty upon
difficulty will pile up, and he may die young.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will destroy himself profession-

becoming heedless, and proceed with caution.
2. Act with restraint,   and do not force activity. Matters will
commence at the right time.
3. Only that which is right should be attempted, and with strong
support, since considerable time will be required for its con-
summation.
4. People will test everyone and everything new. Watch out for
possible evil.
5. Actions taken with sincerity are ultimately more rewarding
than those done for show. Good fortune is on its way.
6. Do not glory in the past, or rest on your laurels; it is the

SIMPLE     TRANSLATION        OF TEXT
Before Completion. Success. The little fox gets his tail wet just
before the completion of his crossing. Nothing advantageous.

COMMENTARY
This hexagram is the exact opposite of hexagram 63, and every
line is in the wrong place. Success is augured by virtue of the
potential of each line to change, and thereby, through action,

                                                                     425
3   I   The Predictions
bring matters to a successful conclusion. The fox has always been
considered a wily and wary animal. When crossing a frozen
stream a fox will proceed carefully, listening for possible cracks.
Depicted here is a little fox, therefore one that is young and
inexperienced. Hence he is not sufficiently wary, and, just before
completing the crossing, in his hurry to get across, gets his tail
wet. The foregoing shows the possible courses of action before
completion. By being correct, by exercising care and prudence,
and by using one's potential wisely, success can be attained, and
is presaged. However, if one is like the young fox, then nothing
will be advantageous, no matter how carefully planned in
advance. The three lower lines, on the whole, relate to in-
adequate experience or insufficient inner worth to produce
great success, while the three upper lines bespeak favorableness,
and great things about to be accomplished.
   Those born in the seventh month will be more auspicious.

CONTROLLING         LINES   (FROM   BOTTOM    TO TOP)
Line    I   His tail gets wet. Humiliation.

Line 1 is a weak line, and implies a lack of experience, inner
strength, wisdom and prudence. These qualities, however, are
precisely those that are needed at the commencement of great
enterprises. Those persons who are innately good will be able to
sustain themselves moderately well, but those without any
strength of character will suffer appreciably. Their destiny is not
very favorable, and hence their timing will always seem to be
wrong whenever they try to accomplish something. In general,
it will be hard for them to achieve anything.
Most auspicious: He will possess considerable knowledge, but
he will be unable to accomplish worthwhile projects. He will be
what might be termed 'a dumb savant,' i.e. he will possess much
knowledge, but little practicality with which to put it to use. He
will find circumstances opposing his efforts to advance so often
that he will give up his ambitions and settle down to a simple
life, in which he will find contentment.
Least auspicious: He will have a generally unfavorable life,
from beginning to end. He will tend to quit everything he begins,
whether it be higher education, learning a trade, establishing a
friendship, developing family relationships, or whatever. He will

never be contented, and will always be searching, and he will
have many troubles.
In yearly hexagram:
  Officer or official        There will be impediments and
                             difficulties ahead, and he will be
                             unable to advance.
   Business and professional He will have small gains only, if
                             any.
   Ordinary people           There will be troubles in the
                             family business. He should be alert
                             to the possibility of drowning.
Line 2 He brakes his wheels. Firmness and correctness bring
good fortune.

Line 2 is strong, but since it is in the wrong place this person
should proceed slowly and carefully, following the right courses
and thereby bringing matters gradually to completion. Thus he
will attain good fortune. The results that these individuals achieve
will be by no means outstanding, yet they will be capable and
intelligent persons, respected in their chosen professions and in
their personal lives.
Most auspicious: He will be genteel, sincere and reverent in all
his thoughts, words and deeds. Fate will circumscribe his
activities and his achievements, but he will be respected by others
and will have many friends. He will be content with modest
accomplishments in both his profession and his personal life.
Least auspicious: He also will be a reverent, harmonious and
likeable person, who follows the golden mean. He will avoid
arguments whenever possible. He will have only modest achieve-
ments, but no shortage of material essentials.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He 'will overcome a major handicap
                               or difficulty, and will win favor.
   Business and professional Efforts towards advancement will
                               largely be blocked.
   Ordinary people             He should follow established pat-
                               terns for the best results, and wait
                               for a better time to try and pro-
                               gress. Troubles will readily develop
                               if he succumbs to rash ideas.
5   I   The Predictions
Line)   The situation has not been fully and correctly prepared.
Advancing brings misfortune. Advantageous to cross the great
stream.

The position of line g is such that although matters have partially
developed, an incorrect start has been made. Continuing on the
present path would lead to misfortune. It would be better, and
definitely advantageous, to start again, following the correct
principles and with adequate and worthy cooperation from
others, by the means of which any enterprise can be accom-
plished. A few of these individuals will learn exactly what needs
to be done for success, but they will be hesitant to put their
new-found theories into practice. The rest will continually make
mistakes.
Most auspicious: He will enjoy being led rather than leading.
He will avoid decisions as much as possible, and this quality will
keep him from progressing far intellectually. He would find it an
undesirable burden if he were assigned to a high position, but he
will gladly follow others, feeling that this is the path to harmony.
Least auspicious: He will be cunning and deceitful, and will be
in constant trouble with others. As it will be arduous for him to
advance, he will not try with any persistence. His home life will
be inharmonious, and he will have very few gains.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer Or official          He will possess inadequate ability
                                for his position, but if he receives
                                help he will be able to muddle
                                through.
   Business and professional Some proposals and attempts at
                                progress will fail.
   Ordinary people              He will have several difficulties.
                                Overseas business ventures should
                                be gainful, but home undertakings
                                will barely break even.
Line 4 Persistence brings good fortune. Regrets disappear. He
energizes his resources against the Devil's Country. After three
years, rewards are bestowed.

Line 4 is at the bottom of the trigram Li, clarity, and persons
born under this line see what needs to be done and begin to do it.

428
                                               5   I   The Predictions
The experience of line 5 enables them to follow correct principles
and this brings good fortune. Hence, any regrets over the course
they have chosen will disappear. These persons are more ad-
vanced (in terms of karma) than those born under line 3.
Consequently, they must carry out corrective measures as well as
progressive ones. This is never simple, and requires great per-
sonal courage, impartiality and persistence. In due course, their
efforts will be successful, and rewards will be bestowed on them.
Most auspicious: He will start life in modest circumstances. He
will obtain a good education, and will strive constantly to improve
himself, both personally and professionally. His persistence will
be rewarded by appointment to a high and influential position
late in life. He will then be favored by the leader. His home life
will be the envy of others.
Least auspicious: He will be in a position where he is responsible
for making corrections and reforms. He will cherish what is
right and good. He will receive help from his superiors, and
his strongest desires will eventually be fulfilled.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official          He will be placed in a high position,
                                and will receive a coveted award.
                                If in the military, he will be in
                                charge of a campaign.
   Business and professional New proposals and progressive
                                moves will be favored.
   Ordinary people              To profit this year one must gain
                                the help and cooperation of good
                                people.
Line 5 Persisting in firmness brings good fortune. No regrets.
The light of the superior man is true. Good fortune.

Even though line 5 is weak, there are several aspects favoring
it. It is the ruler of the hexagram, and the center of the trigram
Li, clarity (light). The inner hexagram is 'After Completion,'
where all the lines are in their proper places. In that hexagram
the ruler is line 2, because it is the proper correlate of the strong
line 5. Line 2 of the inner hexagram is also the center line of
trigram Li. Thus, even though line 5 here is weak, this man has
support and can advance persistently, making no major errors.
Being the heart of Clarity above, and supported by the heart of

                                                                   429
3   I   The Predictions
Clarity inwardly, makes his light lustrous and true. When a
man's inner light is true, external blessings follow; and that is
what transpires here.
Most auspicious: He will be a great administrator, selecting
highly qualified people to support his enterprises, and assigning
appropriate responsibilities within just and acceptable limits. He
will win the confidence and support of the people. He will
achieve a reputation through his ordinances and writings, and
will have a highly favorable life in all respects.
Least auspicious: He also will be a person of noble character and
shining virtue. The omens are highly favorable for a business or
professional career. He will be able to make large profits as well
as promote and develop his enterprise. He will have a good
family life as well.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official         He will be promoted.
   Business and professional He will make good gains. Written
                               work will receive special acclaim.
   Ordinary people             He will make good profits, and
                               strong desires will be fulfilled.
Line 6 Confidence reposed in him. Feasting without excessive
indulgence. If he allows his head to get wet, he forfeits this
trust.

This being line 6 indicates that something great is about to be
undertaken. Confidence and trust are reposed in the one who will
undertake the task. The people are gay and festive within due
limits, while waiting for the new situation to come into being.
If he gets his head wet, i.e. if he does not exercise inner strength,
wisdom and prudence, and follow the right courses, then he is
bound to forfeit the trust reposed in him. Some of these persons
will have the ability and strength of character to carry out their
responsibilities, while others will be weak and will succumb to
the temptations present in high positions.
Most auspicious: He will be knowlerlgeable, talented, wise,
courageous and practical, and will even possessthe ability to save
his country from disaster if necessary. His path and activities will
be ordained and blessed by heaven, and he will attain merited
fame and fortune.
Least auspicious: He will rise to a high position, but will be
                                              5 / The Predictions
morally and spiritually weak. He will be self-seeking, and will
over-indulge in sensual pleasures. He may even become totally
degenerate, and he will gradually be shunned by his peers, his
friends and his family.
In yearly hexagram:
   Officer or official       He will be promoted.
   Business and professional He will be advanced, and will make
                             gains.
   Ordinary people           Difficulties will be smoothed out,
                             and the year will be good. Older
                             people will reap some special
                             reward, relating to food.

4 I Compatibility



The selection of partners and companions
The basic principles of I Ching are as applicable to human
relationships as they are to philosophy, medicine, astrology and
other aspects of life. A man, as we have seen previously, can be
given certain trigrams that represent his character. The nature
of the year of birth also colours the character. Certain major
influences exist during anyone year, and determine the general
nature of persons born in that year. The compatibility or non-
compatibility of their respective yearly trigrams determines how
well two individuals are likely to get along with each other.
Hence, the selection of marriage (and other) partners, and com-
panions, will benefit from consideration ofthe trigrams involved.
   For the purpose of determining compatibility, the Later
Heaven Sequence of trigrams and the Magic Square of Three
(Figures 2 and 3, p. 10) are used as the base. The trigrams are
numbered as if the Later Heaven Sequence were superimposed
on the Magic Square. Since there is no trigram in the center of
the Later Heaven Sequence corresponding to the number five,
special studies had to be made regarding this number. From an

man the trigram K'un,
while the trigram Ken,
                            = =-=,
                              =,
extensive collection of data, the ancient scholars found that for a
                                 would be the most representative,
                                    would best apply to woman.
Thus we obtain the information shown in Table 21-
          Table   21   Trigrams for determining compatibility

                               4=   --                7=

• For a man, the trigram for 5 is
                                                      9=

                            =:::,
                                                                   tl.
woman. the trigram for 5 is       which is the tame •• for 8.

   Additional studies by the ancient scholars showed that com-

considered K'an,   = =;    Chen,    =.=; ==,
patibility is influenced by groupings of the trigrams. They
                                        Sun,        and Li,     ==,
            = =.
and K'un , - -, Tui ,        --,          =
                                  Ch'ien , -,    and Ken , --,
representatives of earth and metal, as the West natal group.
                                                                =-=
representatives of water, wood and fire, as the East natal group,
                             =.=.
In another sense, the groupings are: father, mother, youngest
son and youngest daughter in the West, and eldest son, eldest
daughter, middle son and middle daughter in the East. The
effects of the groupings in terms of compatibility are shown in
the tables below.
   It must be remembered, however, that as with the other
portents in I Ching, the auspices here can be challenged by the
use of one's free will, in thought and action. Consequently, from
observations, some matchings in life may not appear to agree
with the tables given below. The reality may be either better or
worse than the prediction, depending on the spiritual develop-
ment and attitude of the individuals concerned. The tables,
therefore, should only be considered as a general guide.
   On looking at the yearly number tables below, it will be noticed
that for the first year of the Upper Sexagenary Cycle, 1864, the
man's number is one, and the woman's is five. Five is midway
between one and nine. Furthermore, in the fixed magic square,
five works equally with all the other numbers. Man is assigned
the number one, because the male initiates action.
   Compatibility tables are given below the yearly number tables.
The rationale behind them can be ascertained by anyone desiring
to do so from the information given above. (See also pp. 11-15.)

4   I   Compatibility
For those wishing to examine the degree of compatibility further,
a comparison of the natal hexagrams should be made. Lines
which are of opposite polarity between the two hexagrams
enhance the potential compatibility. There can be from nought
to six such correspondences, and the higher the number, the
more favorable the omens. For example, consider Hexagrams 1
and 2. All the lines are opposite in character, so this situation
would be most favorable. However, if both individuals were
born under Hexagram 1, there would be no opposites, and little
compatibility. As another example, if the two natal hexagrams
are numbers 11 and 12 there is likely to be great compatibility,
because the Yangs and Yins are all in opposite places. The most
favorable pairings of hexagrams are given in Table 23. The
comparison of other natal hexagrams should be done on an
individual basis, comparing line 1 with line 1, line 2 with line 2,
etc., determining how many are of the opposite polarity, and
hence the degree of favorability.

determining partners. It should be mentioned that there are
several other methods for this purpose in Chinese astrologies.

However, the method described here is the only one relating to
I Ching. It should always be remembered that, as in other uses
of I Ching, the auspices of fate can be overcome by man's free
will, and the actions he takes.

    .tppendtx C / Applicability in the Southern
                            hemisphere



    At the time of writing the Astrology of I Ching the authors recognized
    that it was not directly applicable to the Southern hemisphere (see foot-
    note, p. 23). Nothing in the Ho Map Lo Map Rational Number manu-
    script revealed any firm statements        as to how it would be applied
    elsewhere than China. This, of course, was natural since the word China
    in Chinese means Central Country. Apparently this meaning was accepted
    quite literally by many. Thus little or no consideration      was given to
    those outside of China and especially not to those in the Southern
    hemisphere.     Recognition    of these facts led Dr Chu to do extensive
    research into the matter and his results are set forth below.
        Everyone knows that the Southern hemisphere is the counterpart
    of the Northern hemisphere, i.e, when it's summer in the north it's
    winter in the south; the circulation of the ocean and windstorm currents
    are reversed, indicating different influences acting on each area. While
    the applicable earthly hours remain the same for the same longitude,
    the point of reference for calculations in the Southern hemisphere must
    be a point diametrically       opposed to the point used in the Northern
    hemisphere. One of the first things this does is to offset the astrological
    year by six months from that in the Northern hemisphere, i.e. from
    what we call Summer Solstice to Summer Solstice in the Northern
    Hemisphere to what is known as Winter Solstice to Winter Solstice in
    the Southern hemisphere, roughly June 22 to June 21.
                e.g. 1929 astrologically is from June 22, 1929 to June 21,
                      1930 approximately     in the Southern hemisphere. Simi-
                      larly, 1978 is from June 22, 1978 to June 21, 1979
                      approximately.
        It will be noted too that the sexagenary" subcycles shown in Table 24

                  *   See p. 16 for the origin of the sexagenary   cycles.

                                                                             441

commence 'five' years later than those of the Northern hemisphere. In
actuality it is five and one-half years, as the astrological years start six
months apart.
    Since the Southern hemisphere is the counterpart        of the Northern
we must use opposites when considering the time and location in the
Southern hemisphere. Now the astrological year in the north is from
December 22 to December 21 approximately           whereas in the south it is
June 22 to June 21 approximately,     with the year in the south commenc-
ing six months later than the corresponding        year in the north (astro-
logically). In actuality then, for an 'A' year in the north the first half
will be an 'E' half-year in the south and the last half-year an 'F' half-year
in the south. By progression we see that the next 'A' year for the south
will be the astrological year 1929 or from June 22, 1929 to June 21,
1930. Further, the opposite of the Horary Branch symbol 'a' is 'g' so
an 'a' day in the Northern hemisphere is a 'g' day in the Southern. These
differences form the basis of the values in Table 24. The months are
calculated the same way in both hemispheres but their effect is opposite
(see Tables 5 and 25). The sidereal times are the same in both hemi-
spheres for the same longitude but the horary symbols may vary accord-
ing to the Celestial Stem used in entering Table 7.
    The method of calculation for obtaining the natal hexagram is the
same in both hemispheres. It is in the table values wherein a difference
occurs. The following steps will illustrate the appropriate methods:
I. Enter Table 24 with the appropriate astrological year (June 22 to
June 21 approx.) and determine the yearly and daily cycle values.
2.     Enter Table 2 and determine the sexagenary cycle value.
3.     Enter Table 1 and determine the numerical values for the yearly
cycle.
4. Enter Table 26 with the yearly Celestial Stem and determine the
monthly symbols.
5. Enter Table 1 and determine the values for the monthly symbols.
6. Add the daily value from Table 24 to the daily value from Table 6.
7. Enter Table 2 and determine alphabetical symbols for the numbers
obtained in step 6.
8. Enter Table 1 and determine the numerical values for the daily value
symbols.
9. Enter Table 7 with the Celestial Stem for the daily value and select
the symbols for the sidereal time of birth, i.e, time corrected for longi-
tude, daylight savings, etc.
