BOTH HEMISPHERES PARTICIPATE AND CONTRIBUTE TO ALL ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, THEY DO THE ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT WAYS. IN OTHER WORDS, BOTH BRAINS CARRY OUT
THE SAME FUNCTIONS BUT FUNCTION IN TWO DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT WAYS. BOTH BRAINS HAVE SEPARATE VIEWS AND PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD.

THE RIGHT BRAIN PRESENTS REALITY AS A UNIFIED WHOLE, WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE PEOPLE IN POWER HAVE SPLIT UP ALL THE FIELDS OF KNOWLEDGE INTO DIFFERENT
CATEGORIES WHEN IT IS ALL ACTUALLY ONE UNIFIED SCIENCE, WHICH IS DONE INTENTIONALLY TO KEEP US LEFT-BRAIN DOMINANT. ALL THINGS COME FROM THE ONE
THEREFORE ALL IS ONE. THIS IS WHY THE EGYPTIANS STATED "ALL IS ATUM," MEANING ALL IS ATOM, THE TORUS FIELD. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RIGHT BRAIN WOULD SEE A JUNGLE
AS A UNIFIED ENTITY, BUT THE LEFT BRAIN WILL SEE THE JUNGLE TREES AS SEPARATE BEINGS.

THE LEFT BRAIN'S PURPOSE IS TO ANALYZE AND BREAK DOWN THE UNIFIED WHOLE PRESENTED BY THE RIGHT BRAIN. THIS PROCESS IS DONE BY THE LEFT HEMISPHERE SO
THAT WE CAN HAVE DISTINCT SINGULAR FRAGMENTS OF REALITY SO THAT IT CAN MANIPULATE, MANAGE AND CONTROL IT. BOTH HEMISPHERES ARE NEEDED FOR US TO
FUNCTION WITHIN THIS CREATION; HOWEVER, WE MUST BALANCE THESE TWO ASPECTS OF THE BRAIN SO THAT WE DON'T BECOME LEFT OR RIGHT-BRAIN DOMINANT.

THE LEFT BRAIN MAINTAINS A SENSE OF DETACHMENT FROM THE DIRECT EXPERIENCE TO EXERT CONTROL OVER IT, WHILE THE RIGHT BRAIN STAYS IN THE PRESENT MOMENT
AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY EXPERIENCES IT. THE RIGHT BRAIN RELIES ON THE LEFT BRAIN BECAUSE ITS HOLISTIC PERCEPTION WHILE CAPTURING THE ESSENCE OF THE WHOLE
MAY LACK PRECISION AND CLARITY. THE LEFT BRAIN REQUIRES THE RIGHT BRAIN BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT PRODUCES MENTAL CLARITY, IT CAN LOSE SITE OF THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN ALL THINGS AND TRAP THE INDIVIDUAL IN A FRAGMENTED WORLDVIEW.



JOHN 21:6
“Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you will find fish.”
MOVE INTO THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE OF THE BRAIN AND YOU WILL FIND GOD/ UNIFICATION/ HIGHERSLEF.


MARK 16:19
“So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God”
RIGHT HAND OF GOD IS THE RIGHT HEMISPERE. HEAD IS HEAVEN, SAME ROOT WORD=HEA

THE BASE OF ALL PHYSICAL MATTER IS THE EATHER, ALSO KNOWN AS SPIRIT OR AETHER. IT IS A SUBSTANCE THAT IS
EVERYWHERE BUT NOWHERE AT THE SAME TIME. IT HAS ONE FOOT IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND IN THE ASTRAL
PLANE, IT’S ON EITHER SIDE. THE WORD ETHER IS EITHER.

THE ETHER IS INFINITE POTENTIAL THAT CONSTANTLY MANIFESTS AND UNMANIFESTS ITSELF CYCLICALLY. THE AETHER
IS THE HIDDEN ENERGY THAT VIBRATES TO CREATE THE “PHYSICAL WORLD WE SEE AND KNOW. WE ARE LIKE FISHES IN
AN OCEAN, SURROUNDED BY AN ENERGETIC FLUID SUBSTANCE THAT WE CAN SEE OR TOUCH. ALL THINGS ARE
FEEDING OFF THE ENERGY OF THE INFINITE ETHER.

THE 4 ELEMENTS ARE THE 4 VIBRATIONAL STATES OF THE ETHER.
-NONE OF THE ELEMENTS ARE PURE; THEY ARE COMPOSED OF EACH OTHER BY TRANSMUTATION.
 -ALL OF THE ELEMENTS ARE BORN FROM THE 1ST ELEMENT ETHER (SPIRIT).
-THE 4 PHYSICAL ELEMENTS ARE THE 4 VIBRATIONAL STATES OF THE ETHER. EARTH HAS THE SLOWEST VIBRATION,
AND FIRE IS THE QUICKEST.
-EACH ELEMENT SHARES ONE CHARACTERISTIC WITH THE ONE NEXT TO IT.

EVERYTHING IS MADE OUT OF ELECTROMAGNETIC TORUS FIELDS. ITS AN ELECTROMAGNETIC WORLD. THE EARTH IS THE HEART, MEANING THE
MIDDLE. THE MIDDLE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC COLOUR SPECTRUM IS GREEN. THE EARTH IS GREEN, AND THEN ABOVE THE GREEN EARTH IS THE
BLUE SKY. BLUE COMES AFTER GREEN ON THE LIGHT SPECTRUM.

THE WORLD WE SEE AROUND US IS ACTUALLY WITHIN US. WHEN WE ASTRAL PROJECT OURSELF OUTSIDE OF THE PHYSICAL BODY, WE ARE INDEED
LEAVING THE PHYSICAL PLANE WE CALL EARTH AND ENTERING THE ASTRAL PLANE. HEAVEN IS ABOVE EARTH, THROUGH THE BLUE SKY. THIS
CORRESPONDS WITH THE 7 MAJOR CHAKARAS WITHIN US. IN ORDER TO GO TO HEAVEN THROUGH THE BLUE SKY, WE GO THROUGH THE BLUE
CHAKARA TO OUR HEAD. HEAD AND HEAVEN ARE THE SAEM ROOT WORDS. YOUR HEAD IS HEAVEN BECAUSE IT IS THE PLACE OF THYNE
CONSCIOUSNESS/TRUE FORM.
