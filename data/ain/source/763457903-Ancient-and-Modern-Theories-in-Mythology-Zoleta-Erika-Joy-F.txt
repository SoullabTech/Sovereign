                         Ancient and Modern Theories


   Ancient Theories
   • Rationalism
        o Views reason as the chief source and test of knowledge.
        o The rational myth theory states that myths were made to better
            understand natural events and forces that occurred in the
            everyday lives of people.
        o This theory also explains that the gods and goddesses controlled all
            of these happenings of nature.
        o Examples are:
                ▪ Creation myths from different cultures: Creation myths explain
                   how man was created and explain what the gods and
                   goddesses used and what actions they took to create
                   humans. These myths also tell what substances were used (if
                   any) in order for man to exist.
   • Etymological Theory
        o Systematic study of birth, historical perspective, and time-to-time
            changes in the forms and implications of words (Ross, 1962).
        o Explains the origin of a word.
        o It can be said that words or names that are brought about by
            stories of myths come from some certain origins. Though some
            words or names have their meanings earlier before such stories are
            told, the meaning of these words or names change through the
            stories told.
        o For example:
                ▪ Aphrodite: You could explain the name of the goddess,
                   Aphrodite, by saying that she was born in sea-foam, since
                   aphros is the Greek word for sea-foam.
   • Allegorical Theory
        o Allegory is a word that has several specific meanings but in Greek it
            means that beneath the apparent meaning of a story is concealed
            another, more important meaning.
       o Allegory as a literary device or artistic form is a narrative or visual
         representation in which a character, place, or event can be
         interpreted to represent a hidden meaning with moral or political
         significance.
       o Myths as Allegories: Some theories propose that myths began as
         allegories for natural phenomena. Examples are:
             ▪ Apollo represents the sun;
             ▪ Poseidon represents water;
             ▪ Zeus was a sky god; and
             ▪ Demeter represents nature.
       o Myths as Allegories: Some myths began as allegories for
         philosophical or spiritual concepts. For example:
             ▪ Athena represents wise judgement; and
             ▪ Aphrodite means romantic desire;
•   Euhemerism
       o an approach to the interpretation of mythology in which
         mythological accounts are presumed to have originated from real
         historical events or personages.
       o This theory suggests that mythological narratives have a basis in
         actual historical occurrences.
       o Examples include:
             ▪ Heracles (Hercules): Euhemerists might interpret Heracles as a
                 historical figure, perhaps a strong and skilled warrior, whose
                 exploits were later exaggerated and mythologized
                 (Fontenrose, 1980).
             ▪ Gilgamesh: Euhemerists may consider Gilgamesh as a
                 historical king whose deeds were transformed into myth over
                 time, as discussed in various studies on Mesopotamian
                 mythology (see general references on Mesopotamian myths).
             ▪ Pharaohs in Ancient Egypt: Some proponents of Euhemerism
                 suggest that Egyptian pharaohs were deified over time, with
                 their accomplishments and reigns forming the basis for myths
                 surrounding gods and goddesses (Reference to relevant
                 studies on Egyptian mythology).
             ▪ Yu the Great in Chinese Mythology: Euhemerists might view
                 Yu the Great as a historical figure whose achievements were
                 later mythologized, though specific references will be
                 needed to support this interpretation (see studies on Chinese
                 mythology).
Modern Theories
• Naturalism
      o all myths are the result of an attempt to explain natural
         phenomena, often emphasizing the influence of environmental
         factors, geographical features, and the natural world on the
         development of mythological narratives. This perspective suggests
         that myths originated from observations and interpretations of the
         natural environment, and the characters and events in myths are
         symbolic representations of natural forces.
      o People who believe in this theory believe that myths can be traced
         back to the worship of the sun or moon.
      o Examples are:
            ▪ Creation Myths and Natural Phenomena: Many creation
                myths around the world involve natural elements such as the
                sky, sun, moon, and earth. For example, the myth of the Earth-
                Diver in various Native American cultures symbolizes the
                emergence of land from water.
            ▪ Fertility Myths and Agricultural Cycles: Myths related to fertility
                often revolve around agricultural cycles. The Greek myth of
                Demeter and Persephone, explaining the changing seasons,
                is an example of how natural phenomena are intertwined
                with mythological narratives.
            ▪ Animal Symbolism in Myths: Animals are frequently featured
                in myths, and naturalistic interpretations suggest that these
                animals may represent aspects of the natural world. The
                ancient Egyptian deity Thoth, often depicted with the head
                of an ibis, may be connected to the bird's association with
                wisdom and observation of celestial patterns.
            ▪ Topographical Influences on Myths: Some myths are linked to
                specific geographical features. Mount Olympus in Greek
                mythology is not just a fictional abode of the gods but an
                actual mountain, emphasizing the connection between the
                natural landscape and myth.
• Ritualism
      o According to this theory, all myths are created to accompany and
         explain religious rituals. They describe the significant events that led
         to a specific ceremony.
      o Ritualism theory in mythology posits that myths originated from and
         are intimately connected to rituals and religious ceremonies.
         According to this perspective, myths are not merely stories but serve
           as symbolic expressions of sacred rituals, reinforcing and explaining
           the beliefs and practices of a community. Ritualism theory suggests
           that myths have a performative aspect and are closely tied to
           religious rites, ceremonies, and communal activities.
        o For example:
               ▪ Cosmogonic Rituals and Creation Myths: Some creation
                  myths are closely tied to cosmogonic rituals, symbolizing the
                  act of creation itself. In Hindu mythology, the Rigvedic hymn
                  "Purusha Sukta" describes the sacrificial dismemberment of a
                  cosmic being, reflecting the ritualistic aspects of creation.
               ▪ Heroic Sacrifices and Mythical Narratives: Myths often feature
                  heroic figures engaging in sacrificial acts that parallel rituals
                  within a community. The Norse myth of Odin sacrificing
                  himself on the World Tree to gain knowledge and wisdom (as
                  found in the Prose Edda) can be interpreted through a
                  ritualistic lens.
               ▪ Fertility Rites and Agricultural Myths: Rituals associated with
                  fertility and agriculture are mirrored in myths that explain the
                  changing seasons. The Greek myth of the Eleusinian Mysteries,
                  connected to the story of Demeter and Persephone, is an
                  example of how rituals are intertwined with myths to convey
                  deeper meanings.
               ▪ Ancestor Worship and Hero Cults: Myths often feature heroes
                  who become the focus of ancestor worship and hero cults.
                  The stories of ancestral figures in Chinese mythology, such as
                  Houyi and Chang'e, are associated with rituals honoring
                  ancestors and celestial events.
•   Diffusionism
        o The diffusionists maintain that all myths arose from a few major
           cultural centers and spread throughout the world.
        o Diffusionism in mythology is a theoretical perspective that suggests
           the spread or diffusion of myths and cultural elements from one
           society to another through contact, migration, or cultural
           exchange.
        o According to diffusionism, similarities between myths in different
           cultures can be attributed to the sharing of ideas rather than
           independent development. This theory assumes a directional flow
           of cultural traits and ideas.
        o Examples are:
             ▪   Flood Myths: The presence of flood myths in various cultures
                 has been attributed to diffusion. For example, the biblical
                 story of Noah's Ark shares similarities with the Mesopotamian
                 Epic of Gilgamesh and the Sumerian flood myth, suggesting
                 possible cultural diffusion in the transmission of these
                 narratives.
             ▪   Creation Myths: The diffusionist perspective is applied to
                 creation myths that exhibit similarities across cultures. The
                 motif of a cosmic egg is found in creation myths from Hindu,
                 Chinese, and Polynesian cultures, leading some scholars to
                 propose diffusionist connections.
             ▪   Heroic Quests: The motif of a hero embarking on a quest or
                 journey is present in myths worldwide. Diffusionism has been
                 invoked to explain similarities between the hero's journey in
                 ancient Greek mythology (e.g., the Twelve Labors of
                 Heracles) and hero myths in other cultures.
             ▪   Trickster Figures: Trickster figures, characterized by their
                 cunning and mischievous behavior, appear in myths globally.
                 The diffusionist perspective suggests that the similarities
                 between characters like Coyote in Native American
                 mythology, Anansi in African mythology, and Loki in Norse
                 mythology could be the result of cultural diffusion.
•   Evolutionism
       o Myth formation occurs at a specific point in the evolution of the
           human mind. Myths are thus an essential part of all developing
           societies, and similarities between cultures can be explained by the
           relatively limited number of experiences available to such
           communities when myths emerge.
       o Evolutionism in mythology is a theoretical perspective that suggests
           that myths evolve over time in a manner analogous to biological
           evolution. This theory proposes that myths undergo gradual
           development, adaptation, and transformation in response to
           changing cultural, social, and psychological contexts. Evolutionism
           in mythology is often associated with the idea of cultural evolution,
           where societies are seen as progressing through stages of
           development.
       o For example:
               ▪ Solar Myth Theory: Evolutionism has been applied to theories
                  like the solar myth, where solar deities and motifs are seen as
                  evolving from primitive sun worship. The Egyptian god Ra, the
                 Greek god Apollo, and the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli are
                 considered examples of this evolutionist interpretation.
             ▪   Myths of Progress: Some cultures exhibit myths that convey a
                 sense of progress and development. For instance, the myth of
                 the Ages in Hesiod's "Works and Days" suggests a narrative of
                 societal decline and progress, reflecting an evolutionary
                 perspective on human history.
             ▪   Epic Heroes and Cultural Advancement: The development of
                 epic heroes in mythologies, such as Gilgamesh in
                 Mesopotamian literature or Achilles in Greek mythology, can
                 be interpreted through an evolutionist lens. These heroes
                 often embody qualities valued at specific stages of cultural
                 evolution.
             ▪   Shifts in Mythical Cosmogonies: Evolutionism can be applied
                 to the study of cosmogonies, where changes in creation
                 myths over time are seen as reflective of cultural evolution.
                 The shift from primordial chaos to more structured
                 cosmogonies in various mythologies is an example.
•   Freudianism
       o When Sigmund Freud, the founder of modern psychology,
          interpreted the dreams of his patients, he found great similarities
          between them and the ancient myths. He believed that the certain
          infantile are repressed (i.e. they are eliminated from the conscious
          mind but continues to exist within the individual in some other form.
          Sometimes, these feelings emerge into consciousness under various
          disguises, on of which is the myth.
       o Freudian theory in mythology, often referred to as psychoanalytic or
          Freudian mythology, is a perspective that applies Sigmund Freud's
          psychoanalytic ideas to the interpretation of myths. Freudian theory
          posits that myths are symbolic expressions of universal human
          desires, fears, and conflicts, often rooted in the unconscious mind.
          Key concepts include the Oedipus complex, the role of dreams,
          and the interpretation of mythic symbols as expressions of repressed
          desires.
       o Examples:
              ▪ Oedipus Complex in Greek Mythology: Freudian theory
                 interprets the Oedipus complex, which involves a child's
                 unconscious desire for their opposite-sex parent and rivalry
                 with the same-sex parent, as a universal psychological
                 phenomenon. The myth of Oedipus Rex in Greek mythology,
                  where Oedipus unknowingly fulfills a prophecy of killing his
                  father and marrying his mother, is often analyzed through this
                  complex.
              ▪ Phallic Symbols and Fertility Myths: Freudian theory suggests
                  that phallic symbols in mythology, such as the sacred spear or
                  pillar, can be interpreted as representations of male sexuality
                  and fertility. The myth of the god Attis in Phrygian mythology,
                  who castrates himself in a fit of madness, is one example
                  often analyzed from a Freudian perspective.
              ▪ Dream Analysis in Myth Interpretation: Freud's emphasis on
                  dream analysis as a means of exploring the unconscious has
                  led to the application of this method to the interpretation of
                  mythic narratives. The story of Joseph and his coat of many
                  colors in the Bible, with its dream motifs, is an example that
                  has been analyzed through a Freudian lens.
              ▪ Repression and Mythic Symbols: Freudian theory suggests
                  that mythic symbols may represent repressed desires and
                  conflicts. The motif of the serpent in creation myths, such as
                  the biblical story of Adam and Eve, has been interpreted as a
                  symbol of repressed sexual desire.
•   Jungian Archetypes
       o Carl Jung was a prominent psychologist who, while he accepted
          Freud’s theory about the origin of myths, did not believe that it went
          far in explaining the striking similarities between the motifs found in
          ancient stories and those of his patients. He postulated that each of
          us possesses a “collective unconscious” which we inherit
          genetically. It contains very general ideas, themes, or motifs which
          are passed from one generation to another and are retained as
          part of our human inheritance.
       o Jungian archetype theory, developed by Carl Jung, is a
          psychological framework that posits the existence of universal,
          innate symbols or archetypes shared across cultures and time
          periods. Archetypes are thought to reside in the collective
          unconscious and shape human experiences, including the creation
          and interpretation of myths. Jungian theory emphasizes the
          significance of mythic symbols and narratives as expressions of
          archetypal themes and motifs.
       o Examples include:
              ▪ The Hero: The Hero archetype represents the individual's
                  journey of self-discovery, facing challenges, and ultimately
                  achieving transformation. Examples include the hero's journey
                  of figures like Hercules in Greek mythology, King Arthur in
                  Arthurian legends, or Luke Skywalker in modern mythology
                  such as "Star Wars."
               ▪ The Shadow: The Shadow archetype encompasses the
                  darker, unconscious aspects of the psyche. In myths, villains or
                  antagonistic figures often embody the Shadow archetype. In
                  Greek mythology, figures like Medusa or the Minotaur can be
                  seen as manifestations of the Shadow.
               ▪ The Anima/Animus: The Anima and Animus represent the
                  feminine and masculine aspects within each individual,
                  respectively. In mythology, these archetypes may be
                  depicted through characters like Aphrodite representing the
                  feminine or Ares representing the masculine in Greek
                  mythology.
               ▪ The Wise Old Man/Woman: The Wise Old Man or Woman
                  archetype symbolizes wisdom and guidance. In various
                  myths, this archetype appears as characters like Merlin in
                  Arthurian legends, or the goddess Athena in Greek
                  mythology.
               ▪ The Self: The Self archetype represents the integration of the
                  conscious and unconscious aspects of an individual. In Hindu
                  mythology, the concept of Atman, the true self or soul,
                  embodies this archetype. Additionally, the idea of the
                  Mandala, a symbolic representation of wholeness, can be
                  viewed as an expression of the Self archetype.
•   Structuralism
        o This theory is a relatively new development that is closely related to
           linguists’ research. According to this theory, all human behavior,
           including how we eat, dress, and speak, is patterned into
           language-like codes. To grasp the true significance of myth,
           therefore, we must analyze it linguistically.
        o Structuralism in mythology is a theoretical framework that focuses
           on identifying and analyzing the underlying structures and patterns
           present in myths across different cultures. Developed by scholars like
           Claude Lévi-Strauss, structuralism seeks to uncover universal
           elements and relationships in myths, emphasizing the inherent
           structures that shape human thought and expression.
        o Examples:
              ▪   Binary Oppositions: Structuralism often analyzes myths in terms
                  of binary oppositions—pairs of opposing concepts or
                  elements that structure the meaning of a myth. In Greek
                  mythology, the opposition between gods and titans, order
                  and chaos, or life and death can be seen as structural
                  elements in various myths.
               ▪ Mythemes and Canonical Patterns: Structuralism identifies
                  mythemes, the smallest meaningful units in a myth, and
                  canonical patterns that recur across different myths. The
                  hero's journey, with stages such as the call to adventure, trials,
                  and return, is a canonical pattern found in myths worldwide,
                  such as the stories of Gilgamesh, Hercules, and King Arthur.
               ▪ Mythical Transformation: Structuralism examines the
                  transformation of elements within myths. The Greek myth of
                  Demeter and Persephone, for example, can be analyzed
                  structurally as a narrative of separation, initiation, and
                  reunion, reflecting broader themes of life, death, and rebirth.
               ▪ Elementary Structures: Lévi-Strauss proposed the concept of
                  "elementary structures" underlying myths, suggesting that
                  myths can be broken down into basic elements that are then
                  combined to form more complex narratives. The study of
                  kinship structures and myths surrounding marriage rituals often
                  exemplifies this approach.
               ▪ Myth as Language: Structuralism treats myths as a kind of
                  language with its own grammar and syntax. The analysis of
                  mythic narratives in terms of linguistic structures aims to reveal
                  the deeper meanings encoded in the myths. For instance, the
                  Norse myth of the Mead of Poetry can be examined for its
                  linguistic structures, emphasizing its role in conveying cultural
                  values.
•   Historical-critical Theory
       o According to this theory, there are numerous factors that influence
           the origin and development of myths, and no single explanation will
           suffice. Each story must be examined individually to determine how
           it began and evolved.
       o Historical-critical theory in mythology involves the application of
           historical and critical methods to the study of myths. This approach
           seeks to understand myths within their cultural, historical, and literary
           contexts, examining them as products of specific societies and
           periods. Scholars employing historical-critical methods analyze
            myths to uncover their origins, evolution, and the cultural influences
            that shaped them.
          o For example:
               ▪ Homeric Epics - "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey": Scholars using
                   historical-critical methods analyze the Homeric epics, "The
                   Iliad" and "The Odyssey," to understand their historical
                   context, authorship, and the cultural influences that shaped
                   these foundational works of Greek literature.
               ▪ Biblical Criticism: In the study of biblical myths, historical-
                   critical methods examine the texts of the Old and New
                   Testaments to determine their historical origins, authorship,
                   and the cultural and religious contexts in which they were
                   composed.
               ▪ Comparative Mythology: Historical-critical analysis is applied
                   to compare similar myths across different cultures and trace
                   their historical and cultural connections. For instance, the
                   flood myths in Mesopotamian, biblical, and other traditions
                   are examined to understand their shared elements and
                   divergences.
               ▪ Local Myths and Folklore: Historical-critical approaches are
                   employed to study local myths and folklore, exploring how
                   these narratives are shaped by regional histories, cultural
                   practices, and socio-political contexts. An example might be
                   the analysis of indigenous creation myths in North America.
               ▪ Evolution of Mythic Motifs: Scholars utilizing historical-critical
                   methods trace the evolution of specific mythic motifs over
                   time. The study of the transformation of the phoenix motif
                   across various cultures and historical periods illustrates how
                   myths adapt and change.
