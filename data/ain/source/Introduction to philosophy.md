**This article needs rewriting to enhance its relevance to psychologists.**  
Please help to improve this page yourself if you can.

The term **"philosophy"** finds its etymological origins in the ancient Greek word "Φιλοσοφία" (philo-sophia), which translates to "love of wisdom." In contemporary contexts, philosophy encompasses a broad spectrum of intellectual inquiries that hold significant relevance for psychologists. These inquiries revolve around fundamental questions concerning the nature of reality, the acquisition and validation of knowledge, and the principles guiding a well-lived life. Philosophical discourse is characterized by its reliance on systematic reasoning and critical thinking to construct compelling arguments and engage in meaningful debates on these topics. These dialogues often involve a careful examination of opposing viewpoints and an exploration of their perceived shortcomings.

In less formal language, the term **"philosophy"** can refer to an individual's overarching worldview or a specific ethical or belief system they adhere to.

Historically, the boundaries between philosophy and psychology were fluid, with psychology's subject matter integrated within the domain of philosophy. It is only in recent times that the relationship between psychology and philosophy has been redefined, with psychology emerging as a distinct scientific discipline.[1] However, the enduring relevance of philosophy to psychology is undeniable. While contemporary psychology is primarily associated with [empirical](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Empirical_research "Empirical research") research, particularly bolstered by evidence derived from cognitive neuroscience, philosophical inquiries, particularly in ethics and [epistemology](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"), continue to offer profound insights and guidance to psychologists.

One noteworthy aspect of this intersection is the philosophical exploration of the mind. Philosophers have long grappled with questions related to consciousness, perception, and the nature of mental states. These inquiries have laid the groundwork for modern psychology's investigation into cognitive processes, perception, and the study of consciousness.

Numerous prominent psychologists have contributed to philosophical discussions by authoring substantial textbooks that delve into key philosophical subject areas. These influential figures include [Dewey](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/John_Dewey "John Dewey"), [Fechner](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Gustav_Fechner "Gustav Fechner"), [Helmholtz](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Helmholtz "Helmholtz"), [James](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/William_James "William James"), [Kulpe](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Oswald_K%C3%BClpe "Oswald Külpe"), [McDougall](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/William_McDougall_(psychologist) "William McDougall (psychologist)"), [Stumpf](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Carl_Stumpf "Carl Stumpf"), [Ward](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/James_Ward "James Ward"), and [Wundt](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt "Wilhelm Wundt").[2] Their work has significantly enriched the interdisciplinary dialogue between psychology and philosophy, providing psychologists with a deeper understanding of foundational concepts and fostering a more holistic approach to the study of the human mind and behavior.

In conclusion, philosophy, as the pursuit of wisdom, remains an integral part of the intellectual landscape for psychologists. Its enduring relevance, historical intersections, and contributions to the understanding of the human mind make it a valuable resource and a source of ongoing exploration for those in the field of psychology.

## Branches of philosophy

There is no universal agreement about which subjects are the main branches of philosophy. The Aristotelian division was as follows:

1. First philosophy (metaphysics), of which the main area is [ontology](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") (the study of kinds of existence or being).
2. Cosmology. It is the study of the origin and nature of the universe.
3. Psychology. This is a much wider and more "philosophical" subject than the modern subject of the same name, encompassing the philosophy of perception, the theory of knowledge, and the nature of the soul (now similar to what is called "philosophy of mind").

Aristotle regarded ethics and politics not as parts of theoretical philosophy at all, but as practical disciplines. Logic he regarded as theoretical, but not as a science in its own right, since it is a necessary preliminary to all knowledge.

The modern classification, which originates with Christian Wolff, is into four main branches: 

- [Logic](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Logic "Logic"): What is truth? How or why do we identify a statement as true or false? And, how do we reason?
- [Epistemology](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"): Is knowledge possible? How do we know what we know? How do we take what is "known" to extrapolate what is "unknown"?
- [Ethics](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Ethics "Ethics"): Is there a difference between morally right and wrong actions (or values, or institutions)? If so, what is that difference? Which actions are right and which wrong? Are values absolute, or relative? In general or particular terms, how should I live? How is right and wrong defined? Is there an ultimate "ought"? Is there a normative value or objective that supersedes all others? Are values 'in' the world like tables and chairs and if not how should we understand their ontological status?
- [Metaphysics](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"): What is reality, and what exists? What is the nature of those things? Do some things exist independently of our perception? What is the nature of space and time? What is the nature of thought and thinking? What is it to be a person?
- [Aesthetics](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics"): What is it to be beautiful? How do beautiful things differ from the everyday? What is [Art](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Art "Art")? Does true beauty exist? It is often considered as a fifth branch, though it is also sometimes included with ethics as "[value theory](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Value_theory "Value theory")" in modern philosophy departments.

There are many overlapping issues between the categories.

These five broad categories are not the only areas of philosophical inquiry. [Politics](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Politics "Politics") (seen by [Aristotle](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") as part of ethics), [physics](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Physics "Physics"), geology, [biology](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Biology "Biology"), meteorology, astronomy, etc., were all originally part of philosophy. The Greeks, through the influence of [Socrates](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") and [his method](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Socratic_method "Socratic method"), developed a tradition of analysis that divided a subject into its components in order better to understand it. Use of this method is what made those subjects philosophical; and since many subjects made use of that method, the scope of philosophical material was wide. In addition, a number of subfields of philosophy have enjoyed contemporary focus and research (see the applied philosophy section).

## History of philosophy

Main articles: [History of philosophy](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/History_of_philosophy "History of philosophy"), History of Western philosophy, and [Eastern philosophy](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Eastern_philosophy "Eastern philosophy")

Traditionally, the history of western philosophy is divided into three areas: [Ancient Greek](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek"), [Medieval](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Medieval "Medieval"), and Modern. There is also now focus being put on the post-modern period, especially [existentialism](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Existentialism "Existentialism").  Étienne Gilson, in his book _The Unity of Philosophic Experience_, attempts to show important connections between the ideas of the medieval period and their development in the modern period; this is contrary to traditional interpretations of modern philosophy as a new era unconcerned with the past.

Ancient Greek philosophy is typically divided into the pre-Socratic Period, the philosophy of [Plato](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Plato "Plato"), and the philosophy of [Aristotle](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"). Important pre-Socratic philosophers include Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, [Parmenides](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Parmenides "Parmenides"), and [Heraclitus](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Heraclitus "Heraclitus").  [Socrates](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") and his pupil [Plato](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Plato "Plato") revolutionized philosophy. While Socrates wrote nothing, his influence survives through that of his pupil. Plato defined the issues with which philosophy still wrestles.

One of the greatest synthesizers of Christian and Aristotelian thought was [Thomas Aquinas](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas"). His synthesis of Aristotelian metaphysics and practical reasoning with Christian teaching became characteristic of [medieval philosophy](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Medieval_philosophy "Medieval philosophy"). 

[Descartes](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Descartes "Descartes"), who is often called the father of modern philosophy, proposed that philosophy should begin with a radical skepticism about the possibility of obtaining reliable knowledge. In his _Meditations_, he systematically destroys all the foundations of knowledge except one (I am thinking, therefore I am), and then uses this single indubitable fact to rebuild a system of knowledge.

The British Empiricists, [John Locke](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke") and the Anglo-Irish [George Berkeley](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/George_Berkeley "George Berkeley") and [David Hume](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/David_Hume "David Hume"), developed a form of [Scepticism](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Scepticism "Scepticism") and [naturalism](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy) "Naturalism (philosophy)") on roughly scientific principles. Hume was heavily influenced by empiricists [John Locke](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke"), [George Berkeley](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/George_Berkeley "George Berkeley"), [Isaac Newton](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), and Samuel Clarke.

[Immanuel Kant](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") wrote his _[Critique of Pure Reason](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Critique_of_Pure_Reason "Critique of Pure Reason")_ in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting views and establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysics rooted in the analysis of the conditions for the possibility of knowledge. 

By the late 19th Century, however, several important philosophers argued against the Kantians' skeptical attitude. One of the most influential was Edmund [Husserl](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Husserl "Husserl"), who founded the philosophical mode known as [phenomenology](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Phenomenology "Phenomenology").

## Philosophical traditions

The modern period in philosophy, beginning in the late nineteenth century to the 1950's, was marked by a developing schism in philosophy between 'Continental' tradition, which is mainly Franco-German, and the English and American 'Analytic' tradition.

Both traditions appear radically different, yet they have a common root, namely a rejection of the Cartesian and empiricist tradition that dominated philosophy since the early modern period, and particularly of the psychologism that pervaded the logic and method of Idealist philosophy.

What underlies the analytic tradition is the view (originally defended by Ockham) that philosophical error arises from misunderstandings generated by language. We imagine that to every word (e.g. 'baldness', 'existence') there corresponds something in reality. According to analytic philosophers, the true meaning of ordinary language sentences is, somewhat misleadingly, concealed by their grammatical form, and we must translate them into their true form (known as logical form) in order to clarify them. The difficulty, as yet unresolved, is to determine what the correct logical form must be. Some philosophers (beginning with Frege and [Bertrand Russell](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell")), have argued that first order logic shows us the true logical form of ordinary language sentences. Russell's _The Philosophy of Logical Atomism_ is an outline of such a project, Wittgenstein's _Tractatus_ is a more detailed attempt, although famously obscure and aphoristic.

Continental philosophy, in the hands of the phenomenologists such as [Edmund Husserl](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Edmund_Husserl "Edmund Husserl") and [Maurice Merleau-Ponty](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Maurice_Merleau-Ponty "Maurice Merleau-Ponty"), took a different turn, in its preoccupation with [consciousness](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness"). A fundamental assumption of this school is that mental phenomena have [intentionality](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Intentionality "Intentionality"), they have objects, external to and independent of the mind itself. Thus an important theme of phenomenology is an attack on the subject-object dualism of Cartesianism. 

Yet this is an assumption shared by analytic philosophers. A similar idea (though developed from a somewhat different starting point) is the view known as externalism defended recently by philosophers such as [John McDowell](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/John_McDowell "John McDowell") and Gareth Evans. This is that proper names ('Socrates', 'George Bush') refer directly to their bearers, and that their meaning is not mediated by any 'sense' or subjective meaning. Thus the thought 'Socrates is wise' has Socrates himself as a component, and thus there can be no question of our being radically mistaken as to the nature or existence of an external world. Such a mistake would make no sense – literally so, for if the question of whether the Eiffel Tower, London exists, were intelligible, we would have to admit the possibility that those names have no meaning, and thus that the question was not intelligible in the first place. This is strikingly similar to themes found in 'Continental' writers such as Heidegger, who argues that the 'scandal of philosophy' is not that the proof of the existence of an external world has yet to be given, _but that such proofs are expected and attempted again and again_. To have faith in the reality of the "external world", presupposes a subject which is worldless. But we are _embedded_ in the world.

## Other traditions

Members of many societies have considered philosophical questions and built philosophic traditions based upon each other's works. Eastern and Middle Eastern philosophical traditions have influenced western philosophers. Russian, Jewish, Islamic and recently Latin American philosophical traditions have contributed to, or been derivative of western philosophy, yet retain a distinctive identity.

The differences between traditions are often based on their favored historical philosophers, or emphases on ideas, styles or language of writing. The subject matter and dialogues of each can be studied using methods derived from the others, and there have been significant commonalities and exchanges between them.

Other philosophical traditions, such as African, are rarely considered by foreign academia. On account of the widespread emphasis on western philosophy as a reference point, the study, preservation and dissemination of valuable but not widely known non-western philosophical works faces many obstacles. 

Languages can either be a barrier or a vehicle for ideas. The question of which specific languages can be considered essential to philosophizing is a theme in the works of many recent philosophers.

### Western and Eastern philosophy

Main articles: [Western philosophy](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Western_philosophy "Western philosophy") and [Eastern philosophy](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Eastern_philosophy "Eastern philosophy")

Eastern philosophy follows the broad traditions that originated or were popular in [India](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/India "India"), Persia, the [Middle East](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East"), and [China](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/China "China")

Philosophical thinking also developed elsewhere, and can be seen in many ancient texts. In China, the _[Tao Te Ching](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching "Tao Te Ching")_ of Laozi and the _Analects_ of [Confucius](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Confucius "Confucius")both appeared around 600 BCE, about the same time as the Greek pre-Socratics were writing. In [India](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/India "India"), major philosophical texts include the _[Upanishads](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Upanishads "Upanishads")_and the _[Bhagavad Gita](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita "Bhagavad Gita")_, from circa 500 BCE (see [Hindu philosophy](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Hindu_philosophy "Hindu philosophy")). In Persia, Zarathustra's teachings which were a new basis for the Iranian branch of Indo-Iranian philosophy appeared around 900 BC. [Islamic](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Islam "Islam") civilization also produced many philosophical geniuses such as, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Rushd (Averroës), and Al-Ghazali (see Islamic philosophy).

At least since the publication of [Bertrand Russell](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell")'s _History of Western Philosophy_ the most prominent division of philosophy has been between the philosophies of the "West" and the "East". The western philosophical tradition began with the [Greeks](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Greek_philosophy "Greek philosophy"), while that of Asia originated, largely, in China and the Indian subcontinent.

### Applied philosophy

Though often seen as a wholly abstract field, philosophy is not without practical applications. The most obvious applications are those in [ethics](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Ethics "Ethics") – [applied ethics](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Applied_ethics "Applied ethics")in particular – and in [political philosophy](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Political_philosophy "Political philosophy"). The political philosophies of [Confucius](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Confucius "Confucius"), Kautilya, Sun Tzu, [Immanuel Kant](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant"), [John Locke](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke"), [Thomas Hobbes](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes "Thomas Hobbes"),  [Niccolo Machiavelli](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Niccolo_Machiavelli "Niccolo Machiavelli"),  [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau "Jean-Jacques Rousseau"), [Karl Marx](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx"), [John Stuart Mill](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill "John Stuart Mill"), [Mahatma Gandhi](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi "Mahatma Gandhi"), [Robert Nozick](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Nozick "Robert Nozick"), and [John Rawls](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/John_Rawls "John Rawls") have shaped and been used to justify governments and their actions. 

In the field of the [philosophy of education](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Philosophy_of_education "Philosophy of education"), progressive education as championed by [John Dewey](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/John_Dewey "John Dewey") has had a profound impact on educational practices in the [United States](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/United_States "United States") in the twentieth century.

Other important applications can be found in [epistemology](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"), which might help one to regulate one's notions of what knowledge, evidence, and justified belief are. [Philosophy of science](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science") discusses the underpinnings of the [scientific method](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method"). [Aesthetics](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics") can help to interpret discussions of [art](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Art "Art"). Even [ontology](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Ontology "Ontology"), surely the most abstract and least practical-seeming branch of philosophy, has had important consequences for logic and [computer science](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science").

In general, the various "philosophies of," such as [philosophy of law](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Philosophy_of_law "Philosophy of law"), can provide workers in their respective fields with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields. 

Often, philosophy is seen as an investigation into an area not understood well enough to be its own branch of knowledge. What were once philosophical pursuits have evolved into the modern day fields of [psychology](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), [sociology](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), [linguistics](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), and [economics](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Economics "Economics") (among others). [Computer science](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), [cognitive science](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science")and [artificial intelligence](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") are modern areas of research that philosophy has played a role in developing.
