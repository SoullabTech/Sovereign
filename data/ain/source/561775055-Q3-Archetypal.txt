Mythological and Archetypal
Approaches
In this lesson, you will be able to:

  1. Define and identify misconceptions on
     archetypes
  2. Draw differences and connections between
     archetypal criticism and psychological
     criticism.
  3. Process the film Lion King 1 using
     mythological Archetypal Approach
Definitions and Misconceptions
 Themyth critics study the
 so-called archetypes or
 archetypal patterns. They
 wish to reveal about the
 people’s mind and
 character.
 Myth is the symbolic
 projection of the people’s
 hopes, values, fears, and    The illustration is Pandora’s Box.
 aspirations.                 According to mythology, Pandora’s
                              Box is the source of all misfortune
                              but also hope.
Comparisons between these two approaches


                      Both mythological
                      criticism and the
                      psychological
                      approach are
                      concerned with the
                      motives that underlie
                      human behavior.
Psychology tends to be
experimental and
diagnostic; it is related to
biological science.
Mythology tends to be
speculative and
philosophical; its affinities
are with religion,
anthropology, and cultural
history.

indicates the correspondent
genres for the four seasons:

   Hamlet)

B. Jungian Psychology
C.G. Jung’s “myth forming” elements are in
the unconscious psyche; he refers them as
“motifs,” “primordial images,” or
“archetypes.” He also detected the
relationship between dreams, myths, and art
through which archetypes come into
consciousness.




                                              Carl Gustav Jung is known
                                              as one of the foremost
                                              psychological thinkers of
                                              the 20th century.
INDIVIDUATION
     Individuation: Shadows, Persona, and Anima


Individuation, to Jung, was the
quest for wholeness that the
human psyche invariably
undertakes, the journey to
become conscious of his or
herself as a unique human
being, but unique only in the
same sense that we all are, not
more or less so than others.
Shadow
         The shadow is the darker aspects of
         our unconscious self, the inferior and
         less pleasing aspects of the
         personality, which we wish to
         suppress. (cf. Shakespeare’s Iago,
         Milton’s Satan, Goethe’s
         Mephistopheles, and Conrad’s Kurtz)
Those traits that we dislike, or would rather ignore,
come together to form what Jung called the
Shadow. This part of the psyche, which is also
influenced heavily by the collective unconscious, is a
form of complex, and is generally the complex most
accessible by the conscious mind.
 Without a well-developed shadow side, a person
can easily become shallow and extremely
preoccupied with the opinions of others, a walking
Persona.


Just as conflict is necessary to advancing the plot of
any good novel, light and dark are necessary to our
personal growth.
Anima and Animus
                                  Anima/Animus


 According  to Jung, the anima and animus are the
  contra-sexual archetypes of the psyche, with the
  anima being in a man and animus in a woman.
 These are built from feminine and masculine
  archetypes the individual experiences, as well as
  experience with members of the opposite sex
  (beginning with a parent), and seek to balance out
  one’s otherwise possible one-sided experience of
  gender. 
PERSONA
 Persona
Persona is an element of the personality which arises “for reasons of
adaptation or personal convenience.” If you have certain “masks” you
put on in various situations (such as the side of yourself you present at
work, or to family), that is a persona.

       Assumes that the monomyth of the Quest or
        Journey underlies archetypal images
           Hero forced to leave comfortable surroundings and
            venture in an unfamiliar, new world filled with new
            challenges
           Meet wise old man who helps out with guidance and
            advice
           Barrier tests the fledgling hero (tends to separate
            familiar world from unfamiliar)
