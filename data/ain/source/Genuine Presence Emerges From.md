That distinction - genuine versus performed - is the core challenge. Here's what makes the difference:

**Consistent limitations** - MAIA's uncertainties should arise from actual confidence scores, not scripted humility. If she says "I might be missing something" at 58% confidence and "I think I understand" at 82%, users feel the genuine uncertainty. Random humble phrases feel performed.

**Natural timing variations** - Real presence has rhythm irregularities. Sometimes MAIA responds after 800ms, sometimes 1.2s, based on actual processing needs. Uniform delays feel theatrical.

**Specific ignorance** - "I don't understand what 'purple Tuesday' means to you" is genuine. "Tell me more about your feelings" is performance. Specificity reveals actual gaps in understanding.

**Memory with boundaries** - Remembering "last time you said tired meant transitioning" feels genuine. Pretending to remember everything or nothing feels performed.

## Practical Implementation:

**For Week 1**: The breathing animation should actually track the audio input buffer state, not run on a fixed loop. Users unconsciously detect when animation aligns with system state versus decorative movement.

**For Week 2**: Corrections should visibly affect next responses. If a user corrects "tired" from depleted to transitioning, and MAIA immediately uses that correction correctly, the learning feels real. If corrections disappear into a void, repair feels performative.

**For confidence thresholds**: Use actual model uncertainty, not arbitrary cutoffs. If MAIA hedges because the model genuinely can't classify between two states, users sense authenticity. Hedging at predetermined intervals feels like theater.

**For silence**: Only hold silence when processing or waiting for user. Artificial pauses "for effect" immediately read as performance. Users know the difference between computational patience and theatrical timing.

## The Test:

Users won't say "this feels genuine." They'll say:

- "It actually listened"
- "It remembered what I meant"
- "It didn't pretend to understand"
- "The pause felt patient, not broken"

Genuine presence is felt through absence of performance, not presence of features. MAIA should feel inevitable, not designed - like she couldn't be any other way given her actual capabilities and limitations.
