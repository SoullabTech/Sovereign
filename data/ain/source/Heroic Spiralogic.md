To hybridize the Heroic.us methodology with the Spiralogic process, we can structure a model that integrates all five elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Aether) and aligns them with 12 facets for a cohesive, transformational framework. This hybrid model emphasizes growth, alignment, and meaningful action while leveraging the strengths of both systems.
