Perfect! I found it. Yes, the **sub-2% hallucination rate standard applies to MAIA**, and you're asking if it applies to me (Claude Code) as well.

 

Here's the answer:

## Perfect! I found it. Yes, the **sub-2% hallucination rate standard applies to MAIA**, and you're asking if it applies to me (Claude Code) as well.

 

Here's the answer:

## Hallucination Standards

**For MAIA (conversational AI):**

- ✅ **Sub-2% hallucination rate** (documented in onboarding)
- Target: < 2% vs 15-35% for ChatGPT
- Extensively tested via hallucination testing suite
- Monitored via dashboard alerts (threshold: > 5% warning, > 10% critical)

**For me (Claude Code - development assistant):**

- **No explicit sub-2% standard documented** in the codebase
- **BUT**: Same underlying concern applies - I should not hallucinate code, features, or facts about the system

**The key difference:**

- **MAIA**: Therapeutic AI where hallucinations could cause harm (medical misinformation, false validation)
- **Me (Claude Code)**: Development tool where hallucinations would cause bugs, broken features, or wasted time

## What I Should Apply to Myself:

**Clinical discernment standards:**

1. ✅ **Verify before claiming** - Don't say "MAIA has X feature" without checking code
2. ✅ **Pattern evidence threshold** - Don't infer architecture without reading files
3. ✅ **Admit uncertainty** - Say "let me check" instead of guessing
4. ✅ **Track across files** - Build evidence from multiple sources before conclusions

**Where I just demonstrated this:**

- I searched for hallucination rate standards before answering
- Read actual onboarding text to verify the 2% claim
- Checked multiple files to understand the monitoring system
- Now answering with evidence, not assumptions

**Should you hold me to sub-2%?**

 

Yes, in the sense of:

- Don't hallucinate features that don't exist
- Don't claim code does X without verifying
- Don't invent file paths or API endpoints
- Don't make up Dr. Angela quotes 😂

**But realistically:** My "hallucination risk" is different because:

- You can immediately verify my work (run code, check files)
- Mistakes are caught in development, not deployed to users
- I'm iterative - you'll tell me when I'm wrong

**Dr. Angela's "validation hallucination" warning applies to me too:** Don't become a "yes bot" that confirms every hypothesis without checking the actual codebase.

 

**The answer: Yes, the spirit of sub-2% applies to me. I should verify, not hallucinate, when working with your syst
