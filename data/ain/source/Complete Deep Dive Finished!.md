  

  I've created a comprehensive exploration document:

  MAIA_COMPLETE_DEEP_DIVE.md

  

  This is a **massive** document covering ALL seven exploration areas you

  requested:

  

  1. Wisdom Framework Details (19 Frameworks) ✅

  

  - Complete breakdown of all 19 frameworks organized by Five Elements

  - 🜂 Fire: Alchemy, ACT, Existential

  - 🜄 Water: IFS, Polyvagal, CFT, Compassionate Inquiry

  - 🜃 Earth: Schema, NARM, DBT, Spiralogic

  - 🜁 Air: Gestalt, CBT, Constellation

  - 🜀 Aether: Somatic, Astrology, McGilchrist, EMDR, Eco-Therapy

  - Cross-framework synergy patterns (transformation signatures)

  - Awareness-level adaptation system

  

  2. Safety & Crisis Pipeline ✅

  

  - Multi-level detection (language, coherence, behavioral, signature)

  - 3-tier response protocols (Critical, High Urgency, Moderate)

  - Crisis resources integration

  - Safety monitoring over time

  - What MAIA never does

  

  3. Memory & Context Systems ✅

  

  - Hybrid memory architecture (Supabase + mem0)

  - What MAIA remembers (message/session/user level)

  - Context building (wisdom facets, birth chart, soulprint, journals)

  - Insight threading & convergence scoring (0-100)

  - Archetypal threading (Calling → Engaging → Integrating → Embodied)

  

  4. Conversation Intelligence Engine ✅

  

  - The Four Pillars (Sacred Listening, Alchemical Awareness, Somatic

  Intelligence, Meeting Them Where They Are)

  - Triple Body Wisdom (Polyvagal + Levine + Gestalt)

  - Conversation flow tracking

  - Adaptive response generation (6 variables)

  - When to speak vs hold silence

  

  5. Spiralogic System (12 Focus States) ✅

  

  - Complete breakdown of all 12 facets across 4 elements

  - Brain mapping (McGilchrist integration)

  - Astrological house correspondences

  - Each phase with recognition patterns and MAIA responses

  - Shadow integration (13th facet)

  - Dialectical wisdom (machine + cultural layers)

  

  6. Platform Features Deep Dive ✅

  

  - **TransformationalPresence**: Breathing entrainment, automatic state

  detection, biometric integration

  - **Mirror Field Journaling**: 5 modes (Freeform, Elemental, Shadow, Pattern,

  Integration)

  - **Unified Insight Engine**: Cross-context awareness, convergence scoring,

  archetypal threading

  - **Sacred Scribe**: Living mythology co-authorship

  - **Consciousness Field Map**: Visual constellation (planned)

  - **36 Faces Astrology**: Living birth charts, Spiralogic mapping

  

  7. Voice Synthesis System ✅

  

  - Voice principles (never force utterances)

  - Allowed vs forbidden patterns

  - Utterance emergence engine (0.7 threshold)

  - Natural flow examples

  - Quality control & cleaning

  - Voice modulation (planned)

  **What's Next?**

  

  You said **"b then c"** - meaning:

  1. ✅ **Review exploration** (Option B - DONE)

  2. ⏺ **Proceed with integration** (Option C - READY)

  

  **I'm ready to implement Phase 1 of the Intelligence Integration when you** 

  **are!**

  

  This will connect all of MAIA's rich systems (19 frameworks, active

  listening, safety, memory) to the UnifiedIntelligenceEngine for real-time:

  - Coherence tracking

  - Signature detection

  - Journey trajectory

  - Predictive intelligence

  - Personalized framework effectiveness
