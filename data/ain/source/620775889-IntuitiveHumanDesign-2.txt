      A Little About Me &
        This Mini-eBook
I have written this from a place that intends the
Highest Good, as I see the Perfected Potential of
the Human Design Bodygraph, as part of my 6th
color Perspective; these coming from my
Envisioning, NN in gate 41. There are many who
share from other Perspectives to guide those
who may need their medicine. We each attract
to us those who resonate with our Frequency
and are on our Fractal.

We have all of the chart so when you embrace
Oneness, you transcend the chart through
integrating it first, then the wisdom gained
blossoms and others are attracted to your
fragrance.

                           Continued on next page...
When I was still seeking and searching outside of
myself, I drank in a bunch of knowledge and
information. When I stopped seeking and searching
outside of mySelf, I stopped inhaling the knowledge and
information. All that knowledge and information
dropped off and the deeper inner wisdom seeded and
grew, blooming into a fragrant blossom that attracts
those ready to draw from my deep inner wisdom.

This is an example of the Mutable Signs in Astrology
consisting of Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces. In
Gemini we're gathering information, lots of data, that's
not sorted just yet. This massive inhalation of
information is then sorted through Virgo so we can
discern what resonates within us, which leads to our
inner truth in Sagittarius. As we let go of old truths that
we believed to be true for us, that no longer serve us, all
that which came before drops and the seeds of wisdom
from Pisces spring up and grows until it blossoms into
our deep inner wisdom.

Human Design is like mind candy, and the mind loves to
figure out complex things. In this section I'm sharing
different ways of creating a MyStory to help you
embrace weaving together a MyStory for yourself,
using the new Keywords in the previous section.

My Desire (3rd Color Mind) is for you to weave together
your Gate Keywords in whatever creative way that
inspires you. I also encourage you to take any or all of
these Keywords and look up other words you may
prefer to use, such as synonyms & antonyms. Whether
you create something with them or only contemplate
on them, it's the right way for you. Easy Is Right is my
Mantra (My GK Life's Work 10).

I like to play with the Keywords to create different
MyStorys. You can do this with as few or as many
elements from your Human Design chart. The sky's the
limit! Allow your mind to expand beyond limitations
and play creatively with your imagination.
This first example shows perfectly how I created this
ebook using two of my own gates...

Gate 60 the Architect: the architect is building the
structure within any perceived limitation through
realism. Bringing forth high ideals into the material
plane through creating a structure to anchore it.

Gate 41 Envisioning: envisioning the material to cover
the structure created and anchored in gate 60.

After the structure is brought into form, then it's time
to envision the materiels needed to cover the
structure we're bringing into form.....or dress it up, like
this ebook I've created.

The ebook format & Canva are the structures, the
limitation is doing it on my phone instead of a
computer and the design is what I envisioned for it.
