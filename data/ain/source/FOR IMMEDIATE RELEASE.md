The |R|evolve platform integrates ancient wisdom with modern technology, offering a comprehensive operating system for coaches, therapists, healers, and consultants that will streamline client analysis, resource management, client education, and peer collaborations.

As the personal development and coaching market becomes increasingly crowded, |R|evolve stands out by uniting the diverse offerings in the industry, making it the go-to destination for professionals and individuals alike. The platform is built around the Spiralogic model, a unique approach to psychospiritual growth and development that addresses the specific needs of clients at every stage of their journey.

The Organizational App, a key feature of the |R|evolve platform, allows users to visually organize and develop strategies in each of the 12 key arenas of development, functioning as a powerful tool for both self-development and professional practice. This innovative solution provides professionals with the ability to engage their clients with tailored information, tools, and activities, all while fostering a collaborative environment.

|R|evolve's curated database site will offer resources in each of the 12 key areas from a diverse array of systems, practices, methods, and models, ensuring that all members can deepen their understanding and practical skills to support their clients' needs. The platform is designed to scale from individual clients to full certification programs, enabling members to create a successful online practice.

The |R|evolve platform is backed by the extensive experience and expertise of Soullab's founder, Kelly Nezat, who has been in private practice since 1989, specializing in energy healing, bodywork, shamanic/spiritual healing, hypnotherapy, NLP, Taoist Chi Kung, Qigong, and Taoist shamanic healing. Kelly holds a BA in developmental psychology and has studied clinical/developmental psychology at Suffolk University, Boston and completed a practicum at Harvard Beth/Israel’s Mind Body Institute in Boston. 

With the upcoming launch of |R|evolve, Soullab aims to drive a cultural transformation by harnessing the power of ancient wisdom and modern technology. The platform's goal is to create a learning and teaching environment where professionals can share their wisdom with those seeking help and growth, supporting the evolution of every soul.
