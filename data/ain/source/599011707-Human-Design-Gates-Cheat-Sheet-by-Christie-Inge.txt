There is so much more where that came from.

The map is a made just for you, 100+ page digital guide that covers your
type + strategy, authority, profile, and all four gates of your incarnation
cross. And since knowing your design is only as valuable as your ability to
apply it in your life, it also includes ongoing and unlimited access to Q + A,
coaching, and leading-edge deconditioning tools.
