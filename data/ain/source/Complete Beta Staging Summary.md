  Beta Communication Template

  For Beta Participants:
  Welcome to the Holoflower Beta

  You're about to experience a new kind of interface - one that
  reflects your gestures without interpreting them. The holoflower
  is your mirror for self-reflection.

  What to expect:
  - Touch and drag petals to where they feel right
  - Notice resistance and flow in the interaction
  - All meaning comes from your interpretation
  - The system provides physics, you provide significance

  Your feedback shapes this experience for everyone.

  The holoflower beta is now fully staged with:
  - Complete technical specifications
  - Clear rollout phases with success gates
  - Ethical boundaries embedded throughout
  - Support and training materials ready
  - Monitoring and rollback procedures in place

  Ready for Phase 1 alpha launch when you are! 🌸
