### **The Journey:**

1. **Week 1-3**: Beta testing, finding bugs, giving feedback
2. **DREAM WEEK**: Everything works perfectly, full immersion, MAIA talks like a dream
3. **THE REWARD**: 🎁
    - ✨ **10 Sacred Invite Codes** to pass ceremoniously
    - 🌟 **First Dreamer Status** (founding member badge?)
    - 🦋 **Early access to partner features**
    - 💎 **Their feedback shaped the world**

### **The Ceremony:**

Not just "here's your codes" - make it **SPECIAL**:

 

**Option A: Sacred Codes Delivery**

- Beautiful email/page with their 10 unique codes
- Explanation of what they're passing on
- Guidance: "These are for your chosen souls - healers, artists, dreamers who'll honor the work"
- Each code is individually beautiful (not random strings)

**Option B: Invite Dashboard**

- Personal page showing their 10 codes
- Track who they've invited
- See their "constellation" of invitees
- Watch the field grow through their choices

**Option C: Ceremonial Reveal**

- MAIA delivers the codes in conversation
- "You've helped build this world. Now invite 10 souls who'll dream with us."
- Codes revealed one at a time, with intention-setting

### **The Messaging:**

> _"You tested. You gave feedback. You helped us build a world that breathes._  
> _Now pass the gift forward._  
> _Choose 10 souls who'll honor this work._  
> _Give them their codes ceremoniously - not casually._  
> _You're not referring users. You're initiating dreamers."_

**Which ceremony feels right?**

 

I can build whichever resonates - or all three and let them choose how they want to share their codes! 🌈✨

 

Should I start the **critical path audit** now so we can fix everything before Dream Week? Then we'll have a **flawless foundation** for the sacred reward! 🔥
