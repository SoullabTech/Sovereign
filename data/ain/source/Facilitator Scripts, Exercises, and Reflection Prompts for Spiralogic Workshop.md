### **1. Facilitator Scripts**

#### **Opening: Setting the Tone (10 Minutes)**

- **Objective**: Introduce Spiralogic, build rapport, and outline the workshop goals.
- **Script**:
    - _“Welcome, everyone! Today, we’re diving into the Spiralogic framework, a powerful tool for navigating change. This framework uses five interconnected phases—Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Aether—to help us address creativity, emotions, practicality, clarity, and purpose during change initiatives.”_
    - _“Our goal today is to explore these phases and apply them to the specific challenges we face as leaders and teams. Let’s start with a quick icebreaker to get to know each other and our perspectives on change.”_
- **Icebreaker Prompt**:
    - _“In one word, how do you feel about change? Why?”_

#### **Phase 1: Fire – Igniting Vision (45 Minutes)**

- **Objective**: Inspire participants to think boldly and creatively.
    
- **Script**:
    
    - _“The Fire phase is all about big, bold thinking. Change often feels daunting because we focus on limitations. Instead, Fire invites us to imagine what’s possible without constraints.”_
    - _“We’re going to use a Vision Mapping exercise to define our central goal for the change and brainstorm creative ways to achieve it.”_
- **Exercise Instructions**:
    
    1. Present the Vision Mapping Template:
        - _“In the center of the template, write down the main goal of your change initiative.”_
        - _“In the surrounding branches, list opportunities, potential innovations, and actions that could bring this vision to life.”_
    2. Encourage collaboration:
        - _“In your groups, share your ideas and build on each other’s suggestions. Don’t worry about feasibility yet—this is the time for creative freedom!”_
- **Reflection Prompt**:
    
    - _“What excites you most about the vision you’ve created?”_

#### **Phase 2: Water – Emotional Processing (45 Minutes)**

- **Objective**: Foster empathy and build trust by addressing resistance.
    
- **Script**:
    
    - _“The Water phase focuses on emotions. Change impacts people differently, and understanding these emotional dynamics is key to building trust and reducing resistance.”_
    - _“We’ll use an Empathy Mapping exercise to explore how stakeholders might feel about this change and how we can address their concerns.”_
- **Exercise Instructions**:
    
    1. Present the Empathy Mapping Template:
        - _“In each quadrant, write down what you think stakeholders might feel, what their concerns might be, what they need to feel supported, and how we can address those needs.”_
    2. Group discussion:
        - _“As you fill out the map, think about specific groups or individuals—what do they need to feel included in this process?”_
- **Reflection Prompt**:
    
    - _“What’s one insight from this exercise that surprised you?”_

#### **Phase 3: Earth – Planning and Stability (30 Minutes)**

- **Objective**: Create a practical plan with clear steps and responsibilities.
    
- **Script**:
    
    - _“The Earth phase grounds us in action. It’s where bold visions and emotional insights are transformed into practical steps for implementation.”_
    - _“We’ll use an Implementation Planning Template to identify key tasks, assign responsibilities, and set timelines.”_
- **Exercise Instructions**:
    
    1. Present the template:
        - _“List the main tasks required to achieve your vision. For each task, assign a responsible team member, set a deadline, and identify any resources you’ll need.”_
    2. Encourage prioritization:
        - _“Which tasks are most critical? What can we accomplish quickly to build momentum?”_
- **Reflection Prompt**:
    
    - _“What challenges might arise in executing this plan, and how can we prepare for them?”_

#### **Phase 4: Air – Clarity and Communication (30 Minutes)**

- **Objective**: Ensure clear messaging and establish feedback loops.
    
- **Script**:
    
    - _“The Air phase is about clarity. Clear communication is essential for aligning teams and ensuring everyone understands the purpose and steps of the change.”_
    - _“We’ll use a Communication Clarity Checklist to craft key messages and identify how we’ll gather feedback.”_
- **Exercise Instructions**:
    
    1. Present the checklist:
        - _“Draft your core message about this change. Who needs to hear it? What’s the key takeaway? How will you collect feedback?”_
    2. Role-play:
        - _“Practice delivering your message to a partner and ask for feedback on clarity and tone.”_
- **Reflection Prompt**:
    
    - _“What feedback mechanism will be most effective for your team?”_

#### **Phase 5: Aether – Alignment and Reflection (30 Minutes)**

- **Objective**: Align the change initiative with purpose and reflect on long-term impact.
    
- **Script**:
    
    - _“The Aether phase ties everything together. It’s about ensuring our actions align with our values and understanding the broader impact of the change.”_
    - _“We’ll use a Ripple Effect Map to visualize how this change will influence the organization, employees, and stakeholders over time.”_
- **Exercise Instructions**:
    
    1. Present the Ripple Effect Map:
        - _“In the center, write the immediate actions you’ll take. In the next ring, list the direct impacts on teams and processes. In the outer ring, identify long-term outcomes and how they align with your organization’s mission.”_
    2. Reflect collectively:
        - _“How does this map connect your actions to your values?”_
- **Reflection Prompt**:
    
    - _“What’s one long-term impact of this change that inspires you?”_

- **Objective**: Summarize key insights and prepare for implementation.
    
- **Script**:
    
    - _“Thank you for your participation! Today, we explored how Spiralogic’s phases—Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Aether—can guide us through change.”_
    - _“Take some time to reflect on what you’ve learned and think about how you’ll apply these tools in your work.”_
