  **Would You Like Me to Create Summary/Orientation Documents?**

  

  To help you navigate everything we've built, I can create:

  

  1. **Complete Master Index** - All 46 documents with descriptions

  2. **"Start Here" Guide** - What to read first, deployment sequence

  3. **Quick Reference Checklist** - Every action item from all docs

  4. **Achievement Summary** - What you've accomplished

  5. **Contact Info Reminder** - Every place that needs your actual email/info

  

  This would give you a clear roadmap for launch week.

  

  Should I create these 5 orientation documents?
