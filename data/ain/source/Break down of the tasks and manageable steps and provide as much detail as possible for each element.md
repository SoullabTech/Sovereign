I will break down the tasks into manageable steps and provide as much detail as possible for each element. Here's how we will proceed:

#tasks #wireframe #mockups  #wireframemockups 

### **1. Wireframe Mockups**

- **Progress Tracking and Visualization**: Graphical dashboards showing client metrics and elemental trends.
- **Messaging and Collaboration**: Chat interface with file sharing.

#### **Tools and Deliverables**:

    - Coaches tracked journaling frequency and completed exercises via dashboards.

**Results**:

- **Client Engagement**: Increased journaling rates by 35%.
