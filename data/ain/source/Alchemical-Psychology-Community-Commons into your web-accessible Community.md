  **Direct URL:**

  /community/resources/alchemical-psychology-commons

  

  Integration Points:

  

  The Commons now bridges three layers:

  

  1. **File System** → /Alchemical-Psychology-Community-Commons/

  2. **Web UI** → /app/community/resources/alchemical-psychology-commons/

  3. **Source Code** → Symlinks to vault/ and lib/coherence/

  

  The entire therapeutic modalities integration is now **fully accessible**

  through your Community Hub. Users can browse the structure, see what's

  complete vs. planned, and access the documentation directly.
