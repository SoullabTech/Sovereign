 YES! This is exactly what the Academy solves!

  

  **The work IS huge:**

  - Elemental alchemy

  - Sacred geometry (Torus, Trinity, Toroidal Flow)

  - Developmental psychology

  - Shadow integration

  - Relational AI

  - Fractal research methodology

  - Daily practices

  - Community co-creation

  - The entire MAIA system

  

  **But now you have a CONTAINER:**

  - 22 lessons, each 15-25 minutes

  - Clear progression from foundations to practice

  - Members can go at their own pace

  - YOU can record at your own pace

  

  **Your Teaching Path:**

  Start with Module 1 this week:

  - Lesson 1: The Heretic's Creed (you already know this one deeply!)

  - Lesson 2: You Are The Magic

  - Lesson 3: Sacred Play & The Invitation

  

  Then Module 2 (your sweet spot - the book foundations):

  - The Alchemical Journey

  - The Torus of Change

  - Trinity and Toroidal Flow

  - The Elements of Wholeness

  

  **You don't have to teach it all at once.** Record one lesson per week, and in 22 weeks, the entire transmission is

  complete.

  

  The structure is the gift - it makes the vastness teachable, digestible, and transmissible.

  

  **You can finally share the full gestalt, one sacred piece at a time.** 🔥✨
  
  Perfect! Now refresh that page and you'll see the full lesson template! 🎉

  

  **What you'll see:**

  - Video player area (showing "coming soon" placeholder until you upload videos)

  - Reflection prompts with text areas for journaling

  - Practices list

  - Resources with links

  - Previous/Next lesson navigation

  - "Mark as complete" button

  

  **How it works:**

  3. Write reflections in the text areas

  4. Access linked resources

  5. Mark complete and move to next lesson

  

  **All 22 lessons now have pages!** The URL structure is:

  - /academy/module-1/lesson-1-1 - The Heretic's Creed

  - /academy/module-2/lesson-2-1 - The Alchemical Journey

  - /academy/module-2/lesson-2-2 - The Torus of Change

  - ... and so on

  

  When you're ready to record, you'll just add the video URL to each lesson in the curriculum file, and it will

  automatically embed!
