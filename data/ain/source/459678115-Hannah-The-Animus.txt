BARBARA H a n n a h w a s a s t r a i g h t f o r w a r d , m o d e s t , y e t
grand w om an, a lover o f literature, a close affiliate and friend
o f both C arl Gustav and E m m a Jung, and of M arie-Louise von
Franz. She was a firs.t::.gener.ation Ju n gian psychologist, a m em ber
o f the Psychological Club o f Zurich (1 9 1 6 to the p resen t), and
amongjthe first lecturers of the |uiig Institute in Zurich. She lec-
tu red both in S'f]-tzerland and En glan d and w rote several books
on C. G. Jung and Jungian psychology.
   Barbara H annah’s psychological analysis of the animus is p re-
sented here in two volumes. T h ese essays have been gleaned from
Barbara Hannahs handwritten notes, typed manuscripts, previ-
ously published articles (as well as the handwritten notes o f those
articles), h er own drafts o f her lectures, and the notes taken by
 participants at those lectures. B arbara. H annah_tackledjhe _them e

_Hterature*. H er insight and vigor stem d ire cly from a peisonal
 grappling with her own animus while integrating the experience
 and reflection o f many from the first and second generations of
psychotherapists working directly with C. G. Jung.
   T he main objective of these two volumes is to present the
read er with an all-inclusive synthesis o f the many and complex
essays and lectures Barbara H annah presented on the them e of the
animus while remaining as close as possible to the original texts.
Authenticity and com prehensiveness have been set as the priori-
V III             The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



ties in the editing o f this work. But when lengthy passages repeat
themselves identically from one presentation to the next, synthesis
has been pursued. F o r example, Barbara Hannah discusses the
animus in the case o f th e sixteenth-century nun Jeanne F e ^ in
five different lectures and publications presented in these two
volumes. The th em e o f the animus in the Book o f Tobit is found
in seven lectures and essays. Some o f these lectures w ere given at
th e C. G. Jung Institute in Zurich, others w ere presented to various
audiences in Switzerland and England. Naturally, a great deal of
the material in h er later lectures was repeated from earlier works,
and much of this repetition is verbatim . I f every single sentence
that she ever w rote on the animus was published ch ron oloically
with no editorial adjustment, these volumes would be burdened
with tedious repetition and b ecom e unmanageable in size, under-
mining the vitality of B arbara H annahs style and compromising
the vivaciousness o f the works themselves.
   Nevertheless, when the presentation o f a them e would be
negatively affected by such editing, repetition has been preserved
from one essay to the next. N ot one single idea uttered by the
author has been neglected. H and corrections, which she added to
the pages o f h er lectures and the drafts o f h er publications, have
been included directly in the text in order to render the straight-
forward m anner and unfussiness o f Barbara H annahs literary style.
        The editorial priority in these two volumes has been set to p re­
serve the excellence and comprehensiveness of h er work on the
animus— that most com plex and vexing them e— while rendering
the natural and wonderful spirit o f B arbara Hannah herself. It was
Barbara H annahs express wish that references and com m ents be
included as footnotes and not relegated to endnotes, and we have
respected this wish.

   C arl G ustav Jung regarded th e hum an psyche as belong-
ing to the m ost obscure and m ysterious realm s w hich we can
exp erien ce. W h en ev er Jung writes o r speaks o f the nature of the
hum an psyche, he relies above all on his personal observations
o f people. T h e anim a and the anim us, two o f Ju n g’s m ost well
known con cep ts, w ere developed through em pirical observation
and actual exp erien ce.

sonality, we are dealing with creative processes that are steeped

    in m ystery and can b e trnly grasped only by inner experience
    understood by Ju n g as “a p rocess o f assimilation w ithout which
    th ere would b e no understanding.” Ju n g thus considered such
    experience as the conditio sine qua non for bringing unconscious
    contents into con sciousness, truly understanding them , and
i gradually liberating on eself from th eir autonom ous, possessive
1 and irrational nature. Ju n g w rites in his m em oirs:

         To me there is no liberation à tous prix. I cannot be liberated
         from anything that I . . . have not experienced. Real libera­
         tion becomes possible for me only when I have done all that
         I was able to do, when I have completely devoted myself to
         a thing and participated in it to the utmost.


        C om p lete devotion to and participation to th e u tm ost in the
    “terrifying work on the anim us” ch aracterizes Barbara H annah’s
    lifelong struggle to co m e to term s with the unconscious,
    an A u sein a n d ersetz u n g th a t b egan in 1 9 2 9 w hen she began
    analysis with Jung an^ lasted nearly sixty years to h e r death in
    1 9 8 6 . This ch arism a df h e r w hole b ein g was evident and even
    palpable to those p eop le who w ere close to her. It is also m ani-
    fest w hen one reads certain parts o f h e r papers in this p resen t
    work. W h atev er B arb ara H annah said o r w rote on “the vitally
    im p ortan t arch etyp e o f th e anim us” was ascertained both from
    h er own subjective exp erien ce and from the actual exp erien ce
    of w om en she knew.
       Seen in this light, B arb ara H an n ah s truly creative writings on
    the com plex them e o f th e animus are a unique and m ajor con-
    tribution to analytical psychology. T h eir value lies in the fact that
    they stem out o f direct, personal, and original experience with
    the darker layers o f the psyche. B arbara H annah did not gloss
    over, avoid, or repress but chose the path o f experiencing uncon­
    scious processes to the full, which, according to Jung, is the only
    way to liberate oneself. She thus created an indispensable vase, a
    vessel to receive. the contents o f h er unconscious with E ros, that
    is, h er feeling relatedness.

   Through an honest and conscious confrontation with the
unconscious (dream analysis, active imagination, painting, Cre­
ative w riting) B a rb ara H annah im m ersed h erself in the inner
experience o f the pow erful a r c h e ^ ^ e o f the animus. As she once
stated: “It is out o f my own exp erience— this little island and
relatively firm p iece o f ground— that I am trying to w rite on the
problem o f the anim us.” Analytic p ra ctice teach es us that the
individual hum an being to w hom unconscious contents b eco m e
conscious through experience is u nited with th e im personal cen -
te r o f psychic w holeness thus m aking the exp erien ced ce n te r into
a spiritus re c to r, a driving force o f daily life.
    Various dream s o f and about B arb ara H annah indicate that at
th e en d o f h e r life she achieved as m uch natural w holeness as an
individual hum an being can attain in a lifetime. In such a state of
being, the anim us, as it was on ce e p e r ie n c e d by B arb ara Hannah
in an active im agination, transform s itself into th e h eart of the
chthonic spirit o f truth. In this form the animus is a m ediator of
the religious exp erien ce, a veritable m essenger o f “G od.” In the
words of M arie-Louise von F ra n z , the animus b ecom es “the wise
guide to spiritual truth . . . and th e incarnation o f m eaning.”

Editor's Note: This essay on "The Problem of Contact with the
Anim us" closely parallels Barbara Hannah's text which w as pub-
lished under the sarne title by the Guild of Pastoral Psychology in
1951.1 This present version, however, includes some additional
information found in her handwritten notes and preliminary drafts
but which did not appear in the Guild publication. The discussion
of Jean n e Fery, a nun from the sixteenth century, within this
essay is a highly abbreviated version of Barbara Hannah's exten-
sive analysis of this nun and animus possession, presented in
volume 2 of this work.

O ne often hears th e com plaint th at too m uch is said about the
th eory o f Jungian psychology and too little about how this theory
works out in everyday life. E v e n people who have b een studying
Ju n g s works for years com plain about this im balance. This con-
ce rn seem s •to m e particularly constellated at present, for it has
n ever been m ore obvious that invisible forces are at w ork which
hum an reason are totally unable to con trol.2As Jung has pointed
out tim e and again, the only place w h ere th ere is any hope o f our
being able to com e to term s with these forces is in th e individual.

denote the phenom enon o f “spirit” in w om en, and the contrast
betw een the fem inine soul (anim a) and the masculine spirit (ani­
mus) gives us a valuable hint as to the difference betw een these
two figures.
   In general the animus personifies the spirit in w om an while
the anim a represents the soul in man. In general we can say that,
at the m ore rudim entary leveis, th e animus in the w om an is the
p rod u cer of opinions w hereas the anim a in man produces moods.
But actually the p art o f the animus to w hich we can re act and with
w hich w e can make con tact is the m erest fraction o f th e entity o f
spirit in the w om an. In real life, w om en generally deal not with
the en tire anim us b u t with that p art o f the anim us which is mostly
an opinionating substitute for the depths o f the spirit. This would
be the spirit o f rationalization which indefatigably occupies itself
with making these opinions seem logical-— at least as seen from
the point o f view o f the w om an or o f the collective society.
   Since a great deal o f the animus lies initially in the realm o f the
unconscious, it is naturally entangled in the shadow, w hich is not,
however, the sarne as the animus. M uch o f the shadow consists
                    The Problem o f C ontact with the Animus                  ^      3




o f personal repressions or o f that w hich has been forgotten. This
m ore o r less corresponds to F re u d s co n cep t o f the entire uncon­
scious. Ju n g has noted that the unconscious is also the unfathom - fiAjtu.,
able wellspring o f creativity and ideas, the expression o f which
w e can glim pse in works o f literature, art, music, or dance; in
fairy tales and myths; in the prim itive, ancient, and contem porary
religions, and so forth. T h e shadow is m ore or less the first part
o f the unconscious which we en cou n ter w hen w e begin to take
n otice o f ou r inner, unconscious lives.
    O ne might say that when a m an takes up the problem o f his
anim a he is attem pting to fínd the “inherited collective im age o f
wom an [which] exists in a m an s unconscious, with th e help o f
which he apprehends the nature o f w om an .”3 At the sam e tim e,
he finds his own unconscious function o f relationship. T h erefo re,
in his search for the anima, th e goal of man is at bottom to find
th e function o f relationship w hich he has always p rojected onto
w om an. T h e goal o f w om an, on the oth er hand, is to find th e
“inherited collective im age” o f the spirit or mind which she has
always p rojected onto man. T h e m ind o f woman— inasm uch as
it is unconscious— is autonom ous and p rojected onto man to an
alm ost incredible extent, although she is usually totally unaware
o f this fact.
    T h e problem o f m od em w om an in this respect is m ost clearly
described in Ju n g’s article “W om an in E u ro p e ,” with ali the symp-
tom s which surround us on every side proving that the masculine
side o f wom an can no longer be den ied .4 In that essay, Jung says:


       Masculinity means knowing what one wants and doing what
       is necessaiy to achieve it. Once this has been lèamed it
       is so obvious that it can never again be forgotten without
       tremendous psychic loss. The independence and criticai
      judgment she acquires through this knowledge are positive

     values and are felt as such by the woman. She can never part
     with them again.5


If we are to avoid this “trem endous psychic loss,” we are obliged
sooner or later to face the problem o f th e animus.
   T he spotlight in this p resen t p ap er is definitely on the ani­
mus and not on the anim a, for it is only of th e form er th at I can
speak from direct personal exp erien ce (which is the only firm
ground one has w hen one com es to th e practical side o f such
them es). N evertheless, a good deal o f what is said also applies
to the anima, particularly in regards to th e technique for com ing
to term s with these figures. M y referen ces to Ju n gs article, “T h e
Relation B etw een the E g o and the U nconscious,” for instance,
are taken from a p lace w h ere Jung is speaking primarily o f the
anima. T he main difference that one m ust always keep in mind
is that a woman tends to re a ct with rigid opinions which go
irritatingly beside the mark w hereas a man is inclined to react
with moods o r with a peculiarly touchy vanity. In oth er words,
a w om an’s unconscious reactions are inclined to be those o f a
som ew hat inferior man and vice versa.
    It is only fair to say th at ali o f the Jungian psychology in this
p ap er naturally com es from Jung and is “begged, borrow ed or
stolen”! Undoubtedly the read er has read Ju ngs psychology infi-
nitely b etter p resented in his books than here. T h e tíiing that I
am attem pting to do then is to give a fragm entary report on how
it seem s to m e that Ju n g s ideas work out w hen w om en attem pt
to apply them in th eir own psychology.
   Now w hen a wom an writes o f th e animus, she is always up
against the fact that the animus him self m ay have his own views
on the matter. Jung on ce pointed out in a sem inar that, whereas
portraits o f the anim a are exceedingly com m on in literature, good
portraits of the animus are very rare. H e thought this might be
because the animus to a great extent w rites the books o f w om en
him self and prefers not to give him self away. (The anima, on the
                 The Problem o f Contact w ith the Anim us               5




contrary, seem s to be rath er fond o f sitting for h er p ortrait!) Thus
w hen I w rite, I never feel quite sure how m uch the anim us, like a
wily old fox, is obliterating his tracks with his brush!


        T h e P r e d o m in a n c e o f t h e U n c o n s c io u s in
                          T H E P ER S O N A L IT Y
T h e First point on which we m ust ag reé before entering on our
th em e is the fact that the psyche reaches f a r b ey o n d our con ­
scious knowledge. T h e idea that w e are really the m aster in our
own house dies hard, and so be it with the pem icious slogan:
“W h e re th ere is a will, th ere is a way.” I em phasize this because
long after we have realized the existence o f both the personal and
collective unconscious and are quite aw are that w e have a shadow
and an animus or an anim a, we find ourselves behaving exactly as
if we did not know it at ali. It is not easy to shake off nineteenth-
centfiry rational ideas with which w e and our im m ediate forefa-
thers grew up and which flourish around us as never before.
    W h en it com es to realizing th at the psyche itseíf extends far
beyond our ego and its conscious knowledge, w e are eonfronted
with the realization that we live, in p art, in an unknowri, invis-
ible country. T h e re is indeed a g reat deal o f com parative m ate­
rial from which w e can gath er inform ation. T h e prim itives, for
instance, have at b est one leg in outside reality while th e other
stands in this invisible world. W h at they call the land o f the spir-
íts is indeed to them th e g reater reality o f the two, and studying
th eir ways o f dealing with th eir spirits can be com p ared to read-
ing a description o f the cou n tiy b efore undertaking a journey. W e
can also find com parative m aterial in m any other fields. I m en-
tion, for instance, tlie great religions, o f both the E a st and W est,
the G nostic system s, alchem y, and, on a low er levei, w itchcraft
and m agic.
    W e .may say, however, that ali secondhand accounts..of .what
Ju n g ealls the collective unconscious have only a relative value.
T h ey are absolutely invaluable in amplification and com pari-
son, but the condtio sine qua n o n o f any real knowledge o f the
unconscious is actual experience. It can n ot be em phasized too
6            The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



often that psychology is an em pirical science. Jungian psychology
is frequently m isunderstood as a philosophy or even a religion,
bu t always by people who have had no experience o f the kind
them selves and who th erefore find reports o f oth er p eop le’s
actual experience so strange th at they assum e it m ust be a m at-
te r o f philosophical or m ystical speculation. T hey are m ore or
less in the position o f people listening to an explorers account o f
som e strange tribe w hose habits are so different from their own
that the listener m ay involuntarily find him self thinking: “H e is
pulling the long bow” o r “fisherm ans tales!” Som e people go
even further and, w hen som ething from th e unconscious catches
them and forces them to exp erien ce it, th ey think they are seeing
“white m ice” or, like th e co m m en t o f th e man when he first saw
the duck-billed platypus: “Why, th ere ain’t no such bird.”


Yet, we have not veiy far to seek to find evidence that we are
m oved by things within ourselves which differ from ou r conscious
personality. How often do we say, “W h at possessed m e to do
th a t?” O r we are angry with ourselves because we have done the
exact opposite from that which we intended. Yet, som ehow we
hate to draw the logical conclusion and even doubt the evidence
o f ou r own senses rath er tlian face the alarm ing fact that th ere
are “things” within us that can a ct independently and oblige us to
carry out “their” intentions.
   T he following incident m ay illustrate the difficulty of admit-
ting unusual facts. A storm on the Lake of Zurich on ce d etached
a floating public bathing raft from its m oorings at the upper end
o f the lake. It was on a w in ters night and it drifted right down
th e lake nearly to Zurich before it was discovered the following
day and tow ed back to its base. This p ecu liar incident was related
at a dinner party that night and á young wom an exclaim ed with

like her, we constantly miss the m ost obvious psychic facts due to
the sam e prejudice.
   In his sem inar on N ietzsche s Z arathustra, Jung on ce spoke of
the realization that m an does not only consist o f consciousness but
also o f the unconscious. And that o u r conscious will is constantly
being crossed by unconscious wills in ourselves. H e said:

       It is as if you were ruler of a land which is only partially
       known to yourself, king of a country with an unknown num-
       ber of inhabitants. You don’t lcnow who they are or what their
       condition may be; time and again you make the discovery that
       you have subjects in your country of whose existence you had
       no idea. Therefore you cannot assume the responsibility, you
       can only say: “I find myself as the ruler of a country which has
       unknown borders and unknown inhabitants, possessing quali-
       ties of which I am not entirely aware.” Then you are at once
       out of your subjectivity, and are confronted with a situation
      in which you are a sort of prisoner; you are confronted with
      unknown possibilities because those many uncontrollable
       factors at any time may influence ali your actions or decisions.
       So you are a funny kind of king in that country, a king who is
       not really a king, who is dependent upon so many unknown
       quantities and conditions that he often cannot carry through
      his own intentions. Therefore it is better not to speak of being
       a king at ali, and be only one of the inhabitants who has just
       a corner of that territory to rule. And the greater your experi­
       ence, the more you see that your com er is infinitely small in
       comparison with the vast extent of the unknown against you.6


    O n ce we have realized that w e are not the king o f our
psyche, not the m aster in o u r own house, we are— paradoxically
enough— in a m uch stronger position. W e have escaped from
o u r subjectivity, that is, we have gained a tiny piece o f objective
ground w here we can stand and look around us. A great deal that

belongs in our own inner world has always been in projection. Ali
those things which we do not see in ourselves are automatically
projected onto ou r environm ent. W e do not m ake projections, but
w e fin d pieces o f ourselves that we have not recognized projected
onto our environm ent.7 IIow m any o f us have a favorite bête
noire, a dark nasty beast, for instance, who conveniently carries
ali the qualities that we do not want to recognize as our own. As I
am sure you ali know, one does not p ro ject voluntarily. This obser-
vation is som ething which apparently one cannot rep eat enough,
for one continually m eets people who know quite a lot o f Jungian
psychology and yet still do not understand that we do not project
voluntarily; in fact, we do nothing o f the kind. W e simply do not
see som ething which is nevertheless a p art o f our own psyche.
Since at first it is com pletely foreign to us, we m eet it for the first
tim e in som eone else as a projection, and then slowly we becom e
aware o f its existence also in ourselves.8 It is nearly seven hundred
years since M eister E ck h art exclaim ed: “It is ali inside, not out-
side, for eveiything is inside.” B ut how few people have realized
as yet what he m eant.

W h en we exp erien ce the fact th at our conscious ego is only
an inhabitant in a small c o m e r o f a vast territory, we naturally
want to know som ething about the oth er inhabitants. As is well
known, before Ju n gs tim e the unconscious was mainly regarded
as repressed m aterial which could ju st as well be in conscious-
ness (insofar as it was recognized at ali). T h e latter is at least
theoretically true o f w hat Jung calls th e personal unconscious. In
its personal asp ect, the shadow has its hom e in this layer o f the
unconscious. It could th erefore be called ou r nearest neighbor
in the vast expanse o f the unknown that surrounds us. It is clear
that considerable knowledge o f the shadow is required before we

are in a position to take up our problem with the m ore distance
figures, including the animus.
    T h e shadow is a m inor figure in oneself, which is, in a way, the
negative im age o f the co n scious personality. O ne usually regards
it as som ething inferior and, in its m ost com m on form , it is com -
p osed o f ali the negative qualities w hich one does not w ant to see
in oneself. B u t, in the case o f people who are living below their
possibilities, the shadow can contain very positive qualities, “up to
eighty p erce n t pure gold,” as Jung on ce said.
    T h e personal shadow is not ali that difficult to recognize. True,
it can entail a long, weary, and an exceedingly painful undertak-
ing. B ut the real challenge com es from the contam ination o f the
shadow with th e figures o f the collective unconscious in the back-
ground. H ere is the great com plication o f the work. P eo p le with
a sensitive con scien ce who see th eir dark side will som etim es lose
th eir sense o f proportion and begin to m ake them selves respon-
sible for the devil himself! It is thus o f u tm ost im portance to leam
to discrim inate betw een the shadow in o n es personal sp here and
the great figures o f the collective unconscious surrounding us.9
   T h e figure which is nearest to th e ego and shadow is the anima
o r animus. Jung often speaks o f a kind o f m arriage betw een the
animus and the shadow, a com bination far stronger than the weak
conscious ego. In a sem inar given in 1 9 3 2 , he goes into this aspect
in considerable detail and points out that a w om an m ust be in
possession o f h e r shadow— that is, aw are o f h er inferior side— in
o rd er to be in a position to relate to h e r animus at ali. P eop le
who tliink they are just too m arvelously good and thus deny their
shadows altogether are as if possessed by devils. W om en then get
ali eaten up by the anim us, and the anim us, in a way, grows fat, he
is stren gth en ed by that excellent nourishm ent. H e gets so strong
that he can overrule the conscious personality. Thus the connec-
tion o f the. animus with the shadow should be broken despite the
fact that one arrives at the animus by way o f the shadow. In fact,
you can never arrive at the anim us unless you see the shadow,

unless you see your own inferior sides. W hen you see your shad­
ow, you can detach from th e animus, but as long as you don’t see
it, you have not a ghost o f a ch a n ce.10
     To put it still m ore simply: you have not got a ghost o f a ch an ce
while the animus and shadow a re m arried, for the gam e always
stands at two to one against the conscious ego. W e shall see in a
late m edieval case what it m eans psychologically to, b e “possessed
by devils,” and we shall also. return later to the role o f the shadow
in our problem of contact-w ith the animus.



         M AK IN C T H E ACQUAINTANCE W IT H T H E ANIM US
It is a well-known fact quite outside psychological circles that
the soul (anim a) o f man frequently p resents herself in personi-
fied feminine form . I m ention only D a n te s B eatrice, P etrarch s
Lau ra, and R ider H aggard s She. B ut the fact th at the spirit o f
wom an presents itself in m asculine form seem s to m e m uch less
well known. H ad anyone clearly drawn this conclusion until Ju n g
recognized this counterpart to th e anim a in the unconscious o f
w om en ?11 Now that w e have realized th e em pirical existence of
this figure, this spontaneous p ro d u ct o f the unconscious, we can
find traces o f it in m any places, albeit often in a negative form .
The dem ons that possessed w om en, for instance, w ere usually o f
the masculine sex. I m ention, for in stance, A sm odaeus, th e evil
spirit th at possessed Sarah in the Book o f Tobit and killed h er
seven husbands before Tobias, with the help o f th e archangel
Raphael, exorcised the devil by m eans o f th e h eart and liver o f
the físh. Or, for exam ple, the “little m aster” o f w ítches and the
“G rand M aster” o f th eir covens w ere alm ost always m asculine.
   T he fact that the Christian God, particularly the Protestant
God, is exclusively masculine presum ably m ade it m ore difficult
for woman than for man to recognize h er individual spirit, for it
was always projected, in its positive aspect, in the prevailing reli-

gion. This m ay be one o f many reasons why w om an realized the
existence o f h er m ale co u n terp art so m any centuries later than
m an. I m ention this in passing, b ut it would lead us too far from
o u r subject to continue this them e.
   It should be m entioned that, in earlier and m ore peaceful days,
w hen the unconscious poured smoothly into the prevailing reli-
gion, the great m ajority o f people could find the answer to ali these
questions— if indeed they w ere ever asked— within the tenets of
their faith. T h ere are people today whose unconscious still fits in
the fram ework o f som e established religion, and such fortunate
people should be disturbed on no account, for in these chaotic
days a real hold o f any kind in the invisible w orld is o f the greatest
value not only to themselves but also to their surroundings.
   I exp erien ced this vividly last autum n when I w ent to a
C atholic village in Switzerland for a w eekend. It contains an
unusual n u m ber o f rest hom es for C atholics, largely for monks
and nuns. I im m ediately exp erien ced a feeling o f the most
extraordinary p e ace in the village w hich I at first attrib u ted to the
herds o f cows, the m ountains, t)he autum nal leaves, and the m el-
low O ctob er sun. H ow ever, shortly before, I had spent m y holiday
in a place w here ali these things w ere p resen t w ithout experienc-
ing anything o f this unusual feeling o f inner security. T h e friend
I was with has considerable resistances to the C h u rch and was
mildly grum bling about the n u m ber o f priests and nuns we m et.
I was th erefore astonished to h ear h e r suddenly say: “I know why
it is so peaceful: th eir religion is really containing the unconscious
o f th ese people. T h ey are not split underneath a.s we a re .” But
desirable as this condition may b e, it is unfortunately today rather
th e exception than the rule. Particularly th e people who com e to
psychology are usually suffering from som e kind o f disharmony
within them selves. It is true that, in the m ajority o f cases, this dis­
h arm ony is p rojected onto the o u ter world. T h e difficulty is that
they cannot g e t on with th eir environm ent in som e form or other.
     I rem em b er Jung saying som e fifteen years ago, when he was-*'
still in the thick o f his p ractice, that a]m ost everyone cam e to him
for a different reason. In the m ajority o f cases, it sufficed to give
12               The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



help with the ou ter difficulties, to open up a new attitude tow ard
th em , for instance, o r to point out things that have been over-
looked. As he also em phasizes in his writings, it is only a com p ara-
tively small minority that is destined to tread the difficult inner
way o f com ing to term s with th e collective unconscious,12 that
jon gest o f ali paths, as th e alchem ists called it. It is this minority
whom I have in mind when I speak o f th e problem o f con tact with
th e animus. Jung notes that:


       only those individuais can attain to a higher degree of con-
      sciousness who are destined to it and called to it from the
      beginning, that is, who have a capacity and an urge for higher
       differentiation. In this matter men differ extremely, as also do
       the animal species, among whom there are conservatives and
       progressives. Nature is aristocratic, but not in the sense of
       having reserved the possibility of differentiation exclusively
       for species high in the scale. So too with the possibility of psy-
      chic development: it is not reserved for specially gifted indi­
      viduais. In other words, in order to undergo a far-reaching
      psychological development neither outstanding intelligence
      nor any other talent is necessary, since in this development
      moral qualities can make up for intellectual shortcomings. It
      must not on any account be imagined that the treatment con-
      sists in a grafting upon people’s minds general formulae and
      complicated doctrines. There is no question of that. Each can
      take what he needs, in his own way and in his own language.13


    O nce we have definitely realized that we have a shadow and
are no longer naively projecting ali ou r own bad qualities on our
unfortunate neighbors, and are also aw are that our consciousness
is only an “infinitely small c o m e r in com parison with the vast
extent o f the unknown against us,” we have gained a piece o f firm
ground from which w e can begin the task o f making the acquain-

tan ce o f o u r anim a 01* animus. On th e one hand, these figures
have a personal aspect so th at we can talk o f m y animus o r y o u r
anim a and, on the other, they are inhabitants o f the collective
unconscious so th at it som etim es seem s far m ore c o rre c t to speak
of the animus and the anim a.14 In quarrels betw een two w om en,
for instance, th e m atter often b eco m es hopelessly confused if
they m ake an attem p t to find out who was to blam e. And when
they first study psychology and begin inform ing each o th er that
they are quite willing to grant it was the o th e rs animus, th e m atter
usually goes from bad to w orse! B u t in tim e, when they can see
that th e w hole quarrel was arranged by the animus and that hoth
w ere m ore or less his victims, they can often gain a p iece o f objec-
tive ground from w hich a real understanding can be reached.
   In th e spring term o f 1 9 3 8 in his sem inars on Z arathustra,
Jung w ent into this m atter in som e d etail.15 H e was speaking o f
th e p rojection o f the dark side and o f seeing the devil p rojected
into som eon e else. H e pointed out that, in analysis, the patient
is gradually convinced th at he can n ot assum e Mr. So-and-So to
be th e ax-chdevil who can interfere seriously with his soul. B ut
th e first result o f seeing this p rojection is often introjection: the
patient assum es that h e him self is th e devil. N othing is gained
by this, for, o f cou rse, th e patient is not th e devil either; so the
latter— along with the projection— falls back into the sauce and
dissolves th ere. T h en th e analyst has to say: “Now look h ere, in
spite o f th e fact th at you say th ere is no terribíe devil, th ere is at
least a psychological fact w hich you m ight call the devil. If you
should not find a devil, then you had b e tte r construct one— and
quickly— before he dissolves in your own system ” and eveiything
to be gained by becom in g conscious o f y ou r shadow is lost.16 Jung
goes on to say that one m ust actually

speaking of Nietzsche‘s Zarathustra and pointing out that, as Nietzsche had constracted
the figure o f Zarathustra, the light aspect of the Self, he should have constructed a counter
shadow figure or tlie latter would—as indeed it did— fali into the “sauce” of his own psyche.
She adds that naturally there is always a certain danger in quoting passages out of their
context. Ed.\

           make a devil, say there is one, and if you doubt it, suppress
           your doubts as much as you can. For it is just as if you were
           building a house because you know you need one, and then
           conclude that there never was a house there and destroy
           whatever you have started to build; so of course you will
           never have a house. Therefore in order to construct a devil
           you must be convinced that you have to construct him, that
           it is absolutely necessary to construct that figure. Otherwise
           the thing dissolves in your unconscious right away and you
           are left in the same condition as before.17


   A belief in the personification o f evil p er se is found in almost
every form o f hum an society. A consensus gentium confirm s the
existence of som e form o f devil.18 I f w e do not allow for the real­
ity o f the figures o f the collective unconscious, we shall either
p roject collective forces onto our neighbors or introject them into
ourselves. T herefore it seem s to m e o f vital im p ortan ce to never
forget that the anim us— how ever personally we may take him— is
also a figure o f th e collective unconscious.
    In another seminar, Jung pointed out that as soon as a woman
begins controlling h er animus o r a m an his anim a they co m e up
against the herd instinct in mankind. M an s original state was one
o f overwhelming unconsciousness, and this condition still partially
persists in us ali today. As soon as we attem pt to liberate ourselves
from possession by the anim a o r animus we get into a different
o rd er o f things, and this attem p t challenges the old order. If one
sheep goes ahead o f the flock by itself, it is a th reat to the others
and thus will be ostracized and exposed to attack. M oreover, no
sooner do you get rid o f a devil than you have ali the devils against
you. If a man makes a m odest attem p t at controlling his anima, he
will be right away in a situation w here he is tested to the blood;
ali the devils o f the world will try to get into his anim a in ord er to
bring him back into the unconscious fold o f M other N ature. The

sam e with a w om an. E v ery devil circulating within one hu ndred
miles will do his best to get the goat o f h er animus.
   T h e truth o f these w ords will b e evident, I think, to any
w om an who has m ade a serious atte m p t to co m e to term s with
h e r anim us. T h e people in h e r environm ent are, on th e one
hand, fascinated by th e fact that she has gained a standpoint au-
dessus d e la m êlée, but, on the o th e r hand, their unconscious—
particularly th eir animi— is irritated by th e fact th at som ething
has b een done con tra naturam . T h e refo re she often finds h erself
exposed to the m ost u n exp ected attacks, usually o f a very irra-
tional nature.
   W h en w e first face th e fact, however, that w e are only co n ­
scious o f a small c o m e r o f our psyche and that we have to reckon
with another will— or o th er wills— in ourselves, we usually feel we
are up against a m ultitude, a confusion that is hopelessly bewil-
dering. T h e greatest help in this confusion usually com es from
dream s, and h ere it is o f the greatest value to turn to the experi­
en ce o f oth er people in ord er to le a m w hat is already known
about this dark unknown realm in w hich our consciousness is set
líke a small island o f light.
    It is obvious th at th e animus— as a figure with both indi­
vidual and collective characteristics— ris particularly suitable to
b e a liaison officer, so to speak, b etw een consciousness and the
unconscious. It is tru e that as w e first le a m to know him , he usu­
ally seem s to have little inclination to play such a helpful role.
This depends quite a Iot on individual conditions. A w om an with
a positive relation to h e r father, for instance, usually has a certain
subjective readiness, th at is, an innate psychic stru ctu re for posi­
tive exp erien ce with th e m ale sex and with the animus. B u t this is
often com pensated later in life with a peculiarly devilish animus
w hose existence she has overlooked. T h e thing w e m ust never
forget in dealing with the animus is that he is dual, he always has
a negative and positive asp ect (a fact that, o f cou rse, also applies
to th e anima).
    A w om an I m et som e years ago had a m ost helpful animus fig­
ure whom she called “Archibald.” She never did anything without
   i6              The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



  Consulting this figure. At first, she certainly seem ed in a m ost envi-
  able position. H e always knew the right way even out of the most
  desperate situations, and when I once heard a long account o f his
  exploits, I admit I was very m uch im pressed. Ali the sam e, one
  could not help feeling even then that she was becom ing too depen-
^ dent on this figure, and one o r two o f us tried to w am h e r that it
  would do as well to also put a question mark against the omnipo-
  ten ce o f Archibald. H e had, however, already gained far m ore
  iníluence over her than could be reach ed by any human voice,
  and she went on trusting h erself w holeheartedly to his guidance. It
  ended, as one m ight expect, in h er becom ing m ore and m ore pos­
  sessed by this figure whose previous positive effect b ecam e pro-
  gressively negative. H ad she been able to keep a criticai standpoint
  o f h er own from which she could have recognized the dual nature
  o f this figure, she would not have fallen into this trap.
       It may seem strange to the read er that any sane woman_could
  personify her unconscious mind or spirit to such an extent that
  she could consult him about h er daily life and allude to him as
  Archibald. (As w e ^hall see later, it is indeed open to question
  w hether she was wise to involve him so m uch in her daily life.)
  B u t as Jung points out so clearly in his ch ap ter on the anim a and
  animus in “The Relation B etw een th e E g o and the U nconscious,”
  the anim a and the animus do m ake them selves felt in such a way
  that one can best apprehend their reality by treating them as
j autonom ous personalities with a life and will o f their ow n.19Taking
  them in a very personal way helps us recognize their personality
  and makes it possible for us to make a relation to these figures.20
      The experience o f o th er p eople, as m entioned before, is usu­
  ally insufficient to convince us right away that we really have
  a personified unconscious m ind or spirit that is influencing us
  without our knowledge. T h erefore, w e should now briefly con -
  sider how we can catch the anim us at work in ourselves and thus
  experience him firsthand.

    Perhaps the m ost usual and least unp]eas£.nt way o f learning
to know our animus is through our dream s. Ir dream s h e usually
appears personified, and it is th ere that w e first le a m to regard
him as a person. T h e m any forms h e can take are well known,
both negative and positive, hum an and dem onic, anim al and
divine. H e very often appears as an authoritative figure, as a priest
or m onk, as a tea ch e r o r ruler. H e appears in dream s very often
as actual m en w hom w e know o r knew, as the father— the first
carrier o f his im age— or as the b rother, husband, lover, and so on.
(And h e is particularly fond o f telling us w hat we sh o u ld do and of
superim posing a netw ork o f opinions over our instincts.)
   T h e animus also very often appears as a plurality. Ju n g rnen-
tioned C hristina Alb e r ta s F a th e r by H . G. W ells m ore than once
in his sem inars as an excellent exam ple o f the way that th e animus
works in w om en .21 T h e girl does ali sorts of nonsensical things
duríng the day, but in the evening she holds a sort o f co u rt of
con scien ce that tells h er exactly w hat she has really b een up to.
This is a kind o f inexorable thinking which she can n ot get away
from and is a good illustration o f th e autonom ous working o f the
unconscious mind o f w om en. T h e parrot, Old Nick, in .G reen
D olphin C o u n try by Elizabeth G oudge, plays a sim ilar ro le .22 H e
is forever destroying M ariannes fictions about h erself and always
reappears with som e crushing rem ark just as she hopes h e has
succu m b ed in som e earthquake, war, o r fire.
   O ne o f th e techniques that Ju n g recom m ends for getting
acquainted with our animus is to keep a sbarp lookout on o u r
sp eech , in particular our thoughts, and to constantly question
th em as they pass through our minds: “D id I ihink th a t? ” “W h ere
did that thought co m e from ?” “W h o thought th at?” This is a most
disagreeable technique, and w e always find good excuses to avoid

 it, such as never having th e tim e, and so on. B ut if we can force
 ourselves to p ractice it and to w rite down the ou tcom e— for we
 forget such thoughts alm ost before w e think th em — the results
 can b e exceedingly instructive.
    T he place w here th e animus usually makes us m ost unhappy
  is when he interferes in our relationships. As m entioned before,
' the leading principie o f w om en and th e anim a is E ro s, and that
 of m en and the animus is Logos. W h ereas E ro s w ishes_to.join
 and unite, the Logos wishes to discrim inate and for. that-purpose
 to separate.. T h e animus, th erefore, can have an exceedingly
 severing effect. I f th e relationship— to the husband, analyst, or
 som eone else— is im portant enough to us, we shall suffer a great
 deal in this resp ect. B u t this also form s an invaluable incentive
 to investigate and discover the animus. F o r it is often just here,
 in the experience o f the effects o f o u r animus on others, that we
 b ecom e convinced o f the reality o f this figure, a figure who previ-
 ously was but theoretically acknowledged. W hen opinions which
 we have always taken for gospel sep arate us from som eone who
 is vital to our feeling life, we may, for the first tim e, be willing to
 question their validity. H ere it is a m a tter o f h eart and integrity,
 for logic and argum ent have no effect whatsoever. W e can find a
 good deal about this aspect in Ju n g s essay on “T h e Psychology o f
 the Transference” and also in A ion, his new work on the symbol-
 ism o f the Self, which has just b een published in G erm an .23
    It is also in ou r vital relationships to m en that we usually first
 discover the animus in projection. As long as. the projectionufits,
 we are generally totally unaware that it exists. B u t sooner ordater,
 if the relationship is im portant enough, it is certain to give rise to
 trouble. This aspect o f ou r problem is described in an unsurpass-
 able way by E m m a Jung in h er excellent article, “A Contribution
 to the Problem of the Anim us.”24

    Although th ere are exceptions, m ost w om en who have exp e­

ingly negative tow ard him. H e is apparently forever thwarting
o u r intentions, spoiling our relationships, replacing o u r sound
instincts and feelings with a m ere collection o f opinions, and
altogeth er preventing us from living ou r lives naturally as w om en.
This is only too tru e o f the animus in his negative asp ect. And
w hen we only exp erien ce this side, w e are obliged sooner or
later to ask ourselves, W hy do I know so little of my own mind?
W hy axn I on such bad term s with my anim us? W h at am I doing
that he always thw arts m e? Obviously, early experiences with the
projected anim us— a negative father com plex, for instance— play
a g reat role h ere and m ust always be taken into acco u n t.25 But, as
Jung says ín Psychology a n d A lch em y :


       [N]o matter how much parents and grandparents may have                                  cp*-
       sinned against the child, the man who is really adult will
       accept these sins as his own condition which has to be reck-
       oned with. Only a fool is interested in other peoples guilt
       since he cannot alter it. The wise man leam s only from his
       own guilt.. H e will ask himself: Who am I that ali this should
       happen to me? To find the answer to this fateful question, he
       will look into his own heart.26


   If then w e d ecid e to grow up and b eco m e adult in th e sense
that Jung m eans h ere, and if we w ant to put the “fateful question”
to ourselves for which w e m ust look into our own depths, then
w e shall not be in a position to answ er until w e have faced the
A u sein a n d ersetzu n g with our own anim us.27

      As m entioned b efore, the animus is always dual. H e has a
 negative and a positive aspect. If w e constantly run up against the
 negative side, we m ay assume— as is usually also the case in our
 hum an relationships— that we are failing to see his point o f view.


 t                    NEGO TIATIONS W IT H T H E ANIMUS
 This brings us to a way o f com ing to term s with the animus which
 is recom m en d ed in the passage from “T h e Relationship B etw een
 the E g o and the U nconscious” m entioned above. In regards to
 the anim a, Jung says that a man would be singularly “right to treat
 the anim a as an autonom ous personality and to address personal
 questions to h er” and adds, “I m ean this as an actual technique. ”28
    T hese conversations with the anim a o r animus are a form of
 so-called active im agination, a technique which is unsurpassed
 in providing a middle territory w here conscious and unconscious
 can unite.29 (It is altogeth er beyond th e limits o f this p ap er to
 tou ch m ore than the fringe o f this subject although it is intimately
" con n ected with ou r th em e.) It is, however, not a technique for
  everybody and, m oreover, spould not be used lightly, for it has
 effects w hich one can n ot foresee. This actually applies to all forms
 o f meditation. It is well known, for instance, that the spiritual
 exercises o f St. Ignatius o f Loyola are so exhausting that certain
 people have to be sent away or are only given the exercises in a
 m itigated form .30 A nother aspect o f the same problem is evident

 Ignatiuss diplomacy and leadership qualities made him very useful to the Duke of Nájera
 and Viceroy of Naverra, under whom he served during numerous wars up until his thirtieth
 year of life. During several months of recovery following a severe injury, he began to study
 Christian works and then chose to lead a life of self-denying labor and to emulate the heroic
 deeds of Francis of Assisi along with other great monastic leaders. Upon recovery, he visited
 the Benedictine monastery of Monterrat, where he purportedly hung his milita1y vestments
 before an image of the Virgin Mary. He then spent several months in a cave in Cataloni,
 where he practiced the most rigorous asceticism. He begged his way on a journey to the Holy
 Land, as a way of self-denial and sacrifice. W hile in Paris, his spiritual preaching granted him
 some attention from the French Inquisition. The spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola

to th e inner world and w ere correspondingly w eakened in the

unconscious because h er life is disturbed by knowing too íittle
o f h er own mind o r anim us, is in a very different position from
th e B ron tes.)
   N everth eless, it can n o t be em phasized enough th at the
tech n iq u e o f active im agination should b e used with th e utm ost
seriousness or not at ali. M oreover, a relationship to a partner,
an analyst, o r to som eon e else who will u nderstand and provide
a hold on the o u te r w orld is indispensable. Perhaps fortunately,
w e have— o r alm ost ali o f us have— th e g reatest resistances to
using it. Very few p eop le to u ch it unless they are fo rced to do
so. M ost p eop le think th at th ey are inventing the whole thing
o r else th ey are afraid o f it from th e beginning. Som e people
in d eed seem to use it with a sort o f fatal facility, they can pro-
d u ce fantasies by the dozen w ithout it having any d irect effect
on them at ali as far. as on e can see. This m ay o ccu r w hen people
do not give them selves actively to it and th erefo re it rem ains
ineffective both in a positive and negative sen se. Exam ples of
a passive and active attitu d e tow ard fantasy can b e found in
th e ch a p te r on ‘T h e T ech n iq u e o f D ifferentiation B etw een the

   T h e form o f active imagination that Jung m entions in this pas-
sage is th at o f holding conversations with a personifíed anim a or
animus. H e tells us h ere that the art consists in allowing o n es visà
vis a voice and placing the m eans and the m edium o f expression at
his o r h er disposal. This technique requires a lot o f practice. One
m ust learn, for instance, to put a question actively and then to be
com p letely passive until the answ er com es o f itself. After a bit,
are a month-long program of meditations, prayers, and contemplative practices based in part
in retreat and asceticism. Ed. ]

the answers are usually so far from w hat one could think o f con-
sciously that the question o f w hether or not one actually invents
th e reply oneself disappears. O ne m ust always try to find out who
is speaking and, when the conversation is over, weigh it very care-
fully as one does in a conversation with a hum an vis-à-vis. I have
jound that one can leam things o f the g reatest value about on e’s
animus, as well as o th er figures . . . if they appear. M oreover, this
m ethod is the best one I know for really com ing to term s with
the unconscious.33
   O ne day, when a w om an who did a good deal o f active imagi­
nation was talking to h er anim us, she h eard him suddenly rem ark:
“You and I are in a m ost awfully difficult position. W e are linked
together like Siamese twins and yet belong to totally different
realities. You know, your reality is just as invisible and ghostlike
to m e as mine is to you.” T h e com m en t took h er by surprise.
She had to adm it that she had never thought o f that before. She
had naively assum ed that he saw everything in our reality as we
do ourselves. In fact, som e o f his in terferen ce had given h er the
impression that he saw it a good deal too clearly ^ d that this was
the reason why he could so frequently outwit us.
   T he wom an then asked him , “B ut if our reality is so insubstan-
tial to you, why do you so often in terfere?" H e replied, “I f you
leave som ething undone, it makes a vacuum , and, w hether I want
it or not, I am forced to intervene. B u t I can quite understand that
in term s o f your world it m ay often be beside the m ark.” .
    Jung has often pointed out that when the animus interferes
in our daily life, it is usually in a place w here we have not given
the m atter our fullest conscious consideration and particularly
w here we fail in the realm o f feeling. B u t it seem s to m e that
the rem ark about the two realities is very enlightening. It shows
us, for instance, that the animus is just as m uch in n eed o f infor-
mation from us about our reality as we are from him about his

33. [Barbara Hannah writes: “By ‘this method’ I mean active imagination in general. The
visual form in which the woman watches her animus objectively and learns to take a hand in
the game herself is at least equally ,effective. Some women prefer to do things silently with
their animus, just feeling his presence, and so on. The important thing is to find the way
which suits the individual.” Ed.]

reality. M oreover, just as he can help us in the invisible w orld o f
the collective unconscious, so— evidently— w e can help him in
ou r reality. W e also see h ere the danger for the w om an with the
anim us called Archibald o f Consulting him about ali o f the details
o f h er daily life.
   W e find the sam e idea in an oth er form in a m ost interest-
ing series o f dream s and active im aginations which E m m a Jung
presents and interprets in the second part o f h er aforem entioned
article on the animus. T h e animus, w hich appeared in the first
dream as a bird-headed m onster with a bubblelike bodv, begins
to lose its dangerous and destructive ch a ra cter in a dream w here
he is living on the m oon as the ghostly lover o f a hum an girl. She
m ust take a blood sacrifice to him each new m oon, although in
betw een she m ay live freely on the earth as a hum an being. As the
new m oon approaches, the ghostly lover tu m s h e r into a beast o f
prey and, as the brute, she is forced to bring the sacrifice to her
lover. Through the sacrifice, however, the ghostly lover him self is
turned into a sacrificial bowl w hich, like the O uroboros, devours
and renew s itself and out o f the smoke o f the burning blood o f the
victim shoots forth a m any-colored flower.34
    In a later fantasy, this sam e animus, whose narne interestingly
enough is A m andus (literally, “to be loved”), entices th e girl to
en te r his house, gives h er wine, and takes h er into a cellar with
the purpose o f killing her. T h e girl is suddenly seized with a
kind o f ecstasy, throws h er arm s round the m u rd erer in a loving
em b race which robs him o f his whole pow er so that, after prom is-
ing to stand by h er in the future as a helpful spirit, he dissolves
into the air. E m m a Jung points out th at the ghostly pow er o f the
m oon bridegroom is broken by the blood sacrifice (that is, by the
gift o f libido) and the pow er o f the w ould-be m u rd erer by the
loving em b race.
    As we are aspiring to deal with the strictly practical side, we
should try to translate this into term s o f everyday life. W hat does
it m ean to give libido and love to th e anim us? In the first p art of
h er article, E m m a Jung has m ade this clear. It means to give him
34. Emma Jung, Animus and Anima, p. 33.
               The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



energy, tim e, and attention, not only in ord er to get acquainted
w ith him, b u t also that h e may have the opportunity to express
through us his spiritual and m ental nature. W h en we give him
libido and love, w e consciously and intentionally place our facul-
 ties at his disposal in o rd er that he m ay have the means o f express-
jn g the values o f his reality in our reality. (This, o f cou rse, includes
ali Creative work, which is difficult for m any w om en unless they
have som e special gift.)
   In the first exam ple, th e girl is tu m e d into a b east o f prey. This
is a p rocess that we can observe clearly both in life and in analysis,
for exam ple, when we spoil an h our with the analyst, for instance,
by getting into th e animus and letting him twist everything until
it is ali just beside the point and w e are offended, angry, and so
forth. W hen we go hom e, the animus goes on tem pting us: “T h e
analyst should not have said this o r th at”; “he does not understand
m e ”; “he has a p referen ce for so-and-so.”
     I f we give in to these ideas, it will not b e long before we are
fired up and com pletely identícal with ou r em otions, that is, with
our passionate shadow who, in tu m , identifíes with our animal
nature. T h e animus opinions have tu m ed us into a beast o f prey.
But if we admit and know that we let the animus catch us (in this
case, facing the fact that w e have lost the hour and m ade a nui-
sance o f ourselves, if not w orse), we suffer the penalty and thus,
by our sujferin g, give the blood that can transform the animus.
    If anything at ali is to be gained, then it is essential to real­
ize that it was the animus and his opinions that spoiled the hour
against the wish o f the conscious ego. T h e animus. it is true, will
always turn the tables very neatlv. and if h e fails in his endeavor to
make a woman blam e tlie analyst, husband, partner, o r w hoever it
b e, then he will attem pt to throw the ivhole balance on the woman
herself. If she believes him , she will get into a state o f inferiority,
which is just as destructive as h er em otion and rage. This blaming
a woman for ali that he does him self is one o f his best trum p cards,
for he thus blinds h er to his own existence and the thing for which
she can really be blam ed: fa ilu re to know h e r own animus. In his
untransform ed state we may always reckon with the fact that he is

trying to get us back into the “unconscious fold o f m oth er nature”
and to prevent any escap e from the old order. And w e also are
veiy reluctant to leave the false security that pervades such an
unconscious state o f possession. W e talk a lot o f love o f freedom ,
it is tru e, but this love is inclined to be rath er superficial and
lukewarm. W e also love avoiding responsibility, particularly inner
rcsponsibilíty. It is píeasant to be convinced that we know what
to do— and no one is m ore convincing on this point than the ani­
m us— and if once we give up accepting his guidance unquestion-
ably, we shall find ourselves in constant doubt. D oubt is indeed
very lam ing to the young, but as Jung on ce rem arked in a seminar,
later in life doubt is th e beginning o f w isdom .35 H e w rites:


       Doubt is the crown o f life and ali certainty is merely one-
       sided. For in uncertainty and doubt, truth and error come
       together. Doubt is life, truth is often stagnation and death.
       When you are in doubt you have the greatest opportunity to
       unite the dark and the light sides o f life.36
   )
    E x tre m e certainty in th e anim us is always a sign that only one
side o f him is constellated, for his real dual nature form s a m ost
painful paradox. E n d u rin g this paradox is one o f the ch ief ways we
can give the “blood” n eed ed to transform the animus.
    A situation such as m entioned above, w hen the animus has
tw isted what has b een said until it is ali ju st beside th e mark, is
often an excellent opportunity to begin a conversation with him.
W e m ust keep an extrem ely open mind, however, for his logos
principie is the direct opposite to relationship, and his interfer-
en ce, though quite w rong from our point o f view, may be logical
and even right from his. T h ese conversations, th erefore, are quite
as difficult as any conversation in the ou ter world and dem and a
total effo rt, for w e m ust see his point o f view while we stand firm
in ou r own.

In ord er to get a real idea o f th e p ractical side of the animus, we
m ust see him at work in a hum an life. F o r this purpose, I have
^aken the m aterial from a very im pressive d ocu m en t belonging
to the second half of the sixteenth centuiy. It co n cem s the case
o f a nun nam ed Jean n e F e ry who was possessed at a very early
age and freed o f h er possession in h e r tw enties by m eans o f an
extended period o f exorcism s. P art o f this docum ent is auto-
biographical; the wom an h erself describes h er experiences while
she was possessed. T h e rem ainder is an accou n t o f the end o f
th e case, including the long and w eary process o f the exorcism
itself. T h e docum ent is signed by a lawyer in th e p resen ce o f the
Archbishop o f C am brai as well by various confessors, doctors, and
oth er eyewitnesses including m any o f the sisters in the convent
w here Jeanne was a nun.
    Perhaps the read er will be surprised to find such outlandish
m aterial in a pap er which claims to be dealing with our own daily
con tact with the anim us.37 B u t the people in the Middle Ages still
had a naive attitude tow ard these p h en om ena and w ere thus able
to describe their experiences m uch m ore graphically and simply
than our own rational prejudices would ever allow. This is cer-
tainly extrem e m aterial, and it is an extrem e case. M oreover, it is
37. [Dramatic and bizarre symptoms similar to that o f Jeanne Fery are to found in contem-
porary psychiatric case material in the areas o f severe and violent abuse issues. Now, in the
twenty-first centuiy, the cause of such symptoms is readily suspected to lie in the realm of
repetitive and/or prolonged abuse issues. At the time of Barbara Hannahs drafting of this
text, less than fífty psychiatric disorders were recognized. Some forty to fifty years later,
that is, as of the twentieth-first century, nearly four hundred disorders have been identified
by the World Health Organization in theif International Classification o f Diseases and by
the American Psychiatric Association in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual o f Mental
Disorders. The psychiatric dissociative identity disorders, or the more popularly known mul-
tiple personality disorder, first attained general professional acknowledgment towaTd tlie
end of the previous century and were less known in psychiatric circles prior to this time.
Thus, the association of such symptoms with possible physical or sexual abuse first became
popularly acknowledged in psychological literature several decades after the formulation of
this text. Nevertheless, this development has no detrimenta] affect on the content of Barbara
Hannah's essays orv Jeavme Feiy. In volume 2 of this work, comprehensive essays and an
analysis of the material from Jeanne Fery are presented; see the discussion of dissociative
identity disorders in footnote 41 and in volume 2 of this work. Ed.]

 w hen she was four years old in th e shape o f a handsom e young
 m an who offered to b ecom e h e r father.41 As he gave h er white
 bread and apples, she accep ted his suggcstion and cam e to regard
 him as h er real father. W hile she was a child, th ere w ere two o f
ythese father figures, and the second always prevented h er from
 feeling the strokes when she was b eaten . This lasted until she was
 twelve years old, when, tired o f the convent w here she was being
 educated, she returned to h er m other. H e r m other, however, soon
 sent her away to Mons as an apprentice to a dressmaker. H ere she
 seem s to have b een left alm ost entirely to h er own devices. At this
 point, the first young man ap p eared to h er again and told h er that,
 as she had accep ted him as h er father, sh e.m ust now— being no
 longer a child— renounce h er baptism and ali th e cerem onies o f
 the Christian C hurch, ratify h er earlier agreem ent, and prom ise
 to live according to his will. H e told h er that eveiybody lived this
 way, although they did not say so. H e th reaten ed her with dire
 punishm ent if she refused and prom ised h er gold and silver and
 every delicious food she desired if she accep ted .42 After a short
 resistance, she agreed to everything, and im m ediately a.m ultitude
 of spirits appeared and forced h er to sign the co n tract with h er
 blood. (This was a shock to h er as she had never seen m ore than
 two o r at m ost th ree of these figures b efore.) The.y then enclosed
 the agreern.ent in a pom egranate and forced her to eat it. It was
 marvelously sw eet . . . up till th e last b ite whieh was m ore b itter
 than she could endure.
    F ro m that tim e on, she took a great disliking for th e C hurch.

H e r ou ter confessions w ere naturally entirely falsified, but, inter-
estingly enough, she apparently had to confess the exact truth
to one o f h er spírits particularly con cern in g any pious action or
prayer and was then forced to p erform severe pen an ce. She was
also obliged to take th e host out o f h er m outh at Mass and hide
it in h e r handkerchief, and then— although she tried to keep it
in a clean p lace— it was spirited away.43 H e r spirits taught h er
to despise every+bing to do with C hristianity and sco ff a t a God
who could not save him self from th e cross. She believed them
implicitly, thought C hrist w orse than th e thieves with w hom he
was cru cified , and could no longer understand how people could
rev ere such a God. T h ey persuaded h e r to think h erself the hap-
piest and m ost privileged o f m ortais.
   A fter she en tered th e çonvent, she had to sign a new co n tract
with th e spirits, pledge them both h e r soul and body forever, and
oath was rep eated again on the night that she took h e r final vows
as a nun. She also had to renounce th e pope and the “evil arch-
bishop” to whom she had m ade h er Christian vows. T h e spirit in
possession o f h er tongue m ade h er very bright and witty, and, in
o rd er not to lose this gift, she gave on e spirit h er m em oiy, another
h e r reason, and a third h e r will. As she says, they thus en tered and
took up their abode in her, each in his own p lace.44 T h ey also took
possession o f h er body, again appearing as a legion o f devils for
this purpose. T h e so-called “spirit o f blood”— som etim es called
the devil o r even th e god o f blood— played a great role in the cer-
em on ies. (As b eco m es clear in th e acco u n t o f the exorcism , a spe-

and e a ch had to be driven out separately by the archbishop.) T hey

she then might worship C h rist as well as h er oth er gods. This
m ade h er spirits very angiy. T h ey m ade h e r ta k e a p iece o f the

she thus p ierced the host, blood flowed forth and the whoje room
was filled with a bright radiancejw hich surrounded it. Then_she.
was very.frightened, for ali her. spirits. fled with. terrible shrieks,
and she was left alone exhausted on the floor.
   She now realized for the first tim e that she had b een deceived
and, w hen she thought o f the visionary sign that had been granted
her, she fell into despaír. T h e spirits then returned and, changing
their tune, rep roach ed h er for h e r treatm en t o f th e tru e God—
who they now said was also their G od— and told h er that h er sins
would never be forgiven, so she had b etter follow the exam ple
o f Judas Iscariot and hang h erself with her leath er girdle. She
gave it into their hands and told th em to hang h er if they pleased.
But, although they tried to kill h e r in every way they could, their
attem pts w ere always thw arted. She also failed— despite a crowd
o f spirits who w ere helping her— at several actual attem pts to
kill herself.
    T hen a tim e of great suffering began for Jeanne. H er spirits
prevented her from confessing to a priest. F o r the first tim e, the
authorities began to notice that she was not what she should be
as a Christian and a nun. The m atter was taken up by Louis de
Berlaym ont who was Archbishop and D uke o f C am bria at that
time. H e took a most active part in h er liberation, but although it
was h er transference to him that eventually freed her, the spirits ini-
tially blinded h er to him. Although she had at once felt an impulse
to take refuge with him, he seem ed to h er to be severe and terrible.
She says that although the spirits torm ented h er with the most hor-
rihle visions o f hell and so forth, M ary M agdalene appeared as her
protector and never gave w ay Jeanne assures us that ali this really
happened and was neither simply fantasy nor imagination.

   T liere are still a few facts which w e m ust take from th e o th er
part o f the d ocum ent. W e le a m th e re that, although she was
exorcised at o n ce, h e r liberation actually required two years. It
entailed the m ost rigorous efforts on th e p art o f th e exorcists,
particularly o f the archbishop himself, and o f several o f th e sisters
who assisted them in their work. In cred ib le efforts w ere actually
dem anded from th e archbishop. A t on e point, he was fo rced by
M ary M agdalene to take the nun into his house w here she stayed
for a y e a r in th e face o f the m ost spiteful gossip from th e w hole
diocese. Jean n e s own attitude varied. A vision o f M ary M agdalene,
who, interestingly enough, first ap p eared w hen she threw h erself
at Üie feet o f th e archbishop.. would stren gth en h er wish to be
freed. T h e spirits, however, still had a g re a t deal o f p ow er over
her, and m ost o f the tim e she showed the greatest obstinacy and
resistance. H e r spirits pounded h e r with th eir advice to com m it
suicide or, accord in g to Jean n e F ery , threw h er violently about
the room and even out o f the window. She was always black and
blue, and h er health suffered so severely th at one tim e h e r d o cto r
and several oth ers w ere highly co n ce rn e d that she m ay actually
not recover. At o th e r tim es, h er senses d eserted h er and she was
practically out o f h e r mind. She was taken around to ali th e sacred
relics within reach , bathed in holy w ater, and constantly exor-
cized. Slowly, th e evil spirits had enough o f such treatm en t and
dep arted — ali excep t one: the original fath er figure. H e told h er
that he had no intention o f deserting her. H e had done everything
for h er— m ade h e r witty, intelligent, and so on— and th at if he
left her, she w ould regress to a m ere child o f four, that is, th e age
w hen she was first possessed. She Was also m ost unwilling to be
parted from him and fell at the feet o f h e r exorcists, begging th em
to leave h e r just this one tim e. W hen this req uest was refused, she
cried: “O w hat a bitter separation” and was in com plete despair.
She only co n sen ted w hen h e r main exorcist prom ised h e r that he
would be h e r fath er and the archbishop h e r grandfather.
   W h en th e last spirit had left her, she lay exhausted, a natural
simple child w ho could only say: “father,” “hou se,” and “p retty
M ary.” It req u ired rep eated blessings from the archbishop to free

 tim es, always with a strengthening effect. N evertheless, Jeanne
f had constant relapses, and on ce the archbishop was so violently
  attacked by the spirits that we are told he was only just able to
 defend him self and escap e with his life.45
    T h e final scen e (with which I would like conclu de this report)
 is particularly interesting from ou r point o f view. Jeanne asked
 ali the priests and sisters who had been helping her to gather
 around, and th en , in the p resen ce o f h er protecting saint M ary
 M agdalene, she began h er final co m b at with her spirits. She held
 a long conversation with them herself. (This is the only case I have
 m et so far w here the sufferer does the talldng herself. Such con-
 versations are com m on in the books, bu t it is usually the exorcist
 who talks to the spirits.) D uring this conversation— w hich, unfor-
 tunately, is n ot rep orted in detail— she cried out in anguish sev-
 eral tim es, saying that the spjrits w ere torturing h er unbearably.
 She also begged for th e help o f ali those present. T hey prayed
 for h er unceasingly and at last, although com pletely exhausted,
 she purportedly em erged from th e fight healed and victorious.
 Shortly afterw ard, M ary M agdalene appeared to her o n ce again
 and assured h e r that th ere would be no return. Jean ne was finally
 able to return to a norm al life w ith the oth er nuns o f her convent
 with the condition that the archbishop him self (although freed
 from ali o u ter obligations) had to rem ain h er confessor and spiri-
 tual guide for the rest o f his life.
    As a good m any o f th e details rep orted border on w hat could
 seem to be the so-called supernatural, I would like to quote a

 45. [No matter how one chooses to interpret these credibly documented events, the vivid-
 ness of these psychie figures—even if theír source is strictly limited to the psyche of Fery
 herself—serves as a witness to the sheer force and the reality of psychie personifications
 independent of any personal or historical setting. That such psychic constellations dramati-
 cally affect others in the immediate environment can be witnessed today, for instanee, in
 observing how symptoms of personality disorders, dissociative identity disorders, or acute
 psychosis of one family member contaminate and distort the perceptions, convictions, and
 behavior of aíl other members of the family. E d.)

short passage from Psychology a n d R eligion. Ju n g gives here a
succinct statem en t as to the standpoint o f his psychology toward
such m aterial. This standpoint, he w rites:

      is exclusívely phenomenological, that is, it is concemed with
      occurrences, events, experiments— in a word, with facts. Its
      truth is a fact and not a judgment. When psychology speaks,
      for instance, of the motif of the virgin birth, it is only con­
      cem ed with the fact that there is such an idea, but it is not
      concemed with the question whether such an idea is true
      or false in any other sense. The idea is psychologically true
      inasmuch as it exists. Psychological existence is subjective
      in so far as an idea occurs in only one individual. But it is
      objective in so far as that idea is shared by a society— by a
      consensus gentium.46


    T h ere is no doubt from the n u m b er o f witnesses, in whose
p resen ce th e d ocu m en t was signed, th at this report was estab-
lished by a consensus gentium . M oreover, this is only one o f
hundreds, o r even thousands, o f such reports. T h erefore, w e are
co n cern ed with th e fact that a consensus gen tiu m was convinced
o f th e reality o f these phenom ena and not with the question of
w h eth er the supernatural elem ents in th e case actually happened
or not.
   It seem s to m e that Jean n es exp erien ce with h er spirits gives
us an unusually clear p ictu re o f hovv the anim us can possess a
w om an and wrap h er away from the world in a sort o f cocoon
o f fantasies and opinions. B ut, as he represents h er unconscious
m ind, he can sim ultaneously m ake h er very intelligent, and even
witty, so that she can im press h er environm ent even though she
can n ot relate to it. No one n oticed that th ere was anything wrong
with Jean n e until the sign from th e host threw h er into a violent
conflict. It was then, at that m om ent, that som ething was first
noticed. It is very difficult for us to realize the extent to which

 mankind is possessed and that a girl like Jeanne m ight easily
 escape detection b ecause she would not seem so very different
 than many other young gírls or w om en.
      O f course, w hen possession has an effect on the environ-
  m en t which passes a certain d egree— as was the case with Hitler,
/ for instance— it is evident to everyone who stands outside the
  ch arm ed circle. As Jung writes in his essay, “W otan,” in 1936:


        The impressive tliing about the German phenomenon is that
        one man, who is obviously “possessed,” has infected a whole
        nation to such an extent that eveiything is set in motion and
        has started rolling on its course towards perdition."17


 T h ese words w ere w ritten in 1 9 3 6 and w ere am ply b o ra e out
 by subsequent events. B u t the faet th at such a thing was pos-
 sible “in a civilized co u n tiy th at has long been supposed to have
 outgrow n th e M iddle A ges” is a sym ptom o f our m odern state
 o f mind which we can n ot afford to overlook.48To put th e blam e

 a p ro ced u re w e en co u rage the w hole problem to reinain in its

 in ourselves.49
    M any w om en would be able to find certain parallels to
 Jeanne s childhood exp erien ce with h e r spirits if they looked
 back thoughtfully on th eir own childhood. Som e children still
 escape— when the ou ter world seem s cold, unsym pathetic, or
 unbearable— to an im aginary w orld peopled with figures not
 fully dissimilar to Je a n n e s spirits. This often seem s harm less
 enough and may even b ear w onderful fruit later in life if this

and attracts a negative anim us sim ilar to Je a n n e s spirits, ou t-

sort o f altitu d e are ali m anifestations o f th e negative asp ect o f
our unconscious m ind which is lying in w ait for us today ju st as
it was in th e tim e o f Jean n e F ery . In a discussion at the E ran o s
C o n feren ces in A scona, Jung o n ce p oín ted out th at th e anim us,
in and o f itself, is n eith er good n or evil, b u t is a com pletely dual
figure.50 H e only b eco m es infernal w hen he hooks onto egotistical
dem ands in th e hum an being.
   Jean n e, it is tru e , evidently had unusuaíly few roots in the
outside world. H e r negative fath er com p lex does not seem to
have been co m p en sated by the m other, for ali we h ear about the
latter is th at she soon sent h er away to a considerable distance.
M oreover, she evidently took no trou b le to see that the girl was
looked after, for Jean n e tells us she was left alm ost com pletely
free while she lived with the dressm aker.
   H e r childish lapses would not have bound h er quite in the

percent certainty whether the spirit-figures in dreams are morally good. Very often they
show ali the signs of duplicity, i f not outright malice.” He then mentions more positive ani­
mus figures such as the wise old man, the doetor, the magician, the priest, the teacher, grand-
father, helpful dwarves or animais, and so forth. H e also notes their role in the enantiodromia
between good and evil. See C. G. Jung, “The Phenomenology of the Spirit in Faiiy Tales”

Jean n e evidently knew already h ere th at she was doing wrong,
for we hear that she resisted for a tim e. It is interesting th at this
resistance was directly followed by the appearan ce o f a “legion”
o f spirits. In oth er words, she had ratificd h er agreem en t and thus
 set the seal to a continuance o f the infernal aspect o f h er animus.
t    To a lesser d egree, we can observe the sam e process in
ourselves each tim e we give way to an animus opinion, for it is

and see what we have d one, a whole chain o f resistances, opin­

in no tim e we shall be identical with o u r animal shadow, th at is,
com pletely unconscious and possessed by the animus m uch as
Jeanne herself.
   Now, in ord er to keep h er witty tongue, she was obliged to
give h er memory, reason, and will to th ree separate spirits. E v e iy
read er who has had practical exp erien ce in the field o f analysis
will, at ali events, recognize this m echanism . In som e cases, it
really seem s as if what was said was twisted befo re it reaches
the patients consciousness. This m echanism is particularly clear
as regards memory. One often has th e feeling that som e little
dem on is constantly at w ork taking away the im portant things
and replacing them with inappropriate, clever, yet meaningless
opinions. T he language o f those days seem s to m e particularly apt
in this respect.
    Interestingly enough, the downfall o f Jean n e’s spirits and the
first step toward h er recovery o ccu rs when she thinks that she
might have Christ as well as h er oth er gods and then asks for a
sign. T he sign, however, because it com es from th e opposite pole,
throws h er into an unbearable conflict, into ali she had been try-

w e see Iiow brilliantly the animus can tu m the tables w hen it
suits him to do so and how he can red u ce a w om an to a hopeless
state o f inferiority. Such devious duplicity w hich puts the blam e
011 th e w om an no m a tte r what happens— particularly for w hat
he has done him self— is really th e hallm ark o f the animus in his
negatíve asp ect.
   It seem s to m e th at the m ost enlightening and certainly the
m ost reassu rin g thing.about th e whole case is th e intervention o f
M ary M agdalene, th e great sinner and th e g re at loyer. Je a n n e has
to re a c h co m p lete despair, see h erself as Judas Iscariot, and try
to d raw th e logical co n seq u en ce b efo re this figure is constellated.
In o th e r w ords, she m ust go to th e brink o f desperation. In psy-
chologica] language, M ary M agdalene w ould b e a configuration o f
the Self. It is tru e that th ere is no shadow figure in the m aterial;
Jean n e is, so to speak, living on th e shadow levei h erself so that it
w ould b e, in any case, h e r b e tte r qualities w hich w ere repressed.
M oreover, in th e earlier stages o f analysis, for instance, the figures
o f th e shadow and S elf often ap p ear as one.
   T h e re are tw o im portant detaiüfs om itted by G õrres. F irst, it
was a t th e m o m en t w hen Jean n e threw h erself at th e feet o f th e
archbishop that M ary M agdalene first ap p eared in a vision, a
gestu re th at recalls M ary M agdalene h erself w ashing the feet o f
C h rist with h e r tears and anointing th em with the precious oint-
m en t (L u k e 7 :3 8 ). This shows us that it was Jean n e s tran sferen ce
to th e archbishop that first released positive and healing forces
in h e r own psyche. G õrres also om itted to note that th e autobio-
graphical accou n t, which was said to have b een d ictated by M ary
M agdalene, was w ritten in one sitting, an exam ple o f w hat m ay
have b een au tom atic writing.
    M ary M agdalene fits the role o f th e re d e e m e r to p erfection .
F irst, she rep resen ts the one who— as a prostitute— sinned and
rep en te d or, in psychological language, a cce p te d the responsibil-
ity for h e r dark side. T h erefore h e r intervention points to the fact
that Jean n e m ay n ot seek the easy way out. She m ust see w hat she
has done and take the consequences. S econ d , M ary M agdalene,
as the g re a t lover, represents w om ans best defense against being

    possessed by the animus. H ere, a w om an takes the heart as her
    guiding principie and listens to h e r tru e feelings instead o f having
    opinions about how she ought to feel. (Naturally, psychological
    types play a certain role h ere, b ut we have no tim e to en ter into
    this aspect.)
f      W ith the intervention o f M aiy M agdalene, Jean n e can no
    longer function with such duplicity betw een the Catholic and
    dem on-possessed worlds. T h e approach o f any im age o f the Self
    always tears away the veils o f hypocrisy and illusion and confronts
    us with what we really are. As a C ath olic nun living nearly four
    hundred years ago, Jean n e was naturally in a very different posi­
    tion to what we would b e today. T h e solution of exorcism , which

    naturally strikes us today as unsatisfactoiy. But at that tim e, it was
    presum ably the only solution, and even today th ere are a few cases
    w here people seem to be possessed by “alien spirits” from the col­
    lective unconscious, that is, by som ething to which it is impossible
    for them to make any kind o f relationship. I have heard Jung say
    in m ore than one case that the only thing to b e done was to help
    the patient lock away a certain asp ect o f the animus.
         T h e practice o f exorcism is by no m eans so m uch on the shelf
    in C h u rch circles as one is inclined to assume. T he work o f the
    Capuchin monks in this direction, for instance, is well known and
    m uch resp ected , in Switzerland at any rate. I adm it, however, that
    I was agreeably surprised to leam from his biography that the late
    N ugent Hicks, Bishop o f Lincoln and form erly Vicar o f Brighton,
    had p racticed exorcism him self on m ore than one occasion. H e
    undoubtedly took the existence o f possessing dem ons seriously
    and sought the advice o f experts co n cem in g the problem o f what
    to do with the spirits after he had cast them ou t.52 This problem -
    atical issue appears again and again in the medieval literature on
    the subject.

    the leading role in h er recovery. It is interesting that the positive

asp ect o f th e anim us only ap p eared in p rojection. T h e re is no

that h e could hardly defend him self (which was always a m uch-

   T h e fact th a t Teanne h erself took such an active role in the
final scene o f h er liberation agrees with m odern experience.
Nothing can b e done if the will to b e cu red is lacking, if the
patient h erself will not take an active role. M oreover, th e fact that
Jean n e was now on such term s with the people around h er as to
be able to ask them for their collaboration shows how far she had
m oved from th e witty, intelligent but isolated girl who, according
to h e r own account, àpparently wished so m uch to im press h er
surroundings. She is now sufficiently related to h er environm ent
to expose h erself in h er weakness and has gained sufficient humil-
ity to know that th e people who she w ished to outshine are really
in a position to help herv
   T h e appearan ce o f M ary M agdalene “herself,” who tells
Jean n e that she is fmally liberated, agrees with our own experi­
en ce , accord in g to which it is only with the help o f the Self that
we can be freed from the animus in his possessive aspect. T h e
Self, as is well known, represents a unique individual experi­
en ce, but at the sam e tim e, it also has a collective aspect in that
ít reach es far beyond the com prehension o r experience o f any
individual.53 Although the anim us can rep resen t the p rin cip ie o f
individuation, he characteristically has a purely collective stand-
point. Jung has often pointed out that the animus thinks in term s
o f 1 1 ,0 0 0 virgins, that is, statistics and n u m b ers.54 W e can see

54. Jung wrote in 1940: "Optimists invariably hope that humanity learns by íts mistakes, and
that things will be better after a particularly foolish enor. But history teaches us the opposite.

this in our m aterial when he tells Jean n e— on the occasion o f h er
signing h er first con tract with him—-that “ev ery o n e lives that way,
although they, o f cou rse, do not say so.”
   Like ali m aterial from the past, the story o f Jean n e has mainly a
com parative value. It shows us how that era regarded certain psy-
ch ic phenom ena and observable psychic facts, facts w hich appear
ev er and again down through th e generations in new clothes.
Perhaps the m ost striking difference is the attitude tow ard the
opposites. A Jungian psychologist would presum ably have seen a
value in that last spirit, realized his dual nature, and known how
to help the girl transform him into a function betw een conscious
and unconscious w here, as Jung often says, the animus and anima
are in their right p lace.55 B ut in those days, the relativity o f good
and evil was still entirely unrecognized.

the hum an being, along w ith the possibilities o f how to cop e with
th em , w e should attem p t to strip off an oth er layer, as it w ere, and
try to see som ething o f the dual nature o f these forces that form
the collective archetypal background o f each individual psyche.
Jung has often pointed out how well we can see this background
in the innum erable myths and fairy tales which are to be found ali
over the world. And in this treasu re trove w e can find th e back­
ground o f m yriad aspects o f our problem portrayed ever again in
innum erable guises.
   W e will take just one relatively simple fairy tale from the
G rim m brothers to illustrate this point, titled “T he Goose G irl.”
M arie-Louise von F ran z was kind enough to dravv my attention to
this stoiy. It suits our purpose particularly well, for h ere the role of
the shadow— which was missing in the m aterial of Jeanne F e ry —
is clearly p ortrayed .56 T h e fairy tale goes som ething like this:


       Once upon a time, there was an old queen who had a
       beautiful daughter: She had long been widowed by h er late
       husband. 'When the princess grew up, she was betrothed to
       a prince who lived a great distance away. Now this queen
       loved h er child with ali h er heart. So when the princesss
       wedding day approached and h er jou m ey to that distant
       kingdom lay near, the elderly queen packed her most pre~
       cious vessels o f silver and gold, her most costly trinkets and
      jewels, and gave everything she had to the royal dowry o f her
       beloved daughter.
            The queen arranged to send along a handmaiden to
       accompany the princess on the jo u m ey and present her to
       the bridgegroom. Each was given a horse fo r the joum ey,
       but Falada, the horse o f the kings daughter, was most excep-
       tional. . . fo r he could talk.57 When the hour o f parting had

me practically ali that I know conceming this issue.
57. Barbara Hannah notes: the origin and meaning of the name Falada are unknown, but
according to J. Bolzte and G. Palooka, the different versions of this horses name indicate
that it was a stallion and not a mare. J. Bolzte and G. Polkoka, Anuierkungen zu cíen Kinder

          come, the elderly Çueen Mother went into her hedroom, took
          a small knife, and cut h er fin g er until it bled. Into a white
           handkerchief fell three drops o f blood, and it was this hand-
           kerchief that she gave to h er daughter saying: “Dear child,
           preserve this carefully, fo r it will be o f Service to you on your
f          way.”
              So the princess put the white handkerchief to her bosom,
           mounted her horse, and, in sorrow, took her leave. After she
           had ridden half a day, she was overcome by a parching thirst
           and said to h er maid: “Dismount please and take the golden
           cup which you have brought fo r me. Do fetch some water
          from the stream, fo r I should like to drink. ”
               “I f you are thirsty,” snapped her maid, “then get o ff your
           horse and drink out o f the stream yourself. I am your maid,
           not your servant. ” So, in h er thirst, the princess alightedfrom
           Falada, bent down over the water in the stream, put her lips
           to the water, and drank, fo r she was not given the golden cup.
          Then she tum ed toward the sky above and said, “Ah, heaven,”
          and the three drops o f blood answered, “I f this your mother
          knew, her heart would hreak in two. ” But the kings daughter
           was humble, said nothing, and mounted her horse again.
               They rode many miles further, but the day was long, the
          sun scorching, and h er thirst great. So when they came again
           to a inountain stream, she asked her maid to dismount and
          fetch h er water in her golden cup, fo r she had long ago for-
           given and forgotten the girls ill intent. But the maiden said
          even more haughtily that if she wished to drink, she could
          get it herself. Then, in her dire thirst, the kings daughter
          dismounted, bent over the flowing stream, put her lips to the
          water, and drank. And wept, turning again to the sky above
          and m urmured, “Ah, heaven.” And the drops o f blood again
          replied, “I f this your mother knew, her heart would break
          in two. ”
              As she was leaning over the stream to drink, her eyes
          closed in sorrow, só great were h er worries, and the hand-

kerchief fell out o f her bosom and floated away without h er
noticing it. The maid, however, saw it and rejoiced, f o r she
knew that she now had pow er over the bride. With the loss o f
the handkerchief and the three drops o f blood, she knew that
the princess had become weak and powerless.
    So when the princess retum ed to mount h er horse, the
maid announced that Falada was more suitable f o r h e r and
told the princess that she would do just fin e on the old nag.
Then the maid dem anded that the princess exchange h e r
royal apparel f o r h er own humble garments and compelled
h er to take an oath by the heavens above that she would say
not one w ord o f this to anyone at the royal court. For an oath
to heaven broken would be dealt with swiftest death. Falada
observed ali o f this and remained silent.
    Having donned the royal attíre, the maid now mounted
Falada while the true bride mounted the nag in domestic
clothes. Onward they traveled over mountain and dale until
they arrived at the royal palace.
   Grçat rejoicings greeted them as they passed through the
palace gates, and the youthful prince leapt forth, coming to
the Service o f his bride-to-be. She was a bit more plumb than
he had been told, a good bit older than he had imagined,
but honorable as he toas, jud ged he not h er lack o f beauty,
flinched he not an eye, but lifted h er fro m her stallion and
escorted h e r up the broad stone stairway into the palace. The
poor princess stood dumbfounded and mute, watching this
ali fro m below.
    The prince^ father, a proud yet elderly king, happened
to be looking out o f lhe window and there, standing forlorn
in the courtyard below, was a delicate and most beautiful
handmaiden. He immediately went into to the royal apart-
rnent and asked the bride-to-be about the girl who had
accompanied h er and who was now standing down below.
“Oh, I picked h er up on my way fo r a companton," was the
answer. “Just give the girl something to work at so she may
not stand idle. ”
         The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



    But the old king had no work fo r h er and knew o f noth-
ing else better than to have the ■princess help a little boy tend
the geese. Conrad was his name, and thus the true princess
had to help a barefoot country boy take care o f the squab-
blingflock.
    Soon afterward, the false bride said to the young king,
“My dearest husband, I beg you to do m ejust one smallfavor.
I ask you so little. ”
    He answered, "I will certainly do so, and most willingly. ”
    “Then sen dfor the butcher and have the head o f the horse
on which I rode cut ojf, fo r it vexed me maliciously on the
way. ” She was, o f course, afraid that the horse might betray
how she had mistreated the queen’s daughter.
    She continued thereafter to badger the prince until he
promised, much against his will, that it would be done. Soon
the faithful Falada was to die. This came to the ears o f the
real princess who was deeply and hopelessly distraught. She
knew there was nothing to be done, fo r she feared not only his
certain death but, if she were to say anything at ali, h er own.
So she secretly promised the butcher her most valuable coin
o f pure gold ifh e would perform a small service f o r her. There
was a large, darkened gateway in the shadows o f the town
through which she passed each m om ing and evening, to and
fro, with the geese. Would he be so good as to nail Faladas
head above the archway so that she might see him coming
and going every day. The butcher promised to do that. And
thus he cut off the head, nailed itfast above that arch cast in
shadow, and pocketed the gold coin.
   Early each moming, when she and Conrad drove their
flock beneath this arch, she said: “Alas, my Falada, it causes
 me such sorrow to see you hanging there.” And the head
 would answer, “Alas, Young Queen, how ill you fare. I f this
your mother knew, h er heart would break in two. ”
    Then Conrad and the princess left the town and drove
their geese into the country side. When they had finally come
to the meadow, she mounted a little hillock and sat down
           The Problem o f Contact with the Animus                  45-



in the grasses to fr e e the lovely tresses o f h e r hair which
toppled down like pure gold. Conrad, already infatuated in
his assistant, delighted ali the more in the shining brightness
o f her unraveling curls and could not resistfrom plucking a
hair or two, But the princess wasfaster than this goose-herd
and said, “Blow thou gentle wind I say, blow Conrad’s little
hat away, and make him chase it here and there, untü Vve
braided ali my h a ir. . . and bound it up again. ”
   And there came a gust o f wind which tossed Conrads
hat ever fu rth er away, and it was his fa ther’s and even his
grandfathers old shepherd’s cap with a lovely white feather,
so o ffh e scurried to fetch it. When he finatty came back, she
had long finished combing h er hair and had pinned it up
again. And he could get nothing o f it. So Conrad fell into
an irritated mood and refused to speak to her. And thus
they watched the geese until they rose to return home in the
evening. The next day, when they were driving the geese out
through the dark gateway, the maiden said, “Alas, Falada,
hanging there. ” Falada answered, “Alas, Young Quqen, how
ill you fare. I f this your mother knew, her heart would break
in two. ”
    And so the days and weeks passed. Out through the gates
in the m oming, a word with Falada, then into the pastures
and up on the hillock where she would begin to comb out
h er hair. Conrad would try to clutch a handful, the princess
would call the wind, and away his hat would fly. When he
came back, her hair was tucked. up beneath h er bonnet and
he could get not a single strand. Then the day would be
spent in irritated silence and back through the arch they
passed again in the evening. Day after day, Conrad was
thwarted in his attempts to get a single strand o f h er glisten-
ing golden hair.
    So one evening after they had come home, Conrad
begged fo r a short audience with the aging king. In frustra-
tion, he expressed his wish to the king to be assigned another
assistant fo r pasturing the geese. The king inquired about the
         The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Wo^men



reason fo r his request, and Conrad answered, “Because she
vexes me the whole day long.” The king was upset that this
dainty girl could be so unruly, and wanting to protect the
young lad who was always so dutiful with the royal geese,
he commanded him to relate what it was that she did to him.
So Conrad said, “ln the m om ing, when we pass beneath the
dark gateway out o f the town, there is a horse’s head on the
watt, and I have heard her say to this head, 'Alas, Falada,
hanging there.’ And the head replies, ‘Alas, Young Queen,
how ill you fare. I f this your mother knew, h er heart would
break in two." Conrad went on to relate the other details o f
what happened out in the fields with the geese and how she
commanded a wind to come, and it c a u p so fast that he
always had to chase his hat o r it would be gane forever.
    The elderly king, wizened in years, info^ned the boy that
he himself would take the matter in hand and requested the
boy to drive his flock out again as usual the next moming. As
soon as dawn alit across the fields, the king placed hi-mself
behind the curtains o f an opened window looking out over
the dark archway, and he hi-mself then heard the maiden’s
conversation with the head o f Falada. Disguised as a old
hunchbacked shepherd, he hurried over a shorter route out
into the pastures, hid h i ^ e l f in a thicket on the hillock, and
watched as the goose girl and the goose herd approached with
their flock. When she sat on a small flat stone in the meadow,
she began to unravel h er hair. Then he heard her say, “Blow
thou gentle wind I say, blow Conrad’s little hat away, and
make him chase it here and there, until I ’ve braided all my
hair . . . and bound it up again.”
   Then c a ^ that merry gust o f wind and carried off
Conrad’s hat so very fa r away that he had to scurry like a
rabbit if he had any hopes at all o f seeing it again. So the
maiden unraveled h er m jestic tresses, which caught the
sunlight like fireflies at night, so marvelous was the sun in
her hair, and she quietly combed and. plaited her tresses and
rolled it up under her bonnet. All o f this the king observed.
           The Problem o f C ontact ivith the Anim us                47



Having seen enough o f such affairs in his lengthy years, and
well understanding that something dire was amiss, he quietly
slipped away.
    When the goose girl carne home in the evening, he called
h er into the royal hall and asked why she did ali these things.
The princess quickly tried to make up some story, but never
imagining that she would have to stand befòre a king, she
was entirely unprepared. It took a little seve-rity and deter-
mination with a bit o f that austere dignity o f a royal king to
get h e r to loosen up h er tonguejust enough to say, “I dare not
mention my sorrows to anyone at the court, f o r unto heaven
above have I sworn silence to ali members and servants o f the
royal family. I f l speak, 1 shall surely lose my life.”
   He left h er no peace, but true to h er vows, she refused to
say a word. Much to his surprise, the king could draw noth-
ing out o f her. Suspecting that such sovereignty in front o f
a king could only be com ingfrom royalty ítself, he said, "lf
you will not tell anything to the members o f the court, then
crawl into the cool silence o f the cast-iron stove that heats
the grand ballroom in uÁnter and speak your sorrows to
yourself. ” A nd he exited the chamber.
   In despair and sorrow, and with such a dire need to
speak freely h er sorrows even i f to a stove, she entered the
ballroom, closed the door, and crept into the large iron oven,
where she began to weep and lament, sobbingforth from the
depths o fh e r heart, saying, “H ere am I deserted by the whole
 world, and yet l am a kings daughter, and a false maid has
fo rced me to remove my royal attire, and she has taken my
 place with my bridegroom. But l o. . . I have sworn not to say
 a word u n der the heavens, and true will I be even i f l have to
 perform menial Service herding the geese until the daxj I die.
 Yet, if this my mother knew, her heart would break in two. ”
     The king, naturally, had positioned himself in an adjoin-
 ing room and set his ear against the stovepipe so that he
 could carefully catch her every word. When h er sobbing
 had subsided, he entered the royal cham ber again and bade
         The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



her come out o f the stove. Ladies-in-waiting were called to
take her at once to the royal baths, garments o f a queen were
brought f o r her, garlands offlowers set in h er hair, and soon
h er true beauty was ever more marvélous to behold . . . fo r
her suffering had made her a truly royal woman.
    The king summoned his son and revealed to him his true
bride standing now before him. The young prince rejoiced
with ali his heart when he saw h er beauty and her youth
and grace. It was as i f a millstone fell from his chest, no
doubt in relief and gratitude to have found his true bride. He
promptly announced the immediate preparations o f a great
feast to which good ministers and friends from ali the land
 were invited.
    Shortly thereafter, the prince sat at the head o f the table
with the true princess on his left and his “bride to be" on the
right. So haughty was this veritable maid, and so convinced
was she o f h er unblemished path to glory, that she failed to
take notice o f the golden-tressed woman sittingjust across
the table. Naturally, h er oversight— or mayfre it was simply
blurred Vision— was to an ample extent due to the assistance
o f a good quantity o f ale and the fact that herfocus anyway
converged not on the woman across the table but on the wild
boar sizzling on the spit over oak splits crackling in the royal
fireplace near the heaps o f potatoes, com , and pies on side
 tables. When ali had quenched their hunger and thirst to their
hearts content— and the niaid’s heart was large indeed— the
old king interrupted the ruckus and proclaimed atfull volume
that the time had now come f o r a ridcUe to be asked, a duty
that every king had to fulfill at the royal banquet in honor o f
his future daughter-in-law. The self-acclaimed future queen
ruffled herself up to the challenge o f a riddle and to the thrill
o f being the center o f attention.
     “Now, when you take yourpost as queen,” asked the king,
“what punishment would you serve to a person who betrayed
you as royalty.forced you to the lowliest oflabors, humiliated
you, and threatened to kill you i f you spoke a word. ”
                    The Problem o f Contact w ith lh e Anim us                        49 ^



             “You ask me what punishment merits a servant who thus
         threats h er queen?” she asked in brazen confidence. "Why
         such a scoundrel deserves afate no better than to be stripped
         naked infront o f the town, stuffed into a barrei studded with
         nails, hamessed to two white horses, and dragged through
         one Street after the next until she is dead. ”
            “A truly noble answer with which I hèartily agree,”
         answered the king, “and a better sentence His Majesty him-
         self could not pronounce. I must say that we will always
         rem em ber the wisdom o f this, your one truly royal decree. It
         shall befulfilled to the letter, m y maiden, and this at once.”
            And off she was dragged, howling into the city square,
         desperately trying to understand what had gone wrong. Soon
         she was standing on a platform above the crowd, flailing
         about, trying to hide h er bountiful nakedness as the roar o f
         the crowd reached ever more inspiring leveis o f jubilation.
             One could soon hear the clippity-clopping o f white
         horses’ hooves and the thudding w rench and bounce o f the
         barrei battering along in the streets, while the nuptial ban-
         quet was celebrated with grandetir, grace, and love. With the

 representing the animus in his positive asp ect. T h e king would be
 seen as the animus in its w izened asp ect or as the collective ruling
 principie, and so on.
    Taking a look now at this faiiy tale from the point o f váeW-Qf
 analytícal psychology, we see that the princess has grow n up at t h e
/c o u rt o f a queen, that is, in the realm o f the E ro s principie. W e
 h ear that h er father has long been dead and the only suggestion
 o f the male principie in the original condition is to be found in
 the talking horse, Falada. In o th er w ords, instinct and anim us are
 entirely undifferentiated and appear as one and the sam e. She
 must travei a long distance w ith this contam ination o f instinct
 and animus in ord er to find the p rin ce, h er cou n terp art and true
 animus, and to e n ter the realm o f th e Logos reigned over by the
 old king.
    The Q ueen M other sends h e r forth not only richly equipped
 with a dowry, that is, with all th e gifts and talents that she has
 bestow ed on her, but also with the maid, her shadow, originally in
 its right place as h er servant and follower. But the m other, as an
 experienced w om an and as a m ature personality, knows that this
transitus from one principie to its opposite will be fraught with
 danger. So she takes a small knife, a symbol o f the logos principie
 tow ard which the girl will be journeying, and wounds h erself with
 it. T hus, through sacrifice and pain, she provides h e r daughter
 with th ree drops o f blood, the ju ice o f life, the essen ce o f the
 heart and o f feeling, as an elixir to p ro te ct her in all the dangers
 she m ay m eet.
      I would like to rem ind the re a d e r h ere o f the g reat pow er that
 the blood spirit had over Jean n e F e ry ; he even called-him self
 a god. But in that case, it was a sym ptom that th e a n im u s had
invaded the veiy citadel o f the E ro s principie. H ere, on the con-
 trary, the blood is in its right place and com es from th e body of
 the m other. In this connection, it is also interesting to rem em b er
 that it was by the help o f M ary M agdalene, in one asp ect the great
 lover, that Jean n e was first able to resist her spirits and to begin
 the work o f liberating h erself from th eir domination.
      T h e trouble with the shadow first begins when th e princess
                 The Problem o f Contact with the Anim us



does not insist on th e m aid fetch in g th e w ater from th e stream
while she still had th e blood-sprinkled cloth and was thus in a
position to do so. N ow w e know th at a stream o f w ater. at such
tim es rep resen ts “th e river o f life.” It is only w hen one ap p roach -
es th e challenges o f life that th e shadow is çonstellated. As long
as we keep ou t o f it, it is possible to keep our in n ocen ce and
integrity. B u t w hen it is tim e to step o u t into life, then th e real
personality, which includes th e shadow, is çonstellated. W e can
observe the sam e weakness in ourselves each tim e w e do not take
th e full responsibility for that w hich w e are, or for that w hich the
situation dem ands. W e take th e p ath o f least resistance . ju st as
th e princess did w hen she fetch e d the^water h erself ra th e r than
take the trouble to assert h erself and keep. th e m aid in h e r right
position. B u t we forget th at w e thus lose a p iece of ourselves
which then falls into th e pow er o f the unconscious, in this case
the shadow. This lowers ou r consciousness— as it did that o f the
princess— and th e next tim e ou r attention w anders at the criticai
m om ent, w e then lose our elixir, our p rotection against the p re-
dom inance o f th e shadow, as th e princess lost the blood-sprinkled
cloth. T h e p rotection is veiy beautifully symbolized h ere by the
drops o f blood com ing from th e very h eart o f the E ro s principie.
   W h en th e princess loses this con n ection with the leading prin­
cipie of w om anhood, she delivers h e rse lf into the hands o f h er
own shadow. She has given away the key to h e r position and it fol-
lows, as night th e day, that she m ust give everything else that she
possesses— her dowiy, h e r clothes and even h er m ost valuable
instinct and anim us— into th e hands o f h er shadow, who then
takes over the leading role an d red u ces the prototype o f the ego
to the rank o f h er maid. T h e princess th en does th e only thing she
can do to save h er life. She hurnbly accep ts th e role o f the servant
and prom ises never to tell anyone w hat has happened.
   W h en we have aliowed the shadow to take jover-the xeins.by
neglectin g th e things that w e ought to have done, we can only
follow the exam ple o f the princess and p ractice the virtue of
co m p lete humility. W e m ust see w hat w e have done and accep t
the con seq u en ces on the sam e principie that, in ord er to regain
52                The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



control o f a skidding car, w e m ust s te e r first into the skid. T h ere is
no hope of regaining control over o u r shadow if we m ake m atters
w orse by refusing to see what has happened. T h e princess is wise
enough to a cce p t the situation. She behaved like a goose and she
uncom plainingly becom es a “goose girl.” H e r situation, however,
is now very bad. T h e animus and th e shadow are m arried which,
as we saw, is the w orst thing that can happen. And h ere even her
friendly instinct, Falada, is sent off to the butcher.
   T h e archetypal situation p ortrayed h ere is one which is
frequently set in motion w hen a w om an loses the gam e to h er
shadow. T he shadow not only m a m e s the animus but destroys
the wom an s instinct as well. And ali the princess can rescue is the
head. (Talking to a head is a well-known archetypal motif: W otan
and M im irs head, for instance.) T h e h ead in this case represents,
above ali, the natural mind, a kind o f inexorable ruthless truthful-
ness which exists in every wom an although she usually prefers
to tu m a d eaf ear toward it. (This is the mind we have already
m entioned as Christina A lbertas co u rt o f conscience and as the
parrot, Old Nick, in G reen D olphin C o u n try .) T h e fact that the
princess rescued this mind and allow ed it to speak to h er daily was
the act that in the en d saved the situation. M any a w om an s whole
life depends on w hether she can take this opportunity o r not, for
this is the inner voice th at knows who she is and that will never
allow h er to deceive herself.
   E very m om ing, as the princess drives h er geese under the dark
gateway— the darkest and saddest place in h er via dolorosa— she
greets F alad as head and expresses h e r regret that he m ust hang
th e re .59 H e hails h er as “Young Q u een ” and rem inds h er that her
m other s h eart would break if she knew what had happened. In
o th er words, he pulls h e r up in h e r sin o f having taken the path
o f least resistance and rem inds h er that h er humilitv as goose
girl is no final solution. H e thus faces h er with h er w ho!e_real-
ity which, as Jung emphasizes in Psychology a n d A lchem y, is
the thing that we fear the m ost.60 As w e are especially told, the

princess was very hum ble and th erefore hated to assert h erself
with the maid. B u t she simply can n ot leave h er opposite quali­
ties— p rid e and worldly am bition— in th e hands o f h er shadow
or they will inevitabJy destroy her. She m ust rem em b er who she
is and take th e responsibility fo r h er position, o r she will break
h er m o th e r’s h eart, that is, kill both th e very essence o f her being
and the fem inine principie o f E ro s. This fairy'tale, also shows us
a very beautiful p iece o f the archetypal foundations o f the whole
invaluable technique o f holding conversations with our animus.
If we can get things straight with our own unconscious, if we can
reach the in n er truth, it will often radiate out into the ou ter world
and set things straight th ere in a way th at we could never reach
by oth er m eans.
   W h en th e princess has passed through the dark gateway o f
suffering and allowed the voice o f truth to reach her, she has
gathered sufficient strength to m eet th e further travails o f the
day w ithout fear, She must herd h e r geese, that is, keep those
fluttering, snattering, and militant animais together, see that they
get enough food and drink, and not al}ow any o f them go astray.
G eese are co n n ected with N em esis. for instance, the goddess o f
fate, and with the Bussian arch-w itch B ab a Yaga. T h e princess,
through losing the blood-sprinkled cloth, has lost h er con n ec-
tion with the positive m oth er figure, thus it m ay just have been
inevitable th at she m ust b ecom e the servant o f a negative m oth er
figure and h erd h er geese.
   T h e story o f com bing h e r h air contains som ething o f the
sam e idea. In this case, h e r individual hairs w ould rep resen t h er
thoughts. And C on rad , as th e infantile and irresponsible ani­
m us, naturally does everything h e can to g et h er thoughts into
his p ow er and to pursue them for his own en d ; that would b e,
for in stan ce, to fill h e r with anim us opinions. She lost the gam e
to h e r shadow on h er jou rn ey to h e r positive animus and she
m ust now d eal with him in a less favorable asp ect. Through h er
conversations with F alad a, she rem ains in touch with enough
o f the forces o f n atu re to help m ake it possible for the wind
to assist h e r by blowing C o n rad s cap away every m orning so
54               The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



that he has to atten d to his own affairs and she can arrange h er
thoughts u nm olested in p eace. T h e wind is perhaps the m ost
prim ordial im age that exists o f th e spirit p e r se, and h ere again
w e get a w onderful glim pse into th e archetypal background
o f our p rob lem .61 W e see th at th e negative, infantile, teasing
animus is pow erless against th e spirit itself and that, if we can
rea ch th ese depths in our p sych e, w e can reach pow ers th at can
help us w hen we are unable to help ourselves. I f th e princess,
as the prototyp e o f the ego, had relied on rational and conscious
m eans, she could only have q u arreled w ith C on rad , and he
would certainly have b een able to obtain som e o f h e r hairs. This
shows us that the d irect way o f argu m en t with the anim us is
often unwise and only results in opinions and a hopeless feeling
o f defeat. F u rth e rm o re , it gives us som e idea o f the total effort
w hich is req u ired on the long p ath of reaching a m odus vivendi
with ou r animus.
    It is interesting that C onrad, w hen he is defeated in his plans,
is the one who makes the m atter known to the king at co u rt. T h us
Conrad is indirectly the m eans tow ard th e solution. H e re w e see
the dual role o f th e animus particularly clearly. If the princess
had given way to this childish, teasing, and foolish aspect o f her
animus and allowed him to steal h er hair, she would have been in
the sam e position as Jeanne F e iy at the beginning o f h er posses-
sion w hen she, apparently harmlessly, accep ted the “apples and
w hite bread” from the father figure. T h e princess would thus have
taken the first step on a similar road to Jeanne F e ry and, if she
had failed to pull herself to geth er and turn to Falada, the appar­
ently harm less, if teasing, C onrad may soon have taken on a m ore
negative or even infernal aspect. But, as she standsJier-ground,
C onrad is obliged to apply to a higher authority and the positive
side o f the animus begins to co m e into play.
   This gives us som e idea o f th e vital issues that are lying con-
cealed behind the apparently unim portant m atter o f the thoughts

61. Barbara Hannah writes: I would like to mention just one well-known example of "the
rushing mighty wind” that preceded the cloven tongues of fire when the spirit entered the
Apostles at Pentecost (Acts 2:2fí).
                    The Problem o f Contact with the Animus            55



which pass through o u r mind as we go about our daífy life. E very
tim e we give way to an animus opinion, w e are allowing ou r little
C onrad to steal a hair and thus we are m oving im perceptibly but
surcly in the directíon o f Jean n e Fery. W h ereas each tim e w e can
think o f a way o f preventing this theft, o f resisting the insinuating
animus opinion, w e m ove a step n earer to the solution which is
waiting for us ali— as it was for th e princess— although in each
individual case it com es in a different form .
   W h en the king had tested C on rad s statem ents by concealing
him self and listening to the girls conversation with F alad a, and
after he had seen the wind grant h e r request, he sent for the
goose girl and asked h er to tell him h er stoiy. She kept faith with
th e shadow, however, and refused to break h er oath o f silence.
This also gives us a valuable hint as to ou r dealings with our own
shadow side. A great m any people rnake_ th e m istake o f believ-
ing that one can integrate. th e . shadow. by deliberately living its
qualities. B u t this. m istak e.o n ly Jead s to identification with the
shadow._We ch an ge roles, so to speak, and nothing is gained. But
by keeping faith with the shadow, as th e princess does h e re , we
gran t it its right to exist and pay o u r debt to it. For, after ali, the
m aid had sp ared the princess s life w hen she had it in h er pow er
to utterly destroy her.
   T h e king then persuades the princess to crawl into the iron
stove and to tell it h er troubles. T h e stove h ere presents the
m o th ers w om b into w hich she m ust cre e p for rebirth or the
alchem ical stove w here the p rocess o f transform ation takes
p lace.62 H e re the princess m ay speak, for she lays h er faith in the
hands o f the Self so th at it, and not the ego, m ay decide. She also
opens h erself to the possibilities o f a transform ation so that the
king, who has listened through th e stovepipe, can now reestab-
lish h e r in the royal rank to which she was born. H e dresses h er
in royal apparel and arranges the w edding feast so that, at last,
after m uch tribulation and error, she reach es th e positive animus
figure in the person o f th e Idngs son.

      T h e false bride— the shadow— sits on his o th er side at the
 feast and pronounces h er own punishm ent under the impression
 that she is condem ning som eone else. T h e shadow thus over-
 reaches itself and has to subm it to being depotentiated. She is
 dragged naked in a barrei though the streets until she is dead, that
/i s , she is redueed to an inanim ate shadow that follows the ego as
 the ordinaiy shadow follows the body. (This m otif shows a differ-
 en ce betw een the archetypal events in faiiy tales and individual
 cases. Archetypes never really die, so the death o f an archetype
 m eans transform ation.) But the princess, as th e bride o f the kings
 son, m ust take over the responsibility for who she is and not allow
 h er naturally retiring disposition to mislead h er again into playing
 only a portion o f h er role.

 T he fairy tale has shown us an infinitesimal fragm ent o f the.inex-
 haustible com binations and possibilities which lie con cealed -in
 the archetypal foundation o f every individual. As Jung says in his
 epilogue to his article, “T h e Psychology o f the T ransference”:


        The series of pictures [from the Rosariumn Philosophorum]
        that serve as our “Ariadne thread” is one of many, so that we
        could easily set up several other working models which would
        display the process of transference each in a different light.
        But no single model would be capable of fully expressing the
        endless wealth of individual variations which ali have their
        raison d ’etre.<Xi


      T h e sam e applies to any story that one may attem pt to use as
 an “A riadne th read ” in the problem o f con tact with the animus.
 T h e endless wealth o f individual variations which e ach o f us
 m eets in our effort to m ake th e acquaintance o f the anim us (as
 well as in our negotiations with h im ).are simply inexhaustible. In
 a paper o f this length, it would be a hopeless task to show him

th ere is always a g reat tem ptation to identify with the details of
th e o th e r p erson ’s life and thus take things out o f th eir context
and apply th em in the w rong place.
   In conclusion, I w ould like to retu rn for a m om en t to our own
e ra and give you a fragm ent o f a m odern d ream w hich shows the
sam e problem in new clothes. It is p art o f a very interesting series
w hich illustrates th e conflict b etw een th e collective point of view
o f th e animus and the intensely personal standpoint o f the shad­
ow. It is w orth m entioning th at th e d ream er was n ot in analysis,
w hich m eans that th e m aterial is then m o re naive and com plete.
   This d ream er was constantly torn in two in h e r dream s
betw een an inexorably severe animus (who usually appeared
as a m onk or a priest) and a passionate, childish shadow (who
appeared as a child o r an excitable em otional w om an). On the
one hand, she had to accep t th e ju st rem onstrances o f the inexo-
rable animus, while on the other, she had to low er h erself to the
level o f th e shadow against th e express orders o f the priest. In
th e dream , from which I am taking th e following text, she was
obliged to rem ain standing in the p resen ce of the priest but nev-
ertheless sank down onto a b en ch b eside a despairing woman.
She says that. she did not forget h er cle a r obligation to rem ain
standing, n o r did she a ct from defiance, b u t she was com pelled
by a com passion g re a te r than h erself to sit down beside this
wom an. She then looked at th e p riest and th ere was m ercy in his
face, b u t she knew he would punish h e r severely for w hat she had
done. W h en th e tension was at. its height, she found h erself in a
g reat cath ed ral with th e p riest behind h er and the w om an she
had befrien d ed in front o f her. T h ey w ere all waiting for som e­
thing, seem ingly for som e sort o f ju d gm en t or decision. At last, a
voice was h eard com ing from behind and above the priest. This
voice was as m ajestic as th e cath ed ral itself, and they all listened
 58             The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



in both fear and gladness. T h e voice was full o f com passion and
y et the judgm ent was severe: “I f the child (or passionate w om an)
recov ered from h er wounds, th e d ream er m ight go h e r way in
p eace, but if not . . . .” T h e d ream er could not h ear th e altem a-
tive, but the inference was that it was a sentence o f death. Severe
/justice was thus tem p ered with m ercy in a way w hich could be
 accep ted by them all.
    I need add little to this w onderful dream , w hich shows us
how ego, animus, and shadow m u st all sacrifice them selves to the
will o f the Self. B u t the first sacrifice m ust com e from the side
o f the ego w hich m ust m ake conscious all its egotistical demands
p rojected onto the shadow. F o r as Jung said in his Eranos lecture
on “T he Process ofT ran sform ation in the M ass,” w e can only sac­
rifice the things w e have.64 It is only if w e are willing to make the
utm ost sacrifice ourselves that w e can hope to m ove our animus
to sacrifice his autonom y and his au tocratic pow er over us and
to low er him self to b ecom e a function betw een conscious and
unconscious, subservient to the voice that com es from behind and
above him, the voice o f the u n iter o f opposites, w h eth er we call
it God o r the Self.

 possession and a lengthy accou n t o f the subsequent exorcism
 w ere w itnessed by m any well-known people and d ocu m en ted
  in detail by F e r y herself. T h e d o cu m en t, o f w hich I have a pho-
  tostat from the B ibliotheque N ational de F ra n ce , w en t im m e-
/ diately into several editions an d was translated into G erm an at
 that tim e.
    P ossessed already as a child and living a com p lete fantasy life
 with several negative animus figures (called dem ons), Jeanne
 had to renew h er vows o f o b ed ien ce to them w hen she was
 twelve. A ccording to Fery, th ese dem ons gave h er' m any appar-
 en t advantages, such as making h er clever and witty, so that she
 could impress h er environm ent, although she could n ot relate to
 it. She also said they gave h er rich food. It may seem surprising
 that these dem ons allowed h er to take h er vows as a nun, but this
 perm ission was only for w hat th ey could get out o f it. T hey m ade
 h er renounce the vows she had taken that very sam e evening and
 m ade h er renew h e r vows o f implicit obedience to them .
       It was F e ry ’s o^wn conviction that greed and ambition w ere the
 cause o f h e r originally becom in g th eir victim, and it was also the
 first step in h er release. W h en she h eard the oth er nuns praising
 Christ, she w on d ered if she should not have him— as well as h er
 o^wn “gods.” The dem ons had always m ade h er steal pieces of
 the host, and now they m ade h e r go even further and stab a host
 w afer with a knife. The room was im m ediately filled w ith.a bright
  radiance and the dem ons fled scream in g in terror.
     They then behaved with a tw isted duplicity ^typical o f the
  negative animus. They rep roach ed h e r for not having worshipped
  Christ while ignoring the fact th at th ey had always forbidden her
  to do so. And they assured h er he was also their god although they
 had taught h er to despise a god who could not save him self from
 the cross. T h eir reproach was so incessant that they drove Jeanne
  to the verge o f suicide.
      It was soon noticed that th ere was som ething w rong with this
  nun. Jeanne’s possession was acknow ledged, and the Archbishop
  o f Cam brai, Louis de Berlaym ont, im m ediately started the exor-

only from the archbishop but also from the priests w ho served
as his assistants. T h e first hopeful sign was w hen Jean n e threw
h erself at th e feet o f the archbishop (in essen ce, acknow ledging
h e r tran sferen ce to him for the first tim e).2 M ary M agdalene then
appeared in a vision and gradually took over the w hole exorcism .
     Incredible efforts w ere d em an d ed from the archbishop. At one
point, h e was forced by M ary M agdalene to take the nun into his
house, w h ere she stayed for a year in the face o f the m ost spiteful
gossip from the whole diocese. T he demons slowly gave way, but
the earliest father figure am ong th em was especially tenacious
and claim ed that Jeanne had never spoken a w ord h erself but
that it was h e r spirits who had always spoken through her. I f the
archbishop insisted on exorcising him, then she would be reduced
to the state o f a child o f four. T he priests insisted, and this father
figure fulfilled his threat. The archbishop had to teach Jeanne to
read , and he ed u cated h e r from the level o f a four-year-old.3
   D uring this tim e the appearance o f M ary M agdalene b ecam e
increasingly frequent, and at last she announced in the presen ce
o f the bishop that if the oth er exorcists, m any im portant people
from the diocese, and all o f th e nuns w ould m ost fervently pray,
she would finally free Jeanne from h e r evil spirits. And this tim e
th ere w ould be no relapse. T h e prayers w ere arranged and soon
cam e to pass, and Jeanne was eventually able to retu rn to the
norm al life o f h e r convent with the o th e r nuns. T h e archbishop

       to the maiden Diana. Worthless is this thief, armed with the
       malignity of arsenic, from whom the winged youth fleeth,
       shuddering. And though the central Water is his bride, yet
       dare he not display his most ardent love towards her, because
       o f the snares of the thief, whose machinations are in truth
       unavoidable. H ere may Diana be propitious to thee, who
        knoweth how to tame wild beasts, and w hose twin doves

 his chapter on life after death in M em ories, D ream s, Reflections,
 Jung says o f this task-


        The decisive question for man is: Is he related to something
        infinite or not? That is the telling question of his life. Only
         if we know that the thing which truly matters is the infinite
         can we avoid fixing our interest upon futilities, and upon all
         kinds of goals which are not of real importance. Thus we
         demand that the world grant us recognition for qualities
         which we regard as personal possessions: our talent or our
         beauty. The more a man lays stress on false possessions,
         and the less sensitivity he has for what is essential, the less
         satisfying is his life. He feels limited because he has limited
         aims, and the result is envy and jealousy. If we understand
        and feel that here in this life we already have a link with the
        infinite, desires and attitudes change. In the final analysis,
        we count for [being somebody or] something only because
        of the essential we embody, and if we do not embody that,
        life is wasted. In oUr relationships to other men, too, the
 7. Ibid., par. 190.
                               Anim us and Eros



     crucial question is whether an elem ent o f boundlessness is
     expressed in the relationship.
         T h e feeling for the infinite, however, can b e attained only
     if we are bounded to the utmost. T h e greatest limitation for
     man is the “se lf’; it is manifested in the experience: “I am
     o n ly that!” Only consciousness o f our narrow confinement
     in the self forms the link to the limitlessness o f the uncon-
     scious. In such awareness we experience ourselves concur-
      rently as limited and eternal, as both the one and the other.

  is precisely the individual that the anim us tries to “iron o u t,” that

the opposites th a t Ju n g e v e r w ro te , an d I strongly recom m en d

“unconscious” lmowledge, a quasi “perceiving” o f im ages that
constitute form al factors in spontaneous fantasy products. Jung
cites Chuang-tzu:

           “The state in which ego and non-ego are no longer opposed
í         is called the pivot o f Tao . . . . Tao is obscured when you fix
          your eye on little segments o f existence only . . . . Outward
          hearing should not penetrate further than the ear; the intel-
          lect should not seek to lead a separate existence, thus the
          soul can become empty and absorb the whole world. This is
          Tao that fills this emptiness . . . . Use your inner eye, your
          inner ear, to pierce to the heart of things, and have no need
          of intellectual knowledge/’10


         “O ur sulphur” o f th e alchem ists also has a d irect connection
with Venus (a personification o f w om an s principle o f E ro s). Jung
quotes the alchem ist Rosinus (a corruption o f Zosim os):


          Our Venus is not the corpmon sulphur, which bums and is
          consumed with the combustion of the fire and of the corrup­
          tion; but the whiteness of the Venus of the Sages is consumed
          with the combustion o f the white and the red . . . and this
          combustion is the entire whitening . . . of the whole work
          Therefore two sulphurs are mentioned . . . and they rejoice
          in one another, and the one contains the other. 11

Jung com m ents that the rejoicing in ea ch oth er com es from the
famous axiom o f D em ocritu s: “N atu re rejoices in nature, nature

taining th e o th er is an allusion to th e O uroboros.12
    W e see from th e rejoicing o f the two sulphurs in the Philaletha
text that th e “t:J.J1. e sulphur” drives out th e d.est m ctiv e . superflui-
ties. I t is a.sulphur in which th e red (active principie o f th e sun)

union o f th e opposites, the totality, w hich is th e goal o f th e pro-
cess o f alchem y as well as o f psychological individuation.
     Jung gives an oth er referen ce to sulphur and Venus from one
o f the parables in the treatise o f “D e sulphure.” H ere an alche-
m ist is searching for the sulphur, and this quest leads him into
the grove o f Venus w here a voice (Saturn) tells him that Sulphur
has b e e n im prisoned by his own m o th er becau se he had b een too
submissive to her.
   This has a very familiar sound in any psychologists ear. H ow
often have we found too submissive sons being held a p risoner by
the m other. W e even h ear o f m en over forty still living with th eir
m oth ers, quite unable to g et away, and o f m en who lean tow ard
hom osexuality (in h er h on or?) b ecau se, am ong oth er things, they
cannot b e a r to put another w om an “in their m oth ers p lace.”
    T h e voice in the grove o f Venus praises Sulphur as: “T h e arti-
ficer o f a thousand things, as the h eart o f all things, as that which
endows living things with understanding, as the b eg etter o f every
flow er and blossom on herb and tre e , and finally as th e ‘painter
o f all co lo rs.” '13 Jung com m en ts that this description o f sulphur
m ight well be a description o f E ro s itself. So in ou r Philaletha

for m en. M en n e e d th e E ro s side u rgen tlyeven -th ou gh lth ^ ^ ^ ^ in

     Jung also com m ents that th e Rosinus text does not tell us who
;th e m o th er o f sulphur is, but presum ably it was Venus h erself
 who im prisoned h e r mischievous son, Cupid. This is corroborated
by the fact that th e alchem ist did not know he was going to find
Sulphur in th e grove of Venus (the woods usually have a m aternal
significance) and that th e voice is that o f Saturn, who introduces
him self as th e “governor o f th e prison” in w hich Sulphur is cap-
tive.14 L ater, after the voice has disappeared, th e alchem ist falls
asleep and sees a fountain in th e grove of Venus w ith Sulphur
 personified nearby. T he vision ends with the coniunctio, with the
 em b race in th e bath. Jungjcomme^nts--that-V--€nus is-undoubtedly
 the a n w r sapientia (love _ofwisdgm), who..puts_an_e:ad ±o.the_. pro-

dangerous and m ost evil nature (found personified, for instance,
as th e dragon o r th e lion). H e speaks th en o f its resem blance
to th e O uroboros w hose head devours its w hole body. H e also
notes that, according to a G nostic view, C hrist took on the form
o f th e serpent in paradise in o rd er to te a ch A dam and E v e to
discrim inate so that they should see that th e work o f th e dem i-
urge was im p erfect, thus accounting for the im perfections o f
creation . (This G nostic dem iurge was con sidered to be th e world
creator.) Jung then docum ents th e work o f m any alchem ists who
p u t sulphur— as the arcan e substance— on a level with Christ.
T h erefo re th e alchem ists m ost likely m eant som ething similar.
Ju n g com m ents:


       We would tum away in disgust from such an absurdity were
       it not that this analogy sometimes in clear and sometimes
       in veiled form, was thrust upon them by the unconscious.
       Certainly there could be no greater disparity than that
       between the holiest conception kno^n to man’s conscious-
       ness and sulphur with its evil-smelling compounds. The
       analogy therefore is in no sense evidential but can only have
       arisen through intense and passionate preoccupation with
       the chemical substance, which gradually formed a tertiu m
       co m p a r a tio n is in the alchemists mind and forced it upon
       him with the utmost insistence.15


    L ater, Ju n g points out th at th e Self, as a co n cep t o f hum an
totality, is by definition g re a te r than th e ego-personality as it
em b races th e ego as well as th e personal unconscious shadow
and th e collective unconscious. (H e also points out that the
unconscious seem s so unim portant to ego-consciousness that we
are m istrustful and suspicious o f it and have great difficulty in
granting it an autonom ous existen ce.)
   H e n ce th e psychic p h en om en a o f th e Self is as full o f para-
doxes as th e H indu con cep tion o f th e A tm an, w hich on the one

hand em b races the universe and on th e oth er dwells “no bigger
than a thum b in th e h e a rt.” The E a ste rn idea o f A tm an-Purusha
corresponds psychologically to th e W estern figure o f C hrist, who
is th e second person o f the Trinity and G od himself, but, as far
as his hum an existence is co n cern ed , conform s exactly to the
;u f fe r in g servant o f God in Isaiah— from his birth in a stable
^among th e animals to his shameful d eath on the cross betw een
two thieves.16
   To show this paradox even m o re clearly in th e alchem istic
symbol o f sulphur, Jung notes th at this substance was, on the one
hand, one o f the custom ary attributes o f hell (hell is often said to
smell o f sulphur and the devil), and on th e oth er hand it is regard-
 ed as analogous to the m ost sacrosanct figure o f alchem ical phi-
 losophy. In their attem p t to stress its malicious, dangerous, and
uncanny nature, the alchem ists chose th e im ages used for Christ
in th e patristic literature, such as the serpent, lion, eagle, fish, and
so forth. As Jung points out, this strange usage is explained by the
 fact that m ost o f th e patristic analogies have a negative as well as
a positive asp ect.17
    Jung concludes by noting that th e “alchemists had discovered
th e psychological existence o f a shadow w hich opposes and com -
pensates the conscious, positive figure.” 18 H e sums up his chapter
 on sulphur as follows:


           The unconscious dynamism would correspond to sulphur,
           for compulsion is the great mystery o f human life. It is the
           thwarting of our conscious will and of our reason by ' an
           inflammable element within us, appearing now as a consum-
           ing fire and now as life-giving warmth. 19


   Compulsion, therefore, has two sources: the shadow and the
Anthropos. This is sufficient to explain that paradoxical nature o f

sulphur; as th e “corru p ter,” it has affinities w ith th e devil, while
on th e o th e r hand it appears as a parallel o f C h rist.20
   W e can see, m ore or less, w hat Philaletha m eans w hen he
recom m en d s th e usage o f th e "tru e sulphur” in o rd er to cleanse
th e w ater. Com pulsion, on th e one hand, is negative. It is the
concupiscentia, a passionate desire for otdíer j h i n g s . w h eth er

th e realm o f th e shadow w h ich , l é f t t o itself, is apt to be purely

On th e o th e r hand, com pulsion has, a p o i t i ve_eiem ent..w h en

th e fundam ental and eternal. T h ese con stitu te th e tru e basis o f
all o u r desires— although th ese days m ost people seem to act as
if th ey a re en tirely unfon sciou s o f th e fact.
    W e have seen enough o f sulphur and its paradoxical nature to
have a good idea o f th e m eaning o f that “true sulphur” needed to
“clean se th e w ater.” W e also see how sulphur is closely related to
th e con cep t o f th e “own w ater” (“I f thou know est how to m oisten
this dry ea rth w ith its ow n w a t e r . . . . ”). W ith this w ater w e m ust
op en th e pores of our fantasy w hen, for exam ple, in trying to pro-
ce e d with active im agination w e only find stagnation. D iscovering
this text m eant a great deal to m e, for it was a w elcom e confirm a-
tion o f m y own experience. Jung particularly stresses the neces-
sity o f considering what is actually behind all o f o u r passionate
desirousness, or, as M eister E ck h art expresses it: our longing for

the more common usage, meaning avarice, covetousness, sexual desire, and voraciousness,
but intense desire in general and Freud’s pleasure principle, in short: “an emblem of the
vanity of the world and o f earthly principles” (C. G. Jung, Aion, CW, vol. 9ii (Princeton,

ou r “own way.” And h ere w e find a thirsting for the eternal which
can never b e satisfied. Jung w rites:

           The more you cling to that which all the world desires, the
          more you are Everyman who has not yet discovered himself
t         and stumbles through the world like a blind man leading the
          blind with somnambulistic certainty into the ditch. Everyman
          is always a multitude. Cleanse your interest o f that collective
          sulphur which clings to all like a leprosy. For desire only
           burns in order to burn itself out, and in and from this fire
           arises the tru e living s p ir it which generates life according to
          its own laws, and is not blinded by the shortsightedness of
           our intentions or the crude presumption of our superstitious
           belief in the will.22


         O f th e Fo u n t o f the Knight ofT reviso in Philaletha’s text, Jung
says that the fountain is:


          the bath o f renewal . . . . The ever-flpwing fountain expresses
          a continual flow o f interest toward the unconscious, a kind
          of constant attention or “religio,” which might also be called
          d ev o tio n . The crossing o f the unconscious contents into con-
           sciousness is thus made considerably easier, and this is bound
          to benefit the psychic balance in the long run. Diana as the
          numen and nymph of this spring is an excellent formulation
          o f the figure we know as the anima. I f attention is directed to
          the unconscious, the unconscious will yield up its contents,
          and these in tum will fructify the conscious like a fountain of
          living water. 23


         F ro m the Logos— o r th e m an’s point o f view— the m aiden
D iana is the anim a already in h er right place as the facilita-
tive function betw een th e conscious and the unconscious. F o r
w om en, D iana represents personified. E ro s _or t h e S e ] L which

to do it in that way, the positive animus secretly steps back and

     Jung co m m en ts h e re th at th e text turns back to the th ief at
this point, indicating th e sh eer difficulty o f cleansing th e w ater
from “leprous filth,” a real “labor o f H e rcu les.”25 H e speaks o f the
th ief as “a kind o f self-robbery” and notes th at this com es from
bad habits in ou r thinking (in the w om an, o f having opinions),
which are unfortunately supported by tradition and ou r milieu.

 and touched with the hands, is w orthless or is even declared non-
 existent. T h erefore we constantly u n derestim ate o r deny the soul.
 Jung notes th e ten d en cy for th e situation to w orsen when, in the
 hands o f m aterialistic philosophers, m an is red u ced to but a herd
 animal with exclusive recognition o f the categories o f hunger,
/pow er, and sex. H e writes that w hen we succum b to th e hubris o f
 thinking in term s o f thousands and millions o f units:


        then naturally there are no questions more important than
        whom the herd belongs to, where it pastures, whether
         enough calves are born and sufficient quantities o f milk
         and meat are produced. In the face of huge numbers every
        thought o f individuality pales, for statistics obliterate every-
        thing unique . . . . Yet the real carrier of life is the individual.
         He alone feels happiness, he alone has virtue and responsibil-
        ity and any ethics whatever. The masses and the state have
        nothing of the kind. Only man as an individual being lives;
        the state is just a system, a mere machine for sorting and
        tabulating the masses. Anyone . . . who thinks in terms o f men
        minus the individual, in huge numbers, atomizes him self and
        becomes a thief and a robber to himself. He is infected with
        the leprosy of collective thinking and has become an inmate
         of that insalubrious stud-farm called the totalitarian State.
         Our time contains and produces more than enough o f that
         “crude sulphur” which with “arsenical malignity” prevents
         man from discovering his true self.26


    As we know, for w om en, it is th e animus above all who per-
 suades us to be an E verym an , to care for the collective and
ignore the individual. H e re we see th e vital im p ortan ce o f th e
tru e sulphur, which the alchem ists even describe as “th e b eg etter
 o f every flow er and blossom on h erb and tre e ” and finally as the
 “painter o f all colors”; in o th er w ords, o f E ro s which drives out
 and replaces the opinions o f the anim us.27 T h at is, E ro s leads the

         I was in Chichester Cathedral, where there used to be an
          unfinished chapel with its reserve o f building stones and so
         forth. Here I met the devil and said to him: “What a mess you
          are making o f the world with the war.” He said, “Excuse me,
         this is not my fault, it is yours.” I declined that responsibility,
         and he answered with something like: “O f course, I do not
f
         mean you personally, I mean women, because women can
         deal with the dark side and with evil and, since they dont, it
         gets into the hands o f men wh:_o anyway can’t deal with the
         darker sides of life. I f the women worit try, then there are
         bound to be wars.”


   Jung_speaksjof th e j).r s e n ic ,”. o r rather, the “arsenicalm.rnalig-

tions, that it by no m eans belongs exclusively to the masculine

rather_to_the......mioo]! than^to_t:pe sun.30 I f it is accep ted by con­
sciousness— in w om en s psychology, if she is doing all she can to
know h e r animus— then it works positively; if not, th en it works
negatively and destructively. I f the figure is split into two— as it
is h ere with the winged youth and th e thief— it m eans that it is
partly accep ted and partly rejected . B oth aspects are personified
and th erefore are taken for two different things.

    Jung goes on to point ou t that the winged youth represents the
true sulphur, “the spirit o f inner truth which m easures m an not by
his relation to the mass but by his relation to the m ystery o f the
p syche.”31 B u t the youth is obviously aw are o f his o^wn weakness,
and shuddenng, he just flies away from the cru d e sulphur. The

nificance o f a profound tru th that saves it. It is so small th at no
one would notice if it w ere gone . . . w ere it n ot th e conditio sine
q u a n o n o f in n er p eace and happiness.
     T he invisibility o f the winged youth should not be overlooked.
In th ese days when th e totalitarian state is apparently encroaching
and gaining ground everyw here, one cannot help som etim es won-
dering w hat would happen if it gained pow er over our o^wn hom es?
H ow could we m eet it? Should it be approved w hen it would prob-
ably soon destroy us? Should one m ake concessions? It seem s to
m e th ere is a third way for those o f us who realize the pow er of
active imagination. W e can oppose it in that way, enduring th e ten -
sion b etw een the opposites, which will have far m ore effect than
any ou ter action. And h ere w e are helped by the invisibility of the
winged youth. W e can do active im agination and try to withstand
the tension betw een the opposites without our opponents knowing
that w e are opposing them . In the last resort, says Jung, it is:


       neither the “eighty-million strong nation” nor the State that
       feels peace and happiness, but the fndividual. Nobody can
       ever get round the simple computation that a million [zeros]
       in a row do not add up to one, just as the loudest talk can
       never abolish the simple psychological fact that the larger
       the mass, the more nugatory is the individual.32


     N o r is th e m ass m an ever able to add up to m ore than zero.
B y believing in such fictions w e lose o u r own souls, that all-
im p ortan t treasure which is th reaten ed by, am ong other things,
th e m aterialism o f our age. Jung often said th at w hen you get
even on e h u n d red people together, th ey b eco m e little m ore than
a large h ead filled with nothing but steam .
    T h e shy and delicate youth stands for everything that is
w inged in th e psyche o r that would like to sprout wings. B ut if
it dies from th e poison o f m ass m indedness, th en “the individual

 the nam e for this is war.”33
    I hope it has b een clear that, in this warning against th e poi-
 sonous conviction that “th e mass o f mankind is m ore im portant
  than th e individual,” Jung has b een describing the nature o f both
/ the leprosy and how the th ief works. F ro m the w om ans point o f
  view, w e see h ere how th e animus works w hen h e is granted free-
 dom to create his facts and opinions on the outside and not forced
 to search constantly for the inner truth.
     As w e saw, the positive animus is not m uch help on this point.
 F o r he just escapes, shuddering from what he considers to be the
 appalling fact that the thief, w hen purged from his extraneous
 character, will turn out to be his own dark shadow.
    T h e text continues: “A n d th o u gh the central W ater is his
 b rid e, yet d a re h e not display his ^nwst a rd en t love tow ards
 her, b eca u se o f the sna res o f th e thief, w hose m achinations a re

 higher ideal, th e banal im p ortan ce o f food and w arm th as the
 foundation o f bare existence cannot be denied. D esp ite his
 knowledge o f th e m ystery of th e living soul— that conditio sine
 qua n o n o f a m eaningful life saved from the overw helm ing pow er
 and brutality o f collective convictions— th e w inged youth can ­
 not afford to escape his earthly, shadow opposite. Things cannot
 prosp er if th e opposites are so com p letely separated as they are
 at this point in our text. W e can n ot afford to do nothing and leave
 it all up to th e unconscious, fo r th en the opposites will fly apart
 or increasingly battle.
     It is very noticeable that th e decisive fight betw een the
 opposites is b etw een two m ale figures— evidently not only in
 Philalethas text (Philaletha was, o f course, a m an). W h at is o f
 interest to us h ere is that this fight is betw een two m ale figures
 in his unconscious and not b etw een th e m asculine and feminine,
 betw een th e m an and his anima. M y own experience goes to show
 that exactly the sam e thing happens in wom en. An analysis usually
 begins by working on the shadow and later our whole attention
 33. Ibid., par. 197.

is justifiably on the animus. B u t very often the last enem y, the
real th ief and opponent o f the process o f individuation, is a piece
o f th e shadow that has escap ed ou r notice. T hose o f you who
h eard A ndrea D yke’s rep o rt on h e r thesis will re m e m b e r th at the
w ord d a n g e r to C ecilia cam e from th e w itch and not the animus.
Owing to h e r hush-hush tactics, it is the w itch w ho often escapes
the w om an’s n otice. O f cou rse, the w itch is secretly encouraging
the negative animus— she is even m arried to him in extrem e
cases. B u t h ere it is the m asculine th ief w ho has stopped up and
poisoned the very source o f Philalethas unconscious without him
knowing it. In w om en, it is often a feminine figure who plays this
role within her. Such a fem inine figure— in C ecilia’s case, the
w itch— seem s even m ore difficult to d ete ct than the opinions o f
th e animus. O ne is then faced with the task o f finding h er behind
the anim us as she secretly en cou rages him in h e r opinions.
   Ju n g says o f this pair, th e w inged youth and th e thief:


        It is the age-old drama o f opposites, no matter what they are
        called, which is fought out in every human life. In our text it
        isobviously the struggle between the good and the evil spirit,
        expressed in alchemical language just as today we express it
        in conflicting ideologies.34


     H e re I w ould like to rem in d you o f w hat Jung on ce said in
a discussion at th e Psychological Club in Z ü rich w hen asked
if th ere w ould be an atom ic war. H e replied th at he thought it
w ould d ep en d on how m any people cou ld w ithstand the tension
o f the opposites in them selves. I f enough cou ld w ithstand this
tension, h e thou gh t ato m ic w ar m ight ju st b e avoided. (H ere

     It is the winged youth who is b etroth ed to the central water,
  the fountain o f wisdom, th e sou rce o f the in n er life. T h e winged
  youth is evidently Sol and the cen tral w ater is L u n a , and he will
  n ever be whole until he has m arried her. H owever, as his fear
  o f the th ief separates him from her, it is clear th at h e m ust first
I accep t his opposites right to existence before he can approach
  his bride. W h en he finds th e cou rage to do this— w hen w e have
  found the bit o f ou r shadow that is secretly thw arting us— th en he
  will have all the qualities that will enable him to win her. H ere we
  have the union o f opposites in potentia, but it only becom es real
  if m ortal and im m ortal can be united.
      Clearly the thief— through accep tan ce m ade relative— has
  to be included if the union in ou r actual lives is to be real.
  Particularly if w e are intuitive types, w e so often fly with the
  w inged youth, ignoring o r escaping from our oth er side, and then
  we have not really achieved anything at all.
       From . o.ur_point,ofview— th at is, the point o f view o f feminine
  psychology— Jung often^said thatJn_dxej^^ms_11ndjactive_.imagina-
  tion the. animus .did first w hatever.the. wfflnan would later have to
  do herself. In o th er words, w e can n ot just passively let the animus
  do it for us w ithout our knowledge. W e have to be conscious that
  this split m ust be seen first in the animus, in our unconscious
  mind, and that later we m ust bring it into reality in our own lives.
  L e t us take, for exam ple, th e idea th at w e really do aspire to indi-
  viduate and wish for this m ore than anything else, but we m ust
  realize at the sam e tim e th at we are m ore afraid o f sh eer individu-
  ation than anything else. I am rem inded h ere o f Ju n gs marvelous
  passage in Psychology a n d A lchem y:


        What is particularly noteworthy here is the consistent
        development of the central symbol [of the center]. We can
        hardly escape the feeling that the unconscious process moves
        spiral-wise round a center gradually getting closer, while the
        characteristics of the center grow more and more distinct. Or
        perhaps we' could put it the other way around and say that
        the center— itself virtually unknowable— acts like a magnet
                                Anim us and Eros



      on the disparate materiais and processes of the unconscious
      and gradually captures them as in a crystal lattice. For this
      reason the center is . . . often pictured as a spider in its web,
      especially when the conscious attitude is still dominated by
      fear o f unconscious processes. But if the process is allowed
      to take its course . . . then the central symbol, constantly
      renewing itself, will steadily and consistently force its way
      through the apparent chaos o f the personal psyche and its
      dramatic entanglements . . . .
          Indeed, it seems as if all the personal entanglements and
      dramatic changes of fortune that make up the intensity oflife
      were nothing but hesitations, timid shrinkings, almost like
      petty complications and meticulous excuses for not facing
      the finality o f this strange and uncanny process of crystal-
      lization. Often one has the impression that the personal
      psyche is running around this central point, like a shy animal,
      at once fascinated and frightened, always in flight, and yet
      steadily drawing nearer.36
                           1

w e have to bring them to g eth er m ore or less intellectually as a
prologue to a com plete union with our o^wn shadow, o f conscious-
ness and th e unconscious.
   Ju n g says that the actual m eaning o f the union o f opposites
transcends hum an imagination.


      Therefore the worldly-wise can dismiss such a “fantasy”
      without further ado . . . . But that doesn’t help us much, for
      we are dealing with an eternal image, an archetype, from
      which man can tum his mind for a time but never perma-
      nently. Whenever this image is obscured, his life loses its
      proper meaning and consequently its balance. So long as

       he knows that he is the carrier o f hfe and that it is therefore
       important for him to live, then the mystery o f his soul lives
       also— no matter whether he is conscious o f it or not. But ifh e
       no longer sees the meaning of his hfe in its fulfillment, and no
       longer believes in man’s eternal right to this fulfillment, then
       he has betrayed and lost his soul, substituting for it a mad-
       ness which leads to destruction, as our time demonstrates so
                37




     Ju n g th en turns to th e sta tem en t in th e text that says that the
m achinations o f th e th ie f are unavoidable and som ehow we m ust
co m e to grips w ith this form o f evil. In th e ch a p te r on his “L ate
T h ou gh ts” in his m em oir, h e ^ i t e s :


       Light is followed by shadow, the other side o f the Creator.
       This development reached its peak in the twentieth century.
       The Christian world is now truly confronted by the principle
       o f evil, by naked injustice, tyranny, lies, slavery and coercion
       o f conscience. This manifestation of naked evil has assumed
       apparently permanent form in the Russian nation; but its first
       violent eruption came in Germany. The outpouring o f evil
       revealed to what extent Christianity has been undermined
       in the twentieth century. In the face o f that, evil can no lon­
       ger be minimized by the euphemism of the p r iv a tio b o n i.
       Evil has become a determinant reality. It can no longer. be
       dismissed from the world by a circumambulation. We must
       learn how to handle it, since it is here to stay. How we can live
       with it without terrible consequences cannot for the present
       be conceived.38


G ood and evil w ithin ourselves, h e notes:


       are an integral part o f the fateful drama o f opposites, just as
       the shadow belongs to the light . . . . Evil cannot be eradicated

      once and for all; it is an inevitable component of life and is
      not to be had without paying for it [directly or indirectly].
      The th ief whom the police do not catch has, nonetheless,
      robbed himself, and the murderer is his own executioner.39


To th ese observations, h e adds:


      Therefore the individual who wishes to have an answer to
      the problem o f evil, as it is posed today, has need first and
      foremost of self-knowledge, that is, the utmost possible
      knowledge o f his o^n wholeness. He must know relentlessly
      how much good he can do, and what crimes he is capable
      of, and must beware o f regarding the one as real and the
      other as illusion. Both are elements within his nature, and
      both are bound to come to light in him, should he wish— as
      he ought— to live without self-deception or self-delusion.40

chological necessity o f ceasing to p ro ject th e shadow, as is being
sham elessly done by th e w inged youth:

      One realizes, first o f all, that one cannot project ones shadow
      on to others, and next that there is no advantage in insisting
       on [another’s] guilt, as it is so much more important to know
       and possess ones own, because it is part o f one’s own self
       and a necessary factor without which nothing in this sublu-
      nary world can be realized. Though it is not said that Luna
      personifies the dark side, there is as we have seen something
      very suspicious about the new moon. Nevertheless the
      winged youth loves his moon-bride and hence the dark-
      ness to which she belongs, for the opposites not only flee

      one another but also attract one another. We all lmow that
      evil, especially if it is not scrutinized too closely, can be very
      attractive, and most o f all when it appears in idealistic garb.
      Ostensibly it is the wicked thief that hinders the youth in his
      love for the chaste Diana, but in reality the evil is already
      lurking in the ideal youth and in the darlmess o f the new
      moon, and his chief fear is that he might discover himself in
      the role of the common sulphur. This role is so shocking that
      the noble-minded youth cannot see him self in it and puts the
      blame on the wiles o f the enemy.42


H ere he m ust stop being so childish and dare to know him self
w here— and to whom— th e dark side obviously belongs.
   T he text continues: H e re m ay D iana b e propitious to thee,
w ho know eth how to tam e w ild beasts. H ere we are directly told
that Diana, as th e symbol o f E ro s, is the only one w ho can help
us. W e cannot unite th e opposites w ithout E ro s, and m oreover it
is only she who can tam e th e wild beasts in us. As m any o f you
know from experience, certainly for w om en, it is only love that
can give us th e incentive to tam e ou r wild beasts, n ot only our
personal rages and desires, but also th e ten d en cy to tu m away
from the light o f the opposites in th e individual and let ourselves
be possessed by mass m indedness.
   W e com e now to                         o f D iana who will tem p er
the malignity o f the a ir w ith th eir w ings. Jung says th at, as a th e-
riom orphic symbol, it would b e possible to interpret th e d o e s
“from above downward,” and indeed w e know now from Konrad
Loren z that in reality doves a re often very cru el to each oth er and
anything but p eacefu l.43 B u t Jung says th at it would b e w rong to
interp ret th em negatively th at way h ere, for they are m eant as
th e symbol o f innocence and m arital love, o f the hieros gam os
in its highest form , for instance, C hrist and his virgin m other.
Christ always speaks o f doves in a positive way, for instance: “B e
ye wise as serpents and harm less as doves” (M att. 1 0 :1 6 ). All o f

       It is obviously a moment of supreme possibilities both for
       good and evil. Usually, however, it is first one :and then
       th e other: the good man succumbs to evil, the sinner is
       converted to good, and that, to an uncritical eye, is the end
       o f the matter. B ut those endowed with a finer moral sense
        or deeper insight cannot deny that this seeming one-after-
        another is in reality a happening o f events side-by-side,
        and perhaps no one has realized this more clearly than St.
        Paul, who knew that he bore a thorn in the flesh and that
        the m essenger of Satan smote him in the face lest he be
        “exalted above measure.” The one-after-anothejr is a bear-
        able prelude to the deeper knowledge o f the side-by-side,
        for this is an incomparably more dif f i cult problem. Again,
        the view that good and evil are spiritual forces outside us,
        and that man is caught in the conflict between them, is
        m ore bearable by far than the insight that the opposites
         are the ineradicable and indispensable preconditions of
         all psychic life, so much so that life itself is guilt. Even a
         life dedicated to God is still lived by an ego which speaks
         of an ego and asserts an ego in God’s despite, which does
         not instantly merge itself with God but reserves for itself a
         freedom and a will which it sets up outside God and against
         him. How ca n it do this against the overwhelming might
         of God? Only through self-assertion, which is as sure o f its
         free will as Lucifer. All distinction from God is separation,
         estrangement, a falling away.44

 88               The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



    In a seminar, Jung on ce said that doubt was the cro -^ o f life
 and that all certain ty was m erely on e-sid ed. F o r in uncertainty
 and doubt, truth and e rro r com e together. D ou b t is life, truth is
 often stagnation and death. W h en you are in doubt, you have the
  greatest opportunity to unite the dark and the light sides o f life.45
/ And indeed in my experience the m ost difficult thing to stand is
 never being s u re one was right in a decision. O ne m u st decide,
 and once decided, one m ust support on eself in the decision, and
 yet at the sam e tim e one m ust stand th e fact that one m ay have
 been quite wrong. Som ew here, as Jung told m e years before I
 understood this experience, one knows one had to decide that
 way, y et the doubt is ju st as real; one m ay have decided wrong.
 D irectly w hen one is too sure, th en only one opposite is being
 considered. T h at, as far as I understand it, is a tru e aspect o f the
 incom parably m ore difficult problem o f experiencing the oppo­
 sites side by side.
     Evidently the “malignity o f the air” caused by the th ief has
 been tem p ered by the wings o f D iana’s doves. In o th er words,
 E ro s has prevailed sufficienüy for the hieros ga^rrws to proceed,
 for the text continues: so that the youth easily entereth in through
 the pores, a n d instantly shaketh the fo u n d a tio n s o f the earth, a nd
 raiseth u p a dark clo u d .46
     Through the propitiousness o f D iana and h e r twin doves,
 E ros is sufficiently able to facilitate the relationship betw een the
 winged youth and his own dark side (the thief) so th at the youth
 is able to overcom e his fear and have the courage to approach
 and unite with the bride w hom he loves m ost ardently. M oreover,
 D iana’s doves have tem p ered the m alignity o f the air with their
 wings. T h at m eans that they have m ade the sh eer evil o f the thief
 relative so that the union o f consciousness and shadow could take
 place as the necessary prologue to the far d eep er union betw een
 the m ale and the fem ale, sun and m oon, spirit and earth. This

      T he renow ned Sinologist R ich ard W ilhelm tells the story o f
  a rainm aker from the province o f Schantung who was asked to
  com e to Kiautschou, w here a severe drought had long oppressed
  the land. As soon as the m an arrived he asked that a small hut
  be built for him at the edge o f the city. W h en the hut was com -
  pleted he m oved in with the request that nobody disturb him.
  H e rem ained in this hut th ree days and th ree nights, and on the
  m orning o f th e fourth day a snow storm broke over the city, a type

o f storm th at nobody had e v er exp erien ced at th at tim e o r season
o f th e year. W h en W ilhelm h eard this story h e w ent to visit the
rainm aker and asked him how he had m anaged to m ake it snow.
T h e m an answ ered th at it was not he w ho had m ade it snow. H e
was simply th e p erson w ho had co m e from Schantung w h ere
everything was m ore or less in order. H e re in K iautschou, howev-
er, heaven and earth w ere separated, everything was wrong, and
h e n eed ed th ree days and nights ju st to get him self in order. And
in th e m om en t when he finally was able to get him self in order,
then it began to rain and snow.48
   R eferrin g to W ilhelm ’s story o f th e rainmaker, M arie-L ou ise
von F ra n z recen tly p oin ted o u t th at th e m an had rea ch e d th e
condition o f Tao w hen he to u ch ed this arch etyp e in th e col­

far-reach in g effect.
    It is interesting th at th e first resu lt o f th e hiero s ga^mos, th e
sa cre d m arriage, is to. shake th e e a rth to its foundations and p ro -
du ce a black cloud. As Ju n g says, it is an “earthing” o f th e spirit
and th e “spiritualizing o f th e e a rth .”49 Naturally, such an enorm ous
chan ge does shake o n e’s previous consciousness to its foundations
and p rod u ces a dark cloud. Consciousness has been darkened but
also widened. O ne can no longer believe in th e victory o f light—
in on e’s good intentions, for instance— b ecause th at is one-sided
thinking, and in th e future w e have to try to w ithstand both the
light a n d d ark side by side.
    I would like to rep eat a story I tell rath er often b ecause I think
it m akes this passage in th e text clearer. M y m oth er died when I
was fifteen, and h er g reat friend, my godm other— a real pillar o f
th e ch u rch and state— th en used to co m e stay with us tw ice a year
with th e excu se that she was com in g "to see if your fath er was

in th e household, so I usually restrained m yself from making the

 father, whose horse had escaped its box and destroyed m y bicycle,
 because he refused to pay a penny o f the expensive repairs. My
  rage m ade m e tell m y god m oth er th e whole story. She looked very
  thoughtful and then asked m e how th e household books w ere han-
  dled: did I have to show them or only give th eir total? It was the
/ latter. “So it is quite sim ple,” she said, “you will simply add £ 1 .0 0 a
  w eek until th e bicycle is paid for.” I gasped and asked if th at would
  not be dishonest? She asked m e not to b e so stupid; it was not a
 m atter of dishonesty, b u t o f how to get on with a difficult man.
    At the tim e, I felt exactly as though the foundations o f my
 earth had b een shaken and a black cloud was obscuring m y p re-
 vious b elief that “honesry was always the b est policy.” W h atever
  I was, I was always undeviatingly honest! M y godm other shud-
  d ered at this Logos conviction and p resen ted m e with the E ro s
  point of view. W h en I recovered , I followed h e r advice, and never
 again did m y father and I have a row about money, w hich then,
 naturally, greatly im proved our daily life and relationship. W h en I
 told Jung this story, he said: “N ow th at was a rem arkable woman.
 I should have liked to have known h er.”             J
    T he text continues: B u t thou wilt lead th e w aters u p even to
 the brightness o f the m oon. Ju n g notes h ere th at w ater has the
  m eaning o f “fructifying in terest,” and this was exactly w hat my
  godm other had done for m e. She had, so to speak, led m y fructi­
  fying interest up to th e m oon, to E ro s, to m y fem inine principle.
  I simply had not known b efore th at th e m ost im portant aspect of
  living with a m an, especially a difficult m an like m y father, was
  to keep life pleasant for him and for myself, and th at this was far
 m ore im portant than indulging m yself in the idiotic illusion of
 being unswervingly honest on such insignificant issues!
    This th e m e o f the w aters bein g led up to the m o o n -—instead of
 up to th e sun— is ra th e r surprising since it is com ing from a man
 and shows th at it arises out o f a d eep er layer o f the unconscious.
 F o r it also fits fem inine psychology perfectly. It is clear that m en
 m ust also b ecom e conscious o f - th eir E ros, w hich first entails
 becom ing conscious o f th eir anima, the m aiden Diana. F a r b etter

m oon. T h e m ild light o f th e m oon is m o re suitable for seeing th e
right way to re la te , w hereas th e pitiless intensity o f th e sun reveals
every o b stacle. As P h ilaleth a was a m an, this m ust th en also be
n ecessary for m en, although it is m u ch m o re clearly o u r way, th e
way o f w om en. You should read w hat Ju n g says about this in “T h e
M o o n -N atu re,” th e next ch a p te r o f M y steriu m C on iu n ctio n is, for
h e re (as th ey say in G erm an ) I ca n only p ick a few raisins o u t o f
th e cak e. O n this th e m e , Jung says:

       The error in our formulation lies in the fact, firstly, that we
       equated the moon with the unconscious as such, whereas the
       equation is true chiefly of the unconscious o f a man; and sec-
       ondly, that we overlooked the fact that the moon is not only
       dark but is also a giver o f light and can therefore represent
       consciousness. This is indeed so in the case o f woman: he.r
       consciousness has a luna_r_ rather .h;i.n_a_solar_ character. Its
       light is the “mild” hght_of t±te moon, .\lllhich merges. things

        unsuspected unity. _
           For purely psychological reasons I have, in other o f my
        writings, tried to equate the masculine consciousness with
        the concept of Logos and the feminine with that of Eros.
        y    Logos I meant &scrimination, judgment,_insight, and by
        Eros I meant the capacityto relate. I regarded both concepts
        as intuitive ideas which cannot be defined accurately or
        exhaustively. From the scientific point of view this is regret-
        table, but from a practical one it has its value, since the two
        concepts mark out a field of experience which it is equally
        difficult to define.50
 50. Ibid., par. 224.
    94                 The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



           Logos and Eros are intellectually formulated intuitive equiv-
           alents of the archetypal images of Sol and Luna. In my view
           the two luminaries are so descriptive and so superlatively
           graphic in their implications that I would prefer them to the
           more pedestrian terms Logos and Eros, although the latter
/          do pin down certain psychological peculiarities more aptly
           than the rather indefinite “Sol and Luna.” The use of these
           images requires at any rate an alert and lively fantasy, and this
           is not an attribute of those who are inclined by temperament
           to purely intellectual concepts. These offer us something fin-
           ished and complete, where as archetypal image has nothing
           but its naked fullness, which seems inapprehensible by the
           intellect. Concepts are coined and negotiable. values; images
           are life.51..


    And finally:


           It needs a very moon-like consciousness indeed to hold a
           large family together regardless of all the differences, jand
           to talk and act in such a way that the harmonious relation of
           the parts to the whole is not only not disturbed but is actually
           enhanced. And where h e ditch.is_toq.deep, a ray of moon-
           liglit sm oothesit over. A.clas_sic _exampleof this is the con-
           cilia^tmy_J2 r^osal_ of St. Catherine_of,Alexandria in Anatole
           France's_P€!.!gYÍt1.$?1r.1d.-_ .The heavenly council had come to
           a deadlock over the question of baptism, since although the
           penguins were animals they had been baptized by St. Mael.
           Therefore she says: ‘T h at is why, Lord, I entreat you to give
           old Mael’s penguins a human head and breast so that they
           can praise you worthily. And grant them also an immortal
           soul— but only a little one.”52

        realm o f the immortals begins, and the gloomy deep can be
        left to its own devices, for the spirit now moves it from within,
        convulses and transforms it.53


 T h e result then is that “the unconscious is no longer so rem ote
 and strange and terrifying” and the w ay has been paved fo r an
 eventual union betw een the conscious and the unconscious.54
     W h e n one rem em b ers that at the beginning o f the text, the
 w hole u nconscious was b locked off from consciousness by an evil
 spirit— th at is, by all o u r animus opinions— so that active im agina-

 sion “animus co coo n ” was originally co in ed by M arie-L o u ise
von F ran z.
   T he animus prob lem is ind eed th e problem p ar excellence for
every m odern woman. It is also a central issue— albeit indirect-
ly— for every m odern m an, for this co n ce p t is a key which unlocks
/ a great m any puzzles for him in his w ifes (or o th er w om ens)
incom prehensible behavior.
   In this lectu re, the anim a will also be discussed as th e coun-
terp art of th e animus. In fact, in one o f th e books I may work on
in this cou rse (T h e Evil V in e y a rd by M arie H ay), the m aterial
continually lends itself to being considered not only from the ani­
 mus but also from th e anim a point o f view.1 D espite this fact, it
 m ust yet be em phasized th at th e two are so d ifferent th at one can
 n ever draw d irect conclusions from one to the other. F o r instance,
 although I would confidently say, as Jung has often said before
 m e, that th e animus is th e m ain problem o f m odern wom an, I
 should hesitate to assert th at th e anim a is the m ain problem o f
m odern m an; in fact, it w ould be com pletely misleading w ere I
to do so. Iw Q u ld ra th e rs a y the a n im u s is the prim ary p ro h lem o f
 every wom an and-the anim a -a se c o n d ^ y — although nevertheless
 a vital-::p rob lem for every.. man,
    This com es from the fact th a t th ere have b een for several
generations a surplus o f w om en (a fact th at I understand has
 already begun to turn into its opposite). N ature probably never
 does anything unnecessarily o r meaninglessly, and this apparent
 loss o f equilibrium has, as is well kno^wn, had the result o f mak-
 ing innum erable w om en leave th e tim e-honored p attern o f being

   T h e standpoint from w hich th e m aterial in this lectu re is
discussed will slightly change planes in th at I shall speak less
exclusively o f the anim us and m ore o f th e whole psychology o f
w om en. N evertheless, th e animus plays such a leading role in the
w riting o f w om en s books that the spotlight is bound to fall upon
him w hen w e com e to w om en authors. H e is indeed such a vital
prob lem for wqm en th at Jung on ce told- m e that the m ost m eri-

As you can im agine, this d ream had anything but a ch eering
effect. I felt then (and still feel today) awfully inadequate to my
pask. And, as so often happens, th e sam e idea was rubbed in inde-
pendently a few weeks later w hen Jung hap pened to say in my
presence that the p art o f the animus that w e could contact and
relate to was the m ere fraction o f a figure that reach ed far, far
beyond w hat we could ever apprehend. My unconscious picked
up th ere on ce m ore and I d ream ed that night o f a m ale figure,
the size o f a m an, in front o f a m u ch larger figure, who in its tu m
had a larg er one behind it, and so ad infinitum, far out o f my
sight and reach.
      Now, o f cou rse, I have long known this fact intellectually. I
have constantly said in m y lectu res that, theoretically, th ere is
no reason why the shadow should not b e m ade en tirely co n ­
scious, for it consists o f p erson al, hum an m aterial th at w e have
rep ressed o r forgotten. T h e re fo re , naturally, one could work on
it in a small square room . In th e shadow problem , the only great
difficulty— apart from th e disagreeable personal aspects— is its
contam ination with th e archetypal figures such as th e anim a
and anim us, but above all w ith the collective shadow, w hich is
popularly called the devil. B y h ard w ork this contam ination can,
for the m ost p art, be cle a re d up. I have often pointed out that
the anim a and anim us a re _ .fig u res_o n .te_h o rd eis.o £ih e_co llec-
tive unconscious, w hich h asjboth, a p a rso n alL an d . a c om pletely

    As you know, exp erien ce justifies one in s p e a in g o f “m y ani­
m us” and “your anim a,” but it is often m uch n earer the m ark to
speak o f “th e” animus and “th e ” anima. W h y then did I have these
d ream s? F o r apparently th ey tell m e things o f w hich I was already
aware, and experience has taught us that this is seldom the case;
a dream tells one som ething one does not know.
   The first dream suggests a totally different approach to the
topic o f the animus than to the topic o f the shadow. T h e lectures

a practically unknown subject, and it needs all our exp erien ce to

   In his Visions sem inar in 1 9 3 1 , Ju n g speaks o f four stages o f
anim a d evelopm ent, describing th eir sym bolic representations
as: E v e (Chaw w a), H elen o f Troy, Mary, and Sophia (an animus
analogy w ould be: Phallus, H usband, H ero , and Psychopom p).2

by th ese four fam ous w om en. A diagram looks som ew hat like

 Jung goes on to say that:


       I have been asked to present the development o f the ani­
       mus in a similar way. You see, all these fragments of old
       philosophy— philosophy was then psychology— have been
        made by men. Chinese philosophy, for instance, which is
        really a sort of psychology, was an entirely masculine inven-
        tion, because women at that time played no role in the world
        o f men, excepting indirectly, by influence. In antiquity and
        in all primitive societies, “c h e r c h e z la fe m m e ” was an eternal
        truth, but [women] were not recognized, and when men
        set to work on psychological matters they overlooked the
        existent of women completely. So no wonder that we have a
        classification of the development of the anima from a deeper
        source— it is more than two thousand years old— and we

  Semitic languages, Chawwa denotes the primordial serpent. The name Eva in the Old
  Testament is thought to have evolved directly from Chawwa. Ed.]

       know practically nothing about the animus, or even about
       the existence of an animus. Men have only cursed women for
       their argumentative ways, but they never thought of making
       a science of it. It was not dignified enough to be made an
       object of science, it was merely the bad moods and irrational
l      ideas of Mrs. Professor, who had nothing to do with the lec-
       ture her husband was giving.
           But one can speculate about the animus and really pro-
       duce a similar scheme for it. H ere again, however, it is a man
       who does it, so I beg your pardon— I mean o f the female
       part of my audience— if I am intruding upon a field which is
       not entirely my own. You are quite free to suggest a different
       classification, so please do consider my point of view only as a
        proposition based upon a certain experience and spiced with
        more or less benevolence.3


      Jung then goes on to explain th at th e Gnostic classification of
th e anim a begins.“at th e b o tto m l.w itk Chawwa, the earth. They
did not m ean th e physical earth anym ore than th e furro}-V in the

4. The Pistis Sophia, dating from approximately 250-300 A.D., relates the Gnostic teach-
ings of the transfigured Jesus to the assembled disciples, also including Mary Magdalene,
Mary the mother of Jesus, and Martha. According to this doctrine, Christ arisen lived eleven
years on earth during which he revealed the complex structures and hierarchies of heaven
familiar in Gnostic teachings. The title Pistis Sophia is obscure, sometimes translated “Faith
Wisdom” or “Wisdom in Faith,” and involves the Gnostic faith in Sophia, who is a consort
and, fi.guratively speaking, a divine syzygy of Christ. She can also be seen as God’s wife,
the so-called theotokos, the mother of God (as in Greek Orthodoxy). Certain Gnostics held
that she was the mother of the spiritual, not corporeal, Jesus, the spiritual Jesus descend-
ing into him when he was baptized by John, being born out of Sophia. See_G.__R.J^Mead,

    supported prim arily by m arried m en (and by the state), then you
    can understand why th e husband parallels H elen, who can be
    seen in those fascinating w om en o f the street. Ju n g then asks:


            Is there any more beautiful love story than the love story of
I           Mary? Wonderfully secret, divine, it is the only love affair of
            God that we know about. He is the illegitimate divine lover
            who produces the Redeemer. So these two stages are abso-
            lutely parallel; the lover always sees .m-theJbeloy.ed_§pmething_

            lover the bringer of the div_:igie message. The Hermes stage
            is the perfect, divine accomplishment, which is again beyond
            human grasp. Now that is my proposition, but I leave it to the
            ladies to invent something better or to argue this proposition.10

           Jung lay down this challenge in 1 9 3 1 , and I feel very strongly
    that not enough has been done about it since. In individual analy-
    sis it has perhaps b een applied by both m en and w om en analysts,
    but I, at al\ events, have h eard little o f oth er people’s results. It
    is, of course, very difficult for a w om an to take up this challenge,
    for Logos is not h e r principle and obviously the discrimination of
    stages is m ainly a m atter o f Logos. She is th erefo re only too likely
    to lose the gam e to h er animus w henever she m ust translate this
    “proposition” into E ro s term s, a subject to which we will return
    later. (As the actual proposition is a p rod u ct o f Logos, we _shall be
    badly in n eed o f th e cooperation and help o f the m en. They will
    b e of the greatest value h ere as they naturally look at the animus
    som ewhat differently, and nothing can be m ore helpful than a
    give and take in these circu m stan ces.)
       Unlike .the anima, j t is very difficult. to find goo.d.m aterial
    in which to see the animus at work. W h en I lectu red on “The
    Animus in L iteratu re” in 1 9 5 7 , I read a great many books by
    w om en with this point in view. I m ust break it to you that the
    harvest in literature has, on the face o f it, been exceedingly disap-
    pointing. Personifications o f th e animus are very rare, particularly

in w om en ’s books. T h e re a re a few, but n ot many, and n ev er one
th at is really first rate. I asked m yself th erefore w here th e animus
was in such a w om an as Jan e A usten? Although h e does n ot por-

w here. In prep arin g and reading th e literatu re for this cou rse, I

 B a ne, w h ic h is th e best anim us stoiy ! know with the exceptíon o f
 W u therin g H tá ^ ts .
    I am often asked why I do not use m en ’s books in describing
 the animus o r w om ens books in describing the anim a. D. H.
  Law ren ce, for instance, gives an apparently p erfect figure o f the
/ animus in som e o f his short stories, 'T h e L ad y Bird” (M rs. Singer)
  being one exam ple, and E m ily B ro n te o f the anima, in W uthering
  H eights (C atherine). How ever, w hen you com e to exam ine the
 m aterial m ore closely, it does not work out, for a m an always
 portrays a masculine psyche and a wom an a feminine one. This
 is probably due to the different ways in which m en and wom en
 w rite. A man writes with his conscious mind; he can hold the line
 o f his plot and his anim a creates the atm osphere o r the feeling
 tone o f the book. W h ereas a wom an usually is quite at hom e in
 the feeling tone and can hold it consciously herself, but the life of
 the book, the plot, is in the hands o f h e r spiritus rector.
         To give a practical example: w hen G oethe was writing The
 Sorrow s o f W erth er as a young m an, he was conscious o f being
 absolutely certain that the plot as he conceived it could only end
 with the suicide o f W erth er; y et w hen h e cam e to write that part,
 h e got into an em otional crisis about it and even w rote in a let-
 te r th at if he had to let W e rth e r die, he would rath er first shoot
 him self.13 G oethe got so em otionally upset that h e b ecam e com -
 pletely identified with W e rth e r and fully possessed by an anima
 m ood. H e describes in a letter how h e carried a pistol about in
 his pocket for th ree days while th e conflict lasted; an d h e writes
 o f the relief it was to him w hen at last h e was able to w rite and
 describe W erth er shooting himself. N ot for one m om ent had
 G oeth e’s conscious mind w avered in th e fact that the only logi-
 cal end o f his plot was suicide, b u t the anim a got him into such
 an em otional tizzy that he lost his feeling judgm ent and even his
 instinct o f self-preservation alm ost completely.

 for you and try to illustrate th em w henever I can from my own
p ractical experience.
    As you know, th e sim plest definition o f the animus as we
experience him in everyday life, th e one th at appears again and
,again in Jung’s books and sem inars, is th e one that describes him
"as the p rod u cer o f opinions in a w om an. (Just as th e anima is the

    Jung describes th e difference m ost poignantly:


       The conscious man and the anima [can be] identical; if a
       man is anima possessed, for instance, he is instantly trans-
       formed into a woman. And so inasmuch as the woman is
       possessed by the animus she becomes naturally a male . . . .
       A man possessed by his emotions is possessed by his anima,
       and when he thinks through his emotions it is ju st as if he
       were a woman; he talks exactly like a woman and will pro-
       duce the same animus stuff. A woman, however, produces
       the animus stuff quite directly . . . . W hen a-woman. has_a_

       which inilmnlly .siiggest.s a certa.in em.oti.on. whi-l€-in_an_aman
       it works the reverse. w ayjfirst he has a mood and then he
       has an opinion. One can see it in this way: if you tell a man
       he is in a bad mood, he says: ‘‘No I am not, decidedly not/’
       And when you say to a woman: “But you have an opinion, a
       prejudice,” she replies: “No, I have n o t’— she has no opin­
       ions, none whatever. But if you say she is in a mood, she will
       admit it. As when one says to a man who is talking out of
       his emotions that he is uttering such and such an opinion,
                     The Anim us Problem in Modern Women                    111



      he cannot help seeing it. A woman cannot help seeing an
      em otion or a mood, because it is quite obvious to h er that
      she has a certain emotion; while to a man it is not obvious
      because he hates to admit that emotion. This is o f course a
      bit complicated but if you have a clear idea o f the relation
      o f the ego to the animus or the anima, you can easily draw
      the conclusion as to the nature o f the masculine or feminine
      figure in a man or woman.15


    Jung has often d escribed how irritating a w om an’s opinions are
to a m an, how they always go beside th e m ark, how they are never
the actual, original, individual thoughts o f that w om an but are
generally collective truths that just make nonsense o f the specific
individual situation and thus destroy hum an con tact. It is as if they
blow from som ew here into th e head o f th e w om an and then take
possession o f her. B u t th e wom an's m ind and h e r animus are not
always so simple to tell apart. Actually, Ju n g points out that, under
certain conditions, th e mind is actually th e animus. It takes only a
slight shift and th e anim us is th en in a w ay h e r mind. This is also
tru e o f th e m an. T h e anim a rules over his function o f relatedness
and E ro s and thus is a p art o f him. W h e n she controls him , and
h e does not con trol her, it b ecom es anim a possession, and then
the anim a is autonom ous and in a sense rules th e situation. W h e n
a p sychological com p lex o r aJ;IBart o f ou rse lv e sb e co m e s autono:
nious, tluni it is_g..uiHn;tlly J’o u iid in so iiie personified form. In fact,
com plexes and any oth er part o f ou r psyches b eco m e personified
in th e m om en t th ey b eco m e dissociated, that is, w hen they take
over for them selves. T he early F re n c h psychologists described
this well. Jung points out that:

       The mind or the human psyche has the peculiarity that every
       part o f it is personal, not in the sense of being like the person
       who has the complex, but a personality in itself. It is as if you
       cut off a little finger and it continues to live quite indepen-
       dently; it would then be a little finger personality, it would be
15. Jung, Nietzsche’s Zarathustra, p. 731.
    112               The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



           a he or she, it would give itself a name and talk out o f its own
           mind. As when one asks children how they know something,
           they might say their little finger told them, as if that were a
           living thing in itself. So certain thoughts that escape from
           control, that dissociate themselves, instantly assume an ego
I         form.16

Jung then beautifully describes the archetypal qualities o f the
anim a and animus:


           ^^^Kly-can_realize_arL archa^pe-withouthav.ingr-hee;aiden±i--
           fied^^^it-fir-st; I f you even touch the animus or anima, the
           most vulgar archetypes o f all, you are they, and you cannot
           realize them without having been thoroughly caught by
           them. Nowoman will realize w hatthe animusis withouthafc
           ing been identical with him, and no man will realize what _the
           anima is without having been filled by the anima, In speaking
           of such things, I say: “as if.” It is as if these archetypes were
i         each of them stronger than the ego. They easily catch hold
           of you and you are possessed as if they were lions or bears,
           say— primitive forces which are quite definitely stronger than
           you. You see, our prejudice is that we are sitting on top of the
           mountain with our conscious and our will, and nothing can
           get at us; and then the unconscious catches us from below.
           People call the thing that is below “the subconscious” instead
           o f “the unconscious"; it sounds so much better. The subcon­
           scious is the cellar, something below your feet, and you are
           St. George standing upon the dragon. But if you descend into
           that world, you encounter a figure which is definitely stron­
           ger that your ego complex. Therefore, quite naively, Rider
           Haggard speaks o f “She-that-must-be-obeyed.” Nothing
           doing otherwise, you have to obey It is quite self-evident that
           she is the stronger part . . . . Sometimes the dragon is over-
           come, so we can assume that itis not always so strong. But
           there are plenty of whale-dragons that attack and overcome
    16. Jung, Visions, p. 1216f
                     The Anim us Problem in Modern Women



      the hero, proving that the dragon is much the stronger— until
      the hero makes the attack from within.17


   J ung c ontinues this discussion several pages later, saying that

p lace destructively.
    T h e re is another story in one o f Jung’s sem inars w hich shows
th e background o f this phenom enon very well:


      A happy couple make up their mind to go to the theater the
      next day to see an interesting play. It is Monday when they
      discuss the plan and they are looking forward to it with great
      pleasure. Then Tuesday the wife has forgotten to tell the
      girl to clean a certain pair o f boots for her husband; and that
      pair o f boots is important because he has a sort o f vanity and
      thinks he looks particularly smart in them, so they are a bit

17. Jung, Nietzsches Zarathustra, pp. 155f.
18. Ibid., pp. 22lf.
114           The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



      taboo, and only on certain days ought he to wear them. The
      theater in the evening is such an occasion, therefore those
      boots should be cleaned, the wife has promised her husband
      to have them done, and it should not be forgotten. The girl
      always forgets them, because she dimly feels they are taboo.
      I f she is so immoral as to allow herself to be consciously in
      love with her master, she will clean those boots everyday and
      put them before his door; but if she is a bit moral she always
      forgets them, and then it is the duty o f his wife to remind her
      o f them. But on account of that very secret complication, the
      wife is also quite inclined to forget them, and through that
      systematic forgetting she arouses the wrath o f her husband.
      He comes out of his room and looks for his shoes and there
      are the wrong pair. Then he says: “But didn’t I tell you?” And
      she says: “I thought you wanted th e s e boots, you always pre-
      fer them when you go to the theater.” Now that is not true
      at all and she never has thought it, but in that moment the
      devil catches hold o f her because she has forgotten some­
      thing, and then [the animus] thinks. And she says it with a
      tone of absolute conviction, perhaps she is even offended by
      the foolish idea of her husband that on such days he should
      wear his taboo shoes, that he suddenly declares now that
      he wants them. So with aplomb she assures him that he has
      often told her that he wanted to wear the other boots on the
      day when he is proceeding to any important action. Then
      there is trouble, she has forgotten, she has omitted some­
      thing, and that omission is sufficient to tum her mind into
      an autonomous function so that instantly the animus comes
      up and saying: “I thought.” W henever a woman begins like
      that you know she has not thought, just not, and that is most
      irritating to a man’s mind because he feels that she was
      thoughtless about a most important matter. Unfortunately
      it hits him on a sore spot, the fatal spot being that the shoes
      are taboo. He has a sort of complex to look smart on such a
      day, he knows it is ridiculous but his anima persuades him
      that he looks so smart in those shoes, she says: D on’t you

      rem em ber when you saw them in the shop window you said:
      “I f I were standing in those shoes I would look marvelous?”
      and so you bought them .” That is the kind of thing that the
      anima does. So the anima character o f that particular object
      upsets his wife and calls forth the animus in her, and she is
      quite likely to becom e dissociated whenever the shoes turn
      up. You see things are as secret as that, it is a secret game
      going on all the time.

      It might be a certain chair, a table, a bottle o f W ne, a pic-
      ture, and it sounds perfectly absurd, but if you go carefully
      into the story, you find that those are all symbolic objects,
      objects of secret animus or anima cults; and since animus
      and anima were originally deities, everything belonging to
      them is exceedingly important. One should always go into the
      secret history o f such cases in order to find out the value of
      apparently quite unimportant little things, for they have some
      secret value and powerful m a g c effects. You see itn eed s very

       woman just has to wait until they have snapped back into the
       right place.19

     H erein lies th e real trouble, and this is just w hat w e always
forget. T h e a n im a an d .a n im u s -we:re-©rigmaUy-deitie.s, and as
Ju n g notes:

       It is owing to [their] divine qualities that women are so
       completely under the spell o f the animus, utterly helpless
       victims of his power, and o f course the more they identify
       with him, the more they are done for. The same thing is true
       o f the anima. They are gods in the antique sense o f the word.
       Spjteler calls the anima a goddess; she j s really. a_..queen,
       her power is indubitable-and~overwhelming,.Andwhenthe.
       animus appears in his divine form, he .has ju s t that- quality,
       he is the. stuff out of whieh.the.-gQds ,$ e r e ,made. As people
       advance in consciousness and understanding, they discover
       more and more what an extraordinary power the animus
       represents. It is a miracle if a woman can escape it. It is like
       the power of a neurosis, a phobia, or a compulsion. You think
       such a symptom is morbid and should not be, you despise
       it and think it is ridiculous, yet what seems so ridiculously
       small and unimportant is perhaps the more important thing
       in your life. It hinders you in every moment, it spoils your life,
       yet you go on saying it is nothing but a neurosis, a perfectly
       ridiculous symptom. It is as if you regarded [World War I] as
       a great mistake on the part of certain people . . . . But that
       is the neurosis, and you make the tremendous mistake of
       not realizing that what is apparently so insignificant is really
       a great power. And so it is with the animus and the anima.
       They are divine as the ancient deities were divine, having the
       quality of being beyond good and evil. They can never be
       envisaged from any moral point of view.20

    If looked at from this angle, the history o f religion is very
enlightening. O ne can study the entanglem ents o f the gods and
learn a lot of useful things in daily life. T h ere are num erous

a voice said to him: “T h at is art.” H e w ondered if the unconscious
was form ing another personality in him w hich was insisting on
expression, for, w ithout knowing exactly why, h e was sure this
voice was feminine. A living w om an m ight have said it in just the
sam e way because she would be uninterested in the discrim ina-
/io n th at she was tram pling under foot. Obviously it was not sci­
 e n ce, so it must be art, as if those w ere the only alternatives in
th e world. Jung says: “T h at is the w ay a w om an’s mind works.”23
T h e argum ent continued, Jung was certain she was wrong, but
she w ent on insisting it was art.
   This was Jung’s first experien ce o f the cunning insinuations
w hich the anima can press on a m an, giving things a false slant
and tem pting him away from reality. I f he had believed h e r and
thought he was a m isunderstood artist, he would have b een in
h e r pocket and w henever she liked she could then have brought
in the reverse: “D o you really im agine th at this nonsense is art?”
T h at is the way one can be ground to pieces by both anima and
animus in the dram a o f enantiodrom ia phenom ena. B ecau se Jung
stood his ground, refused ^ e r suggestion, and yet granted h er
reality and the right to speak and defend h e r point o f view, he was
able to build a piece o f ground w here they could m eet satisfacto-
rily and discuss the m atter.
   Now, o f course, a very similar technique can also be em ployed
with th e animus, but it is rath e r dangerous for w om en to im itate
it too closely. W h ereas a m an is working with his own conscious
principle, Logos, w hich can discrim inate— for instance, w hen
h e tells his anim a it is ju st not art— w e have to avoid the d irect
parallel im itation in a w om an, for she would be working with the
principle and in th e m edium o f the animus and it is certain that
h e will be able to b eat h e r at that gam e, for it is a field w here he
is m ore at hom e than she.
    In his Zarathustra seminar, Jung deals with the subject o f the
vase that one requires so th at one can give a form to th e contents
o f th e unconscious. In speaking o f the problem o f sentim entality
o f m en, he says:
23. Ibid., pp. 185f.
                     The A nim us Problem in M odern Women              1.1.9



      sentimentality gets on one’s nerves and rightly so; one should
      be shocked by sentimentality because it is so wrong. It is
      quite correct when women are shocked by the anima sen­
      timentality o f men, for it is just the wrong expression. But
      that is simply unfortunate; it comes just from the fact that
      there are unconscious mental contents for which there are
      no conscious forms. They can be couched- in other terms
      than sentiment. A man is possessed by the anima on account
      o f the fact that his mind does not offer an opportunity to
      his unconscious. He has no vessel, no form, into which he
      receives its contents. The anima is pregnant and he is merely
      sentimental about it. He is like old Joseph who is a' somewhat
      regrettable figure; he looks at Mary and says, "Oh yes, it is
      very wonderful that you are pregnant by the Holy Ghost;
       yes, I will be a patron saint to you. I will help you. I will
       go with you to Egypt.” But it is a regrettable situation, very
       awkward; he gets awfully sentimental about it. And that is
       exactly a man's situation whose mind does not provide that
       form, that hermetic vase, in which to receive the contents of
       his unconscious. In that way, by understanding it, you might
       becom e perhaps quite tolerant and lenient with a mans
       sentimentality. But he really deserves a spanking neverthe-
       less, and women with instinct will never hesitate to provide
       it; they cannot help punishing a man for this kind of unreal
       sentimentality. For a man ought to take his mind seriously
       and to provide the necessary vase in which to receive those
       contents o f his unconscious.24

    It was about 1 9 1 6 w hen Jung realized th at the unconscious
was form ing a personality th at was n ot him self and was behaving
like a w om an. W h en he treated h e r as he m ight have done a real
w om an and e n te re d into discussion with her, his mind offered a
h erm etic vessel to th e unconscious, w hich suited it and led to the
discovery not only o f the anim a b u t o f the collective unconscious
and th e archetypal world behind her.
24. Jung, Nietzsche’s Zarathustra, p. 738f.
12 0                  The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Wor^ n



       In Zarathustra, Jung continues:

        It is the same with women; it is of course not expressed there
        in terms of pregnancy, but in masculine terms. It is the log os
        spe-^naticos that plays the same role in a women, the seed
        word. Her playful mind is not sentimental— well, you know
        what an animus is, I don’t need to repeat it. It is irritating to
        a man and he is rightly irritated and is quite right in beating
        back . . . .    brutality is always aroused by the, animus
        of a women, but she needs and wants it, her unço:—cãpus

        that it is not animus; if it is animus he beats it back and he is
        quite right to do so. As a woman is quite right in refusing that
        slimy sticky sentimentality a man produces. But that wrong-
        ness is pregnant, as the animus is full o f seed.25


       H e re we com e to a real cru x for w om en who are trying to
work on the animus and on th e unconscious. W e cannot just
copy Jung’s o r man’s way o f dealing with it, and yet the vessel
we know o f is m ade by th e Logos, and to som e extent it is m ore
o r less inevitable th at we use it. I doubt, for instance, if it would
even be possible for a wom an to have discovered the existence of
the animus in h erself in the way Jung discovered the existence of
the anim a in himself. T h e.an im u s is origmaUy_enfue^.ide.n.üeaL

    Personally, I am convinced that we would have never discov-
ered the anim us for ourselves. Anyone with experience in this
field will agree th at it well fits th e in n er facts. H ow ever, it is still
a borrow ed Logos con cep t, so clearly it cannot be fully adequate
for a w om an’s needs and is not yet th e right form as alluded to
in the above passage from the Z a rathu stra seminar. _A jw o m a n },^ ”'

       Obviously it w ould be very difficult to describe such a form ,
b ecau se expression by w ord is Logos and thought, so th at one is
trying to d escribe E ro s in term s o f its exact opposite, and that is
an impossible task. I can only give you a hint o r two from m y own
experien ce (m yself and o th e r w om en ) and leave you to decide
w h eth er th ese agree with or con trad ict your own experience.
    Although I recognized that th e co n ce p t o f the animus really
fit the facts, I m ust-adm it th at I w asted a lot o f tim e, years in
fact, trying to ch ase him intellectually. O f cou rse, he was always
too clever for m e and fooled m e again and again. At last I real-
ized that th ere was a certain eros reaction— how can I describe
it?— perhaps a feeling o f frustration, o f unreality, o f not having my
feet on th e earth , o f being out o f relation with my surroundings.
W h en ev er the anim us spoke o r thought, I then had a feeling o f it
not being m y "ow n” voice or thinking. I learned to recognize this
condition and slowly to know it beyond any doubt, and then for
the first tim e I had the beginning o f a form with w hich I could
approach the unconscious.
   To p u t it in oth er words: if the animus had told m e, as in Jung’s
case, that w hat I was doing was “art” (m ore likely he would have
called it scien ce), I might have begun to argue with him on a Logos
basis, b u t very soon he would have su cceeded in inserting some
irrelevant opinions into me which would have hidden the real
issue at point. (This is the same bewildering mixture o f archetypal
and hum an elem ents referred to above.) B u t i£ l.h a d b e e n a b le to
realize how it struck m e in relatio n to itselfjm d m y enyironm ent, I
 122             The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



would have kno-^ beyond doubt th a t the suggestion jh d n Q tclick ,
that I could.not relate. to it. Then I would have had firm ground
under my feet in a place w here the animus could not confuse m e,
for E ros is not his principle. O f course, he constantly swallows
 impulses o f relatedness that one is not too sure about, but that is
,b ecau se one does not stand by them .
     In the case of a w ell-tried E ro s experience, like th e one I
 spoke of, I gradually learned to know w hen the animus was inter-
 fering. W hen Q n ejdeals.w ith-hi- through Exosjelatedness,_dhe!!
he can do.very m uch less, and w hats m ore, one. gr.ad!J.ally.lga:r:w,s

It seem s to be actually m ore satisfactory to him when he cannot
put us in his pocket but rather w hen w e can behave like w om en,
w hen w e can m eet his Logos with our E ro s. W hen it works the
oth er way, that is, th e wrong way, then w e end up with a statem ent
like Gill M artins in H ogg’s Confessions o f a Justified S in n er w here

      very unsavory undertaking. Yet every man is working with the

       unaware of the fact that he can fall in love with a woman. He
       thinks that falling in love is a kind of illness which happens
       in early youth and which one combats by marrying. As a man
       said to me: “Just in order to get through with the damned
       thing." That is Logos.
           One could say that both principles play a tremendous role
       in the history of the thought of redemption, which is really a
124              The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Tnith in Women



        psychological affair. For instance, in Christianity it is not only
        Logos that plays the role o f redeemer, it is also Eros in the
        form o f the principle o f love. There again one sees the incor-
        poration of the two principles. I m a add here that-the-ideal

        And Eros withoutthe Logos inside never understands, there
        is nothing but blind relatedness. Such people can be related
        to God knows what— like certain women who are dissolved
        completely in little happy families— cousins, relations— and

th at is, in late R om an and G reek syn cretism , th e god E ro s was

       committed the most atrocious offence against good taste and
       morality, through a sacred [animus] conviction that it was
       wholesome and reasonable— like mothers who torture their
       children because they think that is what ought to be done.
       It is appalling what the animus can do. I f such an animus-
       ridden woman gets it into her head that to go without clothes
       is wholesome and decent, then she just goes about naked and
       is not in the least disturbed by it, disregarding the fact com­
       pletely that she is not beautiful, that she is an old hag. That
       woman had three sons and she walked about the house before
       them, and then marveled that they went wrong and had sex
       fantasies. And that was a well-meaning woman who always
       tried to be hygienic, to eat the right kind of salad, and all that
       stuff. She was liberal and full of the ideas o f social service, she
       helped along everything under the sun that was of public use.
       And to wear no clothes was much cheaper and so wonder-
       fully clean, and why should the body be ugly? . . . Mind you,
       she was an Englishwoman, not even a German; I could have
       forgiven her if she had been German. That is what the animus
       can do, cruel nonsense. So a woman can prostitute herself if it
       suits the animus, not to suit herself, but to do the right thing
       or the usual thing, never considering her own instincts.28


    B ecau se o f the confusion that is so o ften visible in ordinary
speech b etw een m an and anim a and b etw een w om an and animus,
it som etim es seem s well nigh hopeless for a w om an to stick to h e r
E ro s and a m an to stick to his Logos w h en they are dealing with
each other. F o r exam ple, in the face o f th e m an ’s irrational em o-
tionality, the w om an m ust distance h e rse lf from animus rem arks,
digs, and jibes. A nd in the face o f th e w om an's irrational “facts”
and shots below the belt, the m an m u st distance him self from his
em otionality and moods and rem ain sensible. At least I know I
have often b een n ear to despair in this resp ect.
   O n ce, in speaking o f m an and w om an’s difficulty in under-
standing each other, Jung said:
28. Jung, Visions, pp. 316f.
1.26              The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



        The difficulty o f understanding does not lie where people
        who have no experience assume. It is rather the difficulty o f
        understanding oneself. I f a man could only understand the
        difference between him self and his anima, he would under­
        stand himself; then he would know what a man is, and then
/       he would know by instinct what a woman is. I f he thinks
        via the anima about himself, he never will discover him self
        but stay caught in illusions. And inasmuch as a woman does
        not know herself—and if she thinks through her animus
        she certainly does not know h erself— she will never know
        a man, she will be forever bewildered. N atu rally , she will
        project her opinion upon a man, he ought to be this and
        that. So the real difficulty is not in the object, where such
        blindfolded people always suppose the darkness to be.
        A man thinks the difficulty is that he doesn’t understand
        the woman; no, he doesn’t understand himself. W henever
        one has to treat such a condition, the whole course o f the
        analysis, as dictated by dreams, always leads the patient
        to himself; and if they can once understand something of
        themselves, they understand other people. One cannot
        learn it through the object because one invariably sees only
        one’s own face in the object; one stares into the cloud and it
        becomes a mirror. It is finally one’s own face. It is a general
        truth that one only understands anything in as much as one
        understands oneself.29


       T he problem o f being forever bew ildered about the oth er sex,
which can only end when one knows oneself, is particularly evi-
dent to m e at least in this m atter o f the E ro s and Logos principles.
I f one’s relatedness can pass th e test o f on e’s own animus, who is
th e m aster in the art of destroying it, w e can be p retty sure that it
will also prove reliable with m en in th e outside w orld. B u t if the
animus can d estroy it, it is a sign that w e still know ourselves too
little and that w e shall see ou r own face in the ob ject instead o f
the object as it really is itself.
29. Jung, Nietzsche’s Zarathustra, p. 742.
                  The Anim us Problem in M odern Women



   T h e p oint I w ant to m ake is that, as far as m y exp erien ce goes,
this looking for th e trou b le in on eself very m uch includes looking
for o n e ’s own principle; in th e case o f a w om an, for E ro s. In my
own exp erien ce, observed both in o th er w om en and myself, w hen
one only tries to be related and fem inine outside, for instance,
with a m em b er o f th e opposite sex, on e is especially exposed to
anim us opinions. H e whispers: “N ow you should show feeling,”
“N ow b e en tirely passive,” and th en quick as lightning, h e whis­
p ers, “C o m e, co m e , you are not fem inine at all.” O r: “H ow could
you say this o r th a t?” . . . and already th e w hole situation has
landed in th e devils kitchen. All spontaneity and naturalness is
exclu d ed . B u t if on e tries it out inside, if one finds out th e places
w h ere one can stand by o n es feeling o f relatedness against on es
animus, th en you g et to know w here one is safe from him , and you
find a p iece o f ground w here h e also can n ot attack and destroy
one’s outside relationship.
    I do n ot m ean th at th e m atter can possibly b e settled entirely
inside. In pointing out N ietzsch es problem , Jung says in th e sam e
sem inar that:


      you cannot really get into a serious conflict with yourself
      when you are [vacationing in the Alps] with nothing around
      but an elderly landlady. Only when the contrast becomes
      personified do things get hot; a_reaL fire_can_. never burst
      forth withouL a_p..exrsQnified_o....Qp.posite. The .other_side ..must.
      ajso haye.. body,- and-because-it cannot haave-your.. o:wn,..it will
      take som ebodyelse s. I f your opposite appears simply as your
      inner enemy, it is perfectly abstract because it has no body
      . . . . And then you may think it is merely your imagination; or
      you may admit that you have very bad qualities and confess
      all your sins with much sentiment before God, but if any-
      body also should tell you that you had such sins you would
      swear hell and the devil against it. You would not accept it,
      particularly not if that person had a hand in your system. So
      a conflict only becom es real when the other side is projected
      into somebody. Then it fills a body, then your own opposite is
 128                  The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



        projected into somebody who is perhaps forced to play a role
        in opposition to you.30


    T h ere is no incentive to have it out with the animus unless
 there is fire enough in on e’s relationship to som eone o f the other

 Jung speaks o f “suffering a su ccess” and points out that success is
 really harder to stand than failure. W h en a relationship is going
 specially well, for exam ple, then w hat a chance for the animus to
 whisper “. . . it must always be like this now” or to insinuate that
 one happy hour is just the prom ise o f another, thus delivering the
 wom an over into the full pow er o f the concupiscentia. W e will
 return to this problem later.
       It is clear that it is necessary while working on on eself to real­
 ize clearly that th ere is an ou ter and an inner world and to distin-
 guish betw een the two, a task, w hich on accou n t o f projection, is
 by no means easy. In the Visions seminar, Jung says:


         For practical uses, it is really best— though terribly shocking,
         I admit— to assume that everything has a double existence:
        a known tangible surface and at the same time an invisible,
        unknown existence. And you can call the unconscious and
        unknown side of a thing its soul, as the unconscious invis­
        ible life in us is called soul or essence or whatever term you
        like to use— an old-fashioned idea, as old as the world, and
        therefore shocking for the modern man. We are the people
        who think they have discovered the right picture of the world

     after all these centuries, so it looks as if we were making a
     most awful regression in fetching that old image of a double
     world from the depths of history. But I assure you it is most
     practical to do so; otherwise you will never understand the
     meaning of the animus and the anima. The best thing is .. ,t o r '
     assume that we are standingl!!_n between two w orld j a visible

ened th is i d ^ i n a very enlightening way. In his Visions seminar,
he says:

       the country o f lh e animus . . . would be the collective uncon­
       scious, for the animus is normally a function; <m.eeQ:^uld_caLLit
       the semiconscious fringe ofTthe woman’s]m ind ^ w h ic h she
       pgrcer^-the-eo-nective-unconscious . . .
          Yes, the animus would carry the transcendent function, it
       would be a sort of p sy ch o p om p os, because the animus and the
       mind of a woman are those functions in which the data of the
       unconscious and of the conscious can be united. Therefore
31. Jung, Visions, p. 206.
130               The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



       the Logos element would carry the transcendent function
       in a woman, as the Eros would function in a man. His Eros,
       his personal relatedness, together with the animus, carry the
       symbol which unties the data of the unconscious and the
       conscious, and thus makes the transcendent function possible.


           The function of the animus, like that of the anima . . . [is
       that of a] bridge; so he is on the side of the collective uncon­
       scious and not on the side of the obvious so-called material
       world. But there is always a certain danger that the animus
       falls backward, so to speak, disappears into the collective
       unconscious, and then for a while the connection with the
       unconscious would be cut off. It is like a draw-bridge, which
       has its moorings in the unconscious; when it is dra^rc up, the
       gate to the unconscious is shut. That would be about the right
       image of the animus, because it really belongs more to the
       unconscious than to the conscious. You see, the animus is not
       created by conscious, it is a creation o f the unconscious, and
       therefore it is a personification of the unconscious. It is & e
       gate to the collective unconscious, and by a certain attitude
       one can provoke that function to appear; but if it returns to
       itself, pulls up the bridge, that locks the gate . . . . The anima
       and animus have not been just invented by the conscious;
       they have been fo u n d by the conscious. It is nothing that we
       have done in the conscious in order to build a bridge to the
       unconscious; it is rather that the collective unconscious came
       to us in the form of an anima or an animus; and, of course,
       when we became aware o f it, we reached out for that figure
       and thus established the relationship.32

appeared in my second dream . This point is not ably dealt with
in E m m a Jung’s excellent p ap er on th e animus, although I wish
to refer you to this essay so th at you can see th e w om an’s point o f
view in this m ost practical but extrem ely vital p rob lem .33
    W e find perhaps th e m ost illuminating o f all the things Jung
has said about th e animus in his Visions seminar, and in particular
in his co m m en t about th e figure o f th e w om an w hen she found
a rough black stone in a fish that had cast itself at h e r feet. She
rubbed th e stone against h e r breast— that is, gave it libido— and
it tu rn ed to am ber. T h en she says:

     Within the amber I saw a face of suffering . . . Then I felt
     the amber beating with a strong pulse, and I felt tired and
     lay do^n on the ground. There it beat like a great heart and
     soon the ground and the trees about me beat also. I began to
     feel the pulsation eve^rywhere.34


She felt th e necessity o f freeing th e face from the am ber. At last
she realized this could only b e done b y giving h e r blood to it, so
she cu t h er breast, and w hen she did this the am ber vanished and
a m an bound with thongs and p ierced with arrows stood in the
jew el’s p la ce.35 This man is naturally th e animus, and this explains
the suffering: first his face is suffering and then hers as she cuts
h erself to give the m an h er blood. H e re she has had to fe tte r h er
masculinity. This is w here Jung says th at th e real form o f the ani­
mus is a hero with som ething divine, b u t we always have to deal
with an opinionating substitute. Jung continues:


      For this woman was beset with many animus devils, they
      were all over the place, and then through the whole proce-
      dure of these visions, the process o f transformation, her mind
      . . . became imprisoned in the earth, in the up-coming Yin

       material, in the female, the mother, and slowly her animus
       was suppressed. She no longer had opinions about things as
       she assumed they should be, but gave the material a chance
       to speak its own mind. So things began to happen to her,
       thoughts came to her, and she stopped having opinions about
       things which ou g h t to come to her, not seeing what actually
       was happening. That unreal negative animus prevents the
       accurate perception o f psychological facts, always putting
       an opinion in the place of the actual perception. As soon as
       a woman perceives a thing, the animus steps in and says it is
        something quite different, and thus the actual experience is
        secretly falsified. Instead o f a real experience a mere empty
        opinion is substituted about what it ought to be, or what it
        possibly might be. Now she has learned to experience objec-
        tively, to see the things which really happen, and that has
       imprisoned her animus.36


      You see these qualities in the o u te r world and in o u r ou ter
personal lives as well as w hen we try to understand ou r dreams
o r do active imagination. This is w here this unreal opinionating
substitute is all over the place, preventing us from experiencing
psychic reality exactly as “h e ” (the animus) fills us with illusions
about ou ter reality. T h is passage b y .Jung,.si;e..ms_.j;u...me..Xí£»para-

The tendency to distort reality on the part o f both animus and
anima is perhaps the m ost com m on reason why people have such
difficulty with active imagination. T h ey have not yet su cceed ed
in im prisoning their animus, he is still all over the place, and he
succeeds in distorting any d irect experience o f the inner world
until it seem s too silly to be taken seriously at all. As to not seeing
reality, one sees this problem in M oyzisch’s “O peration C ice ro .”37

       ence between the objective situation and his mood, when he
       no longer allows his mood to blindfold his mind, when he can
       set it apart, acknowledge that he has a peculiar mood, that
       is the beginning of the imprisonment of the anima. After a
       while he will be able to say to his mood: “You have no right
       to exist, I will put you into a test tube and you shall be ana-
       lyzed.” Of course this means a great sacrifice, it can only be
       done with blood,-it requires a superhuman effort to bottle up
       the anima. So I quite Jrecognize what an extraordinary accom-
       plishment it is for a woman to put the animus aside, to say, “I
       will put you into a test tube for later analysis.”38

    anim a may be th at as the anim a was pushed out o f h er world
    by h er seeing reality as it is, she fell into a sticky mass like resin
    w hich gradually h ardened and im prisoned her, and she ends up
    cap tu red in the “u p -com in g Yin m aterial” as Ju n g expresses it in
    th e seminar.
/       T h ere is som ething of the sam e idea in the old G nostic legend
    o f Nous and Physis: when Nous was adm iring his reflection in the
    w ater on earth , Physis (a personification o f nature) caught him
    in such a strong em b race that she drew him right into the earth
    w here he has b een im prisoned ever since. As you know, it is his
    liberation that is the main co n cern o f the alchem ists.
       As far as I can see, the only way w e can effectively put the ani­
    m us in a “test tube” is by following the principle o f life as it flows
    and changes— always curbing any opinions about it. I learned this
    practically by the way that my anim us was always trying to pass
    judgm ents on such things as im portant conversations, contact
    with people who m atter to m e, and so on. I learned to say to him:
    “You shut up and stay shut up. Only tim e will show w hether it
    was right o r w rong. I will discuss it w ith you later, but go away
    now. W e don’t know yet how it will tu m o u t.” It w orked for m e;
    it stopped the anim us, and th en I could ju d ge by resu lts, by real­
    ity, by the flow o f life itself, and in as far as I could do this, the
    animus got stuck as it w ere in the resin o f life. In this w om ans
    vision the resin seem s to symbolize th e feminine equivalent of
    th e form m ade by m an’s Logos. B u t a discussion then and there
    with the animus is seldom if ever successful, for if he is free and
    all over the place, he can kill life with his opinions just as a bullet,
    an arrow, or a spear can kill any living creatu re.
          W e still have to ask ourselves: ‘W h y was it am b er in this
    vision?” A m ber is the fossilized resin, that is, the crystallized
    sap o r lifeblood primarily o f pine trees. It com es from the old
    forests that b ecam e subm erged in the sea. Although it hardens
    completely, you can m elt it down with hot oil so that it becom es
    quite tacky. It also has m agnetic -features. W hen hardened, this
    resin results in a ^ p e o f gem stone that arises not from minerals

but o u t o f the essence o f the tree, o f vegetable life. 39 So the quick,
spearlike, unreal opinions o f the animus, w hich always shoot
beside the mark, are slowed down by th e sticky substance o f the
essen ce o f nature. They are thus forced to m elt and mingle with
the resin, with the essence o f vegetative life, and an irrelevant or
even destructive opinion about life is rep laced by an experience
o f life w hich in tu m leads to a type o f spiritual understanding. As
M arie-Louis von F ran z expressed it w hen we w ere discussing this
subject, the resin, the gum arabic, turns into Gnosis, into spiritu-
ally exp erien ced life and thus the opposition betw een spirit and
instinct is gradually united.
   In alchem y, it is M aria Prophetissa, the legendary wom an
alchem ist, who emphasizes the im portance o f gum in the process,
and as a w om an she points in a similar direction. H e r maxim,
“M arry gum with gum in tru e m arriage,” is repeatedly quoted by
the later alchem ists. In Psychology a n d A lchem y, Jung com m ents
th at “originally it was gum arabic, and it was used here as a secret
nam e for the transform ing substance.”40 T h e gum , in particular,
is th e ingredient for fixing the elusive M ercurius. Jung quotes a
Latin p oem in Psychology a n d A lch em y w ritten by a com m enta-
to r on M aria Prophetissa w hich translates as:


        Maria utters b rief wanders because
             such are the things that she thunders.
        She fixes what runs to the bottom with
               double strong gums . . .

39. [Amber is made from the resin, for instance, of the now-extinct pinus succinifera and
many other trees throughout the world. Sources of amber are found not only in India and
China, but in Poland, England, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic. Its age varies from
about 20 to 60 million years old, it appears in a variety of colors from honey yellow to red-
yellows, and as opposed to mineral gems, is surprisingly light and warm to the touch. It is
easily formed into jewelry and can be burned as incense with the aroma of pine wood. In
some places along the coast of the southeastern Baltic region, amber washes up onto the
beach in almost limitless quantities, coming from the resins of ancient trees lying beneath
the sea. Amber readily produces static electricity when rubbed; a feature particularly fas-
cinating to earlier cultures. It was called electron in ancient Greek, from which the words
electron and electricity are derived. Ed.]

 H erm es, the two being practically synonymous. H erm es, rem em -
 ber, is set at the highest stage in Jung’s four levels o f developm ent.
 Although p resen t from the beginning, M ercurius is initially the
 negative asp ect o f H erm es, who, as you know, was a great stealer
 o f cattle and altogether a dubious ch aracter. T h e elusive and fugi-
 tive animus loves to make sweeping statem ents that miss reality,
 that rush past it in a m addening way. B ut here M aria glues him
 to the bottom o f reality in the resins w here he can no longer rush
 past anything but m ust stay put and transform — w h eth er he likes
 it or not. It is the same idea again as that o f Nous caught in the

    I would like to give an exam ple o f how it works out practically.
 A woman living below h er possibilities w ent to see a male analyst.
 She was m uch im pressed by him, felt really understood and felt he
 was an honest, decent man. However, like lightning, there cam e
 the animus. She thought: “I am a m arried woman. I m ay fall in
 love with him.” So she decided against analysis and rem ained stuck
 w here she was. If she had not let herself be possessed by that idea,
 41. Ibid., par. 209, n81.
                      The Anim us Problem in M odern Women



if she had thought about it, she would have seen that she suspected
the analyst o f wanting to seduce h er and could have seen the
absurdity o f h e r suspicion. T he animus in this case had put a gener-
ally recognized truth that m en and w om en should not have affairs
into a totally different individual situation. If she could have stood
up to h er original feeling that the analyst was a d ecen t m an and
said: “N ow you just wait, w e’ll see what this m an really is or isn't,”
then she could have had the chance to p u t th e animus in th e resin
until th e analysis showed what was behind it. JungjpQ m tSjautthat:


       putting. th e.thing into. a_test tube.,_or into a. cauldron, is. the.
       be^nning_ofthe. alchemistic procedure; the imprisonment of
       the animus or of the anima is for the purpose of transformation.
       This is a real process of sublimation. There is no sublimation of
       sex, that is imagination. This is a transformation, not of sex, but
       of forms, of experiences. Through imprisonment, the animus
       becomes peculiarly changed, he is stripped of his world, for
       when a thing is in a test tube . . . externai influences are exclud-
       ed and the thing [remains] undisturbed inside. And so it does
       not disturb one’s surroundings; in that way the most dangerous
       microbes can be kept in one’s room without infection, because
       nothing can get into the test tube and nothing can get out. So
       when the animus cannot get out into the external atmosphere,
       he has no object and then he has time to transform.
            [T]he main point in this transformation is that one takes
       objects away from those animus or anima devils. They only
       have objects if you allow yourself to indulge in something.
       Concupiscentia is the term for that in the church, you find
       it chiefly in St. Augustine; or convoitise in French; or desir-
       ousness in English; or Begehrlichkeit in German. That is
       the point at which all the great religions come together. In
       Buddhism it is the fire of desirousness that must be com-
       bated, and it is the same in Brahmanism, in the Tantric phi-
       losophy, in Manichaeism, in Christianity, and it is a term in
       psychology [as well].42
42. Jung, Visions, pp. 613f.
  138                  The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Wo-men



     Obviously if desirousness is the m eetin g point o f all the great
 religions, we can be sure it com es close to being the v ery crux in
 hum an nature. This is probably the m ost difficult em otion of all
 to forego. T he answ er o f the Christian C hurch— renunciation—
  though an absolutely necessary stage in hum an developm ent, has
/ in the long run proved to be too one-sided. T h e rep ressed oth er
  side has broken all bounds in o u r day and confronts us with the
  task o f finding another answer. Jung continues:


         When you indulge in desirousness, whether your desire is
         towards heaven or towards hell, you give the animus or anima
         an object; then they are extraverted into the world, they are
         not within, so the thing that ought to be of the night is o f the
         day, and the thing that should be under your feet is on top
         of you. But when you can say: Yes, I desire it, yet I do not
         indulge in it; I'll make up my mind to have it, I will try to get
         it, or if I make up my mind to renounce it, I shall renounce
         it; if your conscious attitude is such, then there is no chance
         for the animus or for the anima. But if you are drawn by your
         own desires, naturally you are possessed.43


        Although th e whole realm o f th e concupiscentia is red hot,
 increasing the difficulty o f the task a hundredfold, the attitude
 that will be effective tow ard it does not differ essentially from
 the one we have ju st considered tow ard the animus or for animus
 opinions in general. T h e only w ay that I know o f keeping desire
 in hand is confronting it with reality. I f you make up you r mind to
 try to g et w hatever it is you want (the first o f Jung's alternatives),
 you m ust face the position as it is, take every disagreeable con-
 sequence and the full responsibility fo r standing up for w hat one
 desires. This is very disagreeable, especially for w om en, for pride
 has to be thrown out along with m any vain illusions. (Naturally, it
 is similar for m en with the anima.) Or, if you make up your mind
 to renounce it, th ere can be no sour grapes. O ne m ust take the

   A young d o c to rw h o had ju st begun his ca re e r as an analyst
told m e o f his difficulties with a case o f a fifty-year-old w om an
as he was w orried th e case was going w rong. T he dream s soon
revealed a pow erful sex tran sferen ce in th e w om an. I asked him
how he exp erien ced th e whole thing. H e said he had read our
sem inar on th e anim us, and after having con fronted h e r with
reality as h e saw it, tried to help h e r stand up to w hat she w anted.
H e also tried to find-the reason for th e unconscious producing
such a seem ingly hopeless thing o r to helpj h e r renounce w hat she
desired— knowing th at h e r pain would provide the sam e opportu-
nity to suffer. B u t w h ich ever way th e dream s w ent, he was always
confron ted with th e sam e refusal from this w om an to face reality.
A secretive sort o f smile revealed that she was not believing a
w ord o f th e reality he was describing, o r perhaps the grapes w ere
too sour if renunciation w ere to com e on th e vine. In o th er words,
the w om an indulged h e r desire and every kind o f fantasy and plot
and refu sed all his efforts to bring it down to brass tacks. The
animus got fa tter and fatter, possessed h e r daily m ore com pletely,
until th e analysis en d ed in disaster.
   Personally, I don’t believe this analyst could have done a
thing. I f a w om an will not face reality, no one can help her.
Ju n g continues:


      A woman can be possessed by a real man, but that is only
      because there is an animus projection, as a man can be really
      possessed by a woman through an anima projection. So it
140                The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



       boils down to the subjective condition in oneself; it is due to
       your indulgence in your desires. If you haveput your anima.

       In other words, that solidification or crystallization means
       that the situation has become habitual, and in as much as
       the self-control, or non-indulgence has become a habit, it
       is a stone. The more it has become a habit, the harder, the
        stronger, that stone will be, and when it has become a fait
       accompli it is a diamond. Then you are no longer conscious
       of your concupiscentia.44


      I bring this idea o f Jung’s here because it throws an interesting
light on the diamond, which is one o f the symbols o f the Self, par-
ticularly in the E ast, w here the making of the so-called “diamond
body” is so im portant. However, it would lead us m uch too far
afield to go further into this aspect at present.
      In the w om ans vision, we h ear later th at the m an who com es
out o f the am ber:


       is a different kind of animus. The wrong animus has been a
       substitute for the real animus. The real animus should not be
       bottled up. The conservation of the animus inside a bottle is
       transitory. It must be so until one is absolutely safe, because
       when there is a remnant of the old concupiscentia and one
       opens the bottle, then out comes the evil spirit and takes pos­
       session of one and d o -^ one goes again. But if the situation
       is fairly safe; if the stone has been made, then one can open

        the bottle and out comes the new animus. Then one can see
        how he behaves and what he does.45

     W e w ere told in th e w om an’s vision th at the m an could only
g et out o f the am b er w hen th e w om an spilled h e r blood upon it.
I m ust rem ind you fu rth er th at he cam e out bound w ith thongs
and p ierced with many arrows. She drew out th e arrow s as gently
as she could and freed him o f his fetters. Ju n g com m en ts th at the
w om an had to fe tte r th e old opinionating anim us so as to stop his
opinions and take things for w hat they really are.46 In this im age,
the arrows can- b e seen as the insights th a t p ierce th e opinionating
veil o f th e animus.

F o r instance, take the w om an w ho let h erself be ch eated o f h e r
analysis. She could not only have told him to wait, thus binding o r
gluing him down, but she could have tu rn ed his insinuations back
on him and said to him : “You have a m ind like a sewer, full o f the
filthiest opinions. You suspect Dr. So-and-So o f being a heartless
D on Juan— con trary to everything one hears o f him , and th en you
insinuate th at I will betray m y husband w ithout th e faintest evi-

his spear and he gets it instead o f th e w om an. Ju n g notes later:

        So the suppression of the anima or the animus is an act of
        extreme violence and cruelty; only being hard and cruel can
        one suppress even to that relative degree. And naturally the

      animus through such a process gets quite sore and has to be
      made whole afterwards. All those attempts at tying him do^n
      have caused specific wounds which must be relieved. It is as
      if one had to make the animus conscious o f the fact that he
      is now different, he is now healed after the very harsh treat-
f     ment he received.47

    A vitally im portant point, and one w e are apt to b e very sen­
tim ental' about, is the fact that it requires cruelty to glue down
th e animus. W e have depended on him , spoiled and pam pered
him without realizing it, and thus it requires downright heroism
to tu rn against him. I will rep eat a story which I have told before
b ecause it is such a clear exam ple o f th e issue at hand. M any years
ago when I was on holiday in England, Miss W olff had w ritten
to m e that I should bring back m y fath ers small car with m e.48
At first I was furious and thought it utterly impossible, knowing
what store m y father set in his cars and how difficult it was even
to get perm ission to use one o f th em w hen I was th ere. A-Storm
o f \veUrknown convictions fired on m y argum ents with-Miss W olff
and whirled around in m y head afterw ard. However, I s.ucçeeded
in g lu in g th e m d ow n an d , with fear and courage, having decided
to tackle the issue, I approached him as ca^ily.as._pQssibIe. A nd.
to m y great. surprise he.gave. m e .th e c a r with no p ro b lem .atall. I
have always b een grateful to Toni W olff, for th at incident taught
m e in a co n crete p ro jected exam ple th e terrific difficulty o f going
against the animus and his fixed, irrefutable convictions. B ut it
m ust be done o r he will always rem ain the old opinionating devil,
and he will never transform .
   However, as we have seen, nothing ever rem ains as it was with
the unconscious— the tru th o f yesterday is the form ula o f today—
and w h e n th e animus h a s b een im prisQne d long enough, ,when~.

    L ater, in th e sam e seminar, the results o f this animus submis-
sion b eco m e clear. T he w om an now has to take the entire respon-
sibility for herself. Jung notes that being forced to assum e respon-
sibility for on eself is a m ost awkward and despicable situation.
O ne fears this responsibility and does not w ant to see things as
they are. W e generally p refer not to know w hat is happening in the
next room , for then we must take a stand. H e re one can no longer
deceive oneself and claim th at one doesn’t know w hat is going on.
It is naturally all monkey business, but it is indigenous to hum an
nature such that one can hardly rid oneself o f it. Tim e and again it

   As Jung expressed it on an oth er occasion, if one sheep leaves
the h erd and no longer grazes and m oves along with his com pany
o f sheep, the others— seeing it alone— will no longer recognize it.
T hey will think that it is an anim al th at is in the habit o f moving
alone by itself— such as a w olf o r b ear— and will actually regard
it as a com m on enemy.
    W e see h ere very clearly how o u r progress in analysis so often
seem s like a circle. W e com e back to the sam e w eary old place

w ho work on them selves earnestly, th e course is not really a circle
but a spiral. W e im prison th e animus, but then b eco m e afraid

out and he regresses to an opinionating dem on. B u t in tim e we
actually do shorten his rein as an unreal opinionating substitute.
And if we are in earnest and take a little m ore o f the responsibil­
ity for ourselves, th en we can stand th e tension a little bit longer.
Probably it is m uch too optim istic to hope th at one will ev er stand
it all the tim e. T h ese changes in hum an nature take generations,
if not centuries, to m ature. B ut at least we are contributing som e­
thing to what seem s to be one o f th e m ost essential problem s

animus, is a m an’s o r w om ans g reatest m erit.

Editor's Note: The following essay is based on a compilation of
stenographic notes taken primarily by Ulma G. Thomas during a
series of tw elve lectures given at the C. G. Jung Institute in Zürich
between October 26, 1953, and February 22, 1954. Ms. Thomas
writes that her rtotes are by no means complete, nor have they
been revised by Barbara Hannah. They are, nevertheless, exten-
sive. She also expresses the hope that errors have not crept
inadvertently into the text. As Ms. Thomas did not know at first
that she would be sharing her notes with others, her annotations
on the first lecture are brief and incomplete, comprising little more
than one page, but enough of Barbara Hannah's presentation is
otherwise documented so that the first lecture has been recon-
structed in a form accordant to the rest of the series. The notes of
several lecture participants, in particular a man identified only as
Dr. Fellowes, w ere also employed. Quite a bit of the material from
the previous essay repeat them selves in the opening lectures of
this series.

                              Le c t u e One
As w e all well know, th e animus personifies the spirit in woman
while the anim a represents the soul in man. In general w e can say
 that, at the m ore rudim entary levels, th e animus in the w om an is
 the p rod u cer o f "opinions” w hereas th e anim a in m an produces
^ o o d s . B u t actually the p art o f th e animus to w hich w e can react
 and with which w e can make co n ta ct is the m erest fraction o f the
entity o f spirit in th e w om an. In real_ life,__WQmffil_generalIy deal

This would b e “th e spirit o f rationalization” which indefatigably
occupies itself with making th ese opinions seem logical— at least
 as seen from the point o f view o f th e w om an or o f th e collec­
 tive society.

 m ore o r less corresponds to F re u d ’s co n cep t o f the entire uncon­

 able wellspring o f creativity and ideas, the expression o f which
w e can glimpse in works o f literature, art, music, o r dance, in
fairy tales and myths, in the prim itive, an cient, and contem porary

 rest o f the shadow (that is, from th e rest o f the unconscious) is a
lifelong task. Som e two thousand years ago, the Gnostic religions
(in particular the Valentinian school) form ulated four stages in
the individuation o f the animus and anima, or o f the individuals
relationship to the spirit and th e soul. T h ese Gnostics determ ined
the four stages as follows:

This level corresponds to th e initial level o f the developm ent of
th e animus, which is the phase o f th e phallus. T h e second level
is that o f H elen; in th e anim us, the husband. T h e third is Mary;
in th e anim us, th e lover. A nd th e h ighest level of individuation of
th e anim a is Sophia. F o r th e animus, this is the psychopom p, for

T he animus does his b est to swallow you and then despises you
w hen he succeeds.
   Logos and E ro s are principles by w hich we can orien t our-
selves in the world, b u t all four functions (thinking, feeling, intu-
ition, and sensation) are required to give a full p icture from the
standpoint o f eith er principle. I t is ju st as possible to live by the

    Picking up w here w e ended last w eek, I would like to begin by
pointing out that the principles o f eith er Logos or E ro s alone are
dry and sterile unless the o th er is contained within. It is the task o f
both w om an and m an to go beyond these potentially sterile forms
o f their own principles and, by integrating the opposite, change
them into whole and living forms. W h en difficulties arise betw een
m en and w om en, each looks at the o th er to find the cause. B ut
the difficulty lies in the fact th at it is so difficult to understand
ourselves, to see ou r own faces o r ou r own inner lives. Looking for
the sou rce o f the trouble in ourselves m eans searching for on e’s
o^wn principle. N othing but despair o r great love will provide a
w om an with the necessary im petus to have it out with h e r animus.
    W h en things are going well for us, w e are usually il). even
g re a te r danger o f identification with the animus. This led Jung
to speak o f “suffering su ccess,” som ething that is in one w ay even
hard er to take than failure. W h e n a relationship is going well,
then there is a particularly good ch an ce for the animus to whisper
that it m ust always continue like this now; the happy hour must
continue on forever.
   W h en a w om an works on herself, she m ust clearly realize that
there is an inner and an ou ter world. T h e animus is in its right
place w hen functioning in the unknown and invisible inner exis­
ten ce w here it belongs.' The w om an and h er animus are joined
to geth er like Siam ese twins, but neither can see the reality o f the
               Anim us Figures in Literature and in M od em Life



other. T h e anim us is like a natural bridge betw een us and the
inner w orld. Ju n g n otes that:

      the animus is meant to be cosmic; it is a function which
      should widen out the spiritual or mental possibilities into
      infinite space, as it were, into the infinity of the collective
      mind. Inasmuch as the animus is expanding into the great
      unconscious cosmos, he is really in his own element— there
      he belongs, that is his home.4

       F o r this woman was beset with many animus devils, they
      were all over the place, and then through the whole proce-
       dure of these visions, the process of transformation, her mind
       . . . became imprisoned in the earth, in the up-coming Yin
       material, in the female, the mother, and slowly her animus
       was suppressed. She no longer had opinions about things as
       she assumed they should be, but gave the material a chance
       to speak its own mind. So things began to happen to her,
       thoughts came to her, and she stopped having opinions about
       things which ought to come to her, not seeing what actually
       was happening. That unreal negative animus prevents the
       accurate perception of psychological facts, always putting
       an opinion in the place of the actual perception. As soon as

    152            The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



          a woman perceives a thing, the animus steps in and says it is
          something quite different, and thus the actual experience is
          secretly falsified. Instead of a real experience a mere empty
          opinion is substituted about what it ought to be, or what it
          possibly might be. Now she has learned to experience objec-
/         tively, to see the things which really happen, and that has
          imprisoned her animus.
              [It is an] extraordinary accomplishment . . . for a woman
          to put the animus aside, to say, “I will put you into a test tube
          for later analysis.” Now putting the thing into a test tube, or
          into a cauldron, is the beginning of the alchemical procedure;
          the imprisonment of the animus or of the anima is for the
          purpose of transformation. This is a real process of sublima­
          tion; there is no sublimation of sex, that is imagination. This
          is a transformation, not of sex, but of forms, of experiences.
          Through imprisonment, the animus becomes peculiarly
          changed, he is stripped of his world, for when a thing is in a
          test tube . . . with a stopper, externai influences are excluded
          and the thing is undisturbed inside. And so it does not disturb
          one’s surroundings; in that way the most dangerous microbes
          can be kept in one’s room without infection, because nothing
          can get into the test tube and nothing can get out. Sowhen
          the gnirous. cannot get out into the externai atgiosphexe, and
          he hasno object,then he has}im e tqJransform.
             You see, the main point in this transformation is that one
          takes objects away from these animus and anima devils. They
          are only interested in objects if you allow yourself to indulge in
          something. Concupiscentia is the term for that in the church,
          it was particularly stressed by St. Augustine; or convoitise in
          French; or “desire” in English; or Begehrlichkeit in German. It
          is the point at which all the great religions come together. The
          fire of desirousness is the element that must be fought against
          in Buddhism, in Brahmanism, in Tantrism, in Manichaeism,
          in Christianity, and it is a term in psychology [as well]. You
          see, when you indulge in desirousness, whether your desire
          is towards heaven or towards hell, you are giving the animus
       Anim us Figures in Literature and in M odern L ife            153,



or anima an object; they are then turned out into the world
instead of staying in their place within, so what s h o ld be of
the night is of the day, and what should be under your feet is
on top of you . . . . But if you are governed by your„.desires you
are naturally possessed. A w qm anm axbe possessed. by a real
man, b u tth at is only because there is an.animus projection
[just] asain an may be possessed hy a real womanthrough. an
^ m y 3roje£.t;i,çJl. So it boils down to the subjective condition
in yourself: it is due to your indulgence in your desires. If you
have put your animus or anima into a bottle, you are free from
possession, though there is of course a bad time inside and you
will feel it because when your devil is having a bad time, you
will have a bad time. You must know whether it is your good
spirit or your bad spirit, for if the negative animus is having a
bad time, you can enjoy it. Of course he will rumble in your
entrails, you can always see that it is right after a time. You
slowly get quiet and transform, and you wiU discover that in
that bottle grows the stone— the amber, or the Lapis. In other
words, that solidification or crystallization simply means that
the situation has become a habit, it is a stone. The more it has
become a habit, the harder, the stronger that stone will be,
and when it has become afait accompli, it is a diamond. Then
you are no longer conscious of your concupiscentia . . . .
    The man who comes out of the stone is a different kind
of animus. The wrong animus has been a substitute for the
real one. The real animus should not be bottled up. The
conservation of the animus inside a test tube is transitory. It
must be so until one is absolutely safe, because if one opens
the bottle when there is anything still left of the old concupis­
centia, out comes the evil spirit and takes possession of one,
and down one goes again. But if the situation is fairly safe, if
the stone has been made, then one can open it and the new
animus appears. Then one can see how he behaves and what
he does . . . . Women usually do not understand the animus
at all, it is as if they were completely blind. It is really true
that there is a mental f unction in women that prevents her
   154               The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



          from looking things in the face . . . . Our patient went at the
          animus, catching him and tying him down until she arrived
          at an immediate experience. The animus is a sort of film
          between reality and a woman’s mind, she always talks about
          things as they should be, so when she says a thing is really so,
          it is really not so at all . . . . The animus is like a mist before
          her eyes and it needs a careful systematic self-education to
          penetrate that illusive mist.6

j over the place, blocking and preventing us from 1 proceeding.

      A wom an has to banish opinions that com e betw een h er and

  that contains the impersonal animus, and this gives us a valu-

thana or “mindfulness,” where one attempts to observe and detach oneself from the polari-
ties of strife, physical suffering, the emotions, and so forth and seeks a form of union beyond
the worldly rêalm of animus and anima opinions, ego convictions, and the like. However, the
activity of satipatthana, that is, mindful detachment, is not simply passive withdrawal but
definitely fulfills the desire for awakening. In essence, Barbara Hannah has defined some­
thing similar here. There are no known instances of her having access to or having studied
such Buddhist concepts. Ed.]

  unctio o f “gum with gum ” as a “spiritual m arriage.”
I    W om en, who in the old days u sed to be submissive to m en,
  may find them selves in the position today o f being submissive to
 the animus. W h en speaking ab ou t how the animus m anipulates a
 woman, Jung m entions the exam ple o f a girl who, when looked at
 by a man, im m ediately translates th at look into the en tire history
 o f h er life and ends up seeing h erself as an old grandm other. This
 m ay have som e natural and instinctual elem ents o f desire in it,
 because desirousness is the cru x o f n atu re, but a way o f keeping
 desire in hand is by confronting it w:ith reality, w hereas here the
 animus twists that reality into images that cause h er to im m edi­
 ately cu t off relatedness and distance h erself and close h erself off
 from the man. I am rem inded h ere o f a w om an w ho, dissatisfied
 w:ith a Freu d ian analysis, w ent to a m ale Jungian analyst and cam e
 away feeling for oncp very m uch understood. H ere was a psycho-
 analyst who she felt could help her. B u t then she thought: “I am
 a m arried woman, and I might fall in love . . . , ” and this prospect
 was so awful that she got all u p set and decided to leave m atters
 be and forgo the analysis, thus forfeiting w hat may have been a
 valuable experience.
    N evertheless, a way o f keeping desirousness in hand is by
 confronting it w:ith reality. You m ust face the situation as it is, take
 every disagreeable con seq u en ce, carry every responsibility, and
 stand up for what one wants and needs. B u t if we make up our
 minds to renounce, then we m ust also stand to that. T h ere must

W e left o ff last w eek with th e am ber. W e spoke about how the
vision d iscussed by Jung in his Visions sem inar gave us a hint as to
how w e could im prison the anim us. A nd we discussed the thesis
from M aria Prophetissa about gum m arrying gum. T h at is, in “the
natural sap o f th e tre e ,” we can stop o u r opinions about every-
thing in ou r daily life. In th ese sam e seminar's, Jung continues in
his discussion o f the im ages:


       We have the man bound by thongs and pierced by arrows.
       An arrow is a thing which goes swiftly and penetrates, like
       thoughts: they are shafts of light, or of insight that pierce
       the veil of the animus. A woman must pierce and penetrate
       because she is always held in mid-air by that mirage between
       herself and reality. This woman has pierced the mist, for this
       is the real animus. She says: “I drew the arrows forth as gently
       as I could and freed him of this fetters.”9


   T h e T ibetan B ook o f the D ead speaks o f the icicle and o f the
psychic bolt sent out with the intent to kill. B u t th ere are also
m any primitive stories about the w itch d octor sending out the
icicle o r the bolt to h u rt his enem ies and afterward having to be
careful b ecau se the bolt always com es back. Jung m entions a sha-
m an -w itch d octor who hung up his co at on a scarecrow out in a
field so th at the angry bolt would retu rn to it instead o f to him.
O n ce it arrives back, he “w orries it” until it gets tired. B y working
on the “bolt” o r “boom erang” o r “icicle,” the evil spirit is rem oved
and thus can n ot hurt him. Only then does he put it back in his
pock et for future u se.10W h e re the animus tries to disrupt a pleas-
ant co n tact o r interview, one can then tell him to wait until w e can
talk it out. B u t when one makes. it a rule to turn the negativity back
on him , then he gets wounded, the arrows are turned back on him
as though one had said to him: “You have a m ind like the main
sewage line, full o f horrible suspicions.” T h en the spear is bent

back on him, inflicting a wound. O ne would feel bad th at one had
such an animus, b u t that is far b e tte r than identifying with him.
       Since the animus has been w ounded, the w om an should make
him whole. In his Visions seminar, Ju n g notes that this healing is
im plied in the idea o f drawing out the arrow s. H e w rites:

/
        For what one has to do to the animus is thorough, it is vio-
        lence. Don’t forg e t that to_be possessed bythe animus or the

        into slavery We don't know to what extent we are possessed,
        it is probably that liberation is very relative. So the suppres-
        sion of the anima or the animus is an act of extreme violence
        and cruelty, only by being hard and cruel can one suppress
        these powers completely— relatively completely that is. And
        the animus through such a process gets quite sore and has
        to be made whole afterwards; all those attempts at tying him
        do^n have caused specific wounds which must be relieved
        or healed. It is as if one had to make the animus conscious of
        the fact that he is now different, he is now healed of the very
        harsh treatment he received before. This is a vitally impor­
        tant point and one we are apt to be very sentimental about.
        One feels the most extraordinary disloyalty.11

    B ack to th e Visions seminar, Jung continues:

      After she had freed him from his fetters he ran with great
      fleetness away from me until he came to a great precipice.
      Then he called like Icarus “I will fly.” I answered: “And like
      Icarus you will be killed.” Slowly and with great sorrow he
      walked back toward me and knelt down beside me.
           So the animus tries to run away, to take his former posi-
       tion in the world of things, he wants to jump out into space
       and fill space again with his illusions. And he wants to reach
       the impossible, the sun. But she tells him: “No chance for
       you to fly about and create more illusions; you stay right
       here, no opinionating here,” and so he obediently lies down
       beside her. 12        .

 not know w hat he was going to do, how could I be responsible?”
 O f course anybody could know it if they only w anted to. So in the
 m om en t th at th e animus is obedient, this w om an has to assume
 responsibility. T h en she has to live with seeing eyes, w hich is
 exceedingly difficult. Things are so much easier apparently when

 one doesn’t see through them ; th en everything runs m ore or less
 smoothly, and one always can say it was ju st by ch an ce that such
  and such a thing happened. B u t w hen one sees, it is altogether too
  clear how one prearranged the w hole show.
      So we don’t exactly know h ere w hat the trouble will be, but
/ we can be quite sure that if she is controlling h er anim us, she will
  g et into a situation that is exceedingly difficult, because h e will be
 put to a test. T hat is always so in reality. It is like a challenge. F o r
 when a m an controls his anim a, o r a w om en h e r animus, they are
 doing som ething nobody would dream o f doing, b ecause since
 eternity, since the world began, mankind has b een possessed.
 And when you dare to dispossess yourself, you g et into a differ-
 en t ord er o f things, which m eans a challenge to the old order; no
 sooner do you get rid o f a devil than you have all the devils against
 you. If a m an makes a m odest a ttem p t at controlling his anima, he
 will be right away in a situation w here he is tested to the blood;
 all the devils o f the world will try to get into his anim a in ord er
 to bring him back into the fold o f m oth er nature. F o r h e gets out
 o f the ordinary level o f th e flock if he even tries to m ake such an
 attem pt. T he sam e with a w om an; every available devil circulating
 within one hundred miles will do his best to g et the goat of the
 animus. Controlling the animus o r anim a is like creating a vacuum
 and everything m ust rush in to fill it. T h erefore people who make
 an attem p t to be in con trol over these figures m eet o th er condi-
 tions which alm ost force them back to their form er state. It works
 quite autom atically.13
    As Jung expressed it on another occasion, if one sheep leaves
 the h erd and no longer lives in the com pany o f the others, the rest
 o f the h erd will not recognize it as a sheep but will regard it as an
 animal moving by itself and thus a com m on enem y. G retch en , in
 Faust, laughs at the girl who is going to have a baby and afterward
 sees how she acted as one o f th e h erd and how easy it was to
 blam e the oth er and just be one o f th e pack. As Jung says above:

15. [Although Rebecca 'West was hailed by Time magazine as “the world’s number one
woman’s writer,” the diversity and generic indeterminacy of her writings make it difficult to
assess her literary status. She is probably better known for her nonfiction— reportage, travel,
history, biography, literary criticism— than for her sometimes overintellectualized novels.
Her writing showed a brilliance of intellect and a lucidity of style. Her distinction was to
write about the factual world with formidable erudition, but also with an imaginative aware-
ness of its ambiguities. Although Wests range and versatility might suggest a protean liter­
ary personality, her writing voice was, at any time and in any genre, instantly recognizable,
and her preoccupying myths remained largely the same throughout her long life. First and
foremost she was a writer— of rhythmic, majestic, epiphanic, occasionally narcissistic prose.

16. Rebecca West (1892-1983) came of age during World War I, was disillusioned, at times
angered, by the attitude of Western society toward women, was sobered by the difficulties
that ended her first relationship, to H. G. Wells; and spoke out decisively against the fa scism
enveloping Europe in the 1930s as well as against the looming prospects of Nazism. During
World War II, W est was a “talks supervisor” at the BBC in London. Her writings on the
Nuremberg trials were collected in A Train o f Pow der (1955); essays on Britons who worked
for Germany during World War II appeared in The Meaning o f Treason (1949). Although
West had written for socialist newspapers in the-beginning of her career, she actively sup-
ported the crusade against Communists in the United States in the 1950s. She explored
theories of creativity and cognition in her nonfiction work The Strange Necessity (1928),
and in St. Augustine (1933) she explores Augustine’s impact on Western thought. Richard

Tillinghast writes: “To read West is to encounter the tradition of English prose at its kinetic
and sensuous best: she breathes life into a sentence . . . [her] roots reaching back to Sir
Thomas Browne, Shakespeare, and Cicero— and she is philosophically grounded in English
empiricism. On every page one finds simple sentences that evoke a wholesome sense of ma-
teriality . . . At times the writing elevates itself into poetry” (“Rebecca West and the Tragedy
of Yugoslavia, The New Criterion 10 (June 1992), p. 12). Her literary career spanned more
than seventy years. At the end of her life, she was England’s foremost woman of letters,
receiving the title Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1959. West died
in London on 15 March 1983 at age ninety-nine. One of her more famous quotes is “I myself
have never been able to find out what feminism is; I only know that people call me a feminist
whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat or a prostitute. Ed.]

be found in Appendix 1. See also the literary review by Edith H. Walton (New York Tines,
 February 3, 1935), which adds ample evidence to complement Barbara Hannahs discussion
of the animus. Ed.]

story, the m an m urders his wife with no thought as to the conse-

was involved in at one time, she wrote: “There is no such thing as conversation. It is an il-

Tragedy of Yugoslavia,” The New Cdterion 10 (June 1992), p. 12). Ed.]

    In conclusion for today, I w ould like to add th at the animus in
these stories appears to be heavily influenced by n in eteen th -cen -
tury m aterialism and the spirit o f those tim es, w hich gave birth
to the psychologies o f m en such as Sigm und F re u d and Alfred

o f Ju n g and o f the freely m oving creative spirit. (It is also interest-

T h e question was asked about the e ffect th at a mild and indul-
gen t fath er would have on a d au gh ter’s animus. T h e answ er is
th at h e could produce a kind o f F a th e r C hristm as animus, and
the daughter w ould be likely to rem ain infantile. Such a daughter
n ever believes a “n o .” E v e n w hen a m an says “N o !” to her, she
is still convinced th at eventually he will say “Yes.” I f you have a
negative anim us, it is difficult to believe in the positive, and with
a positive animus, it is equally problem atical to a cce p t the nega­
tive. Ju n g on ce used the rath e r brash m etaphor likening a wom an
w ith a F a th e r C hristm as animus to a tick waiting on a bush for a
w arm -b lood ed animal to pass u n derneath so it could drop on it. It
could w ait for many years, n ever even thinking o f giving up. W ith
both th e very positive and very negative animus the wom an is cut
off from reality.

       T he animus has num erous facets and tends to project itself
onto the m en who correspond to th em . O n the oth er hand,
he m ay also p ro ject onto his opposite, but this depends on the
W eltanschauung o f the animus. Som e w om en’s animi project
with the purpose o f obtaining a relationship, but this m ay not be
phrough th e feeling principle. T he anim us appears how and w hen
he wants.
   As an aside h ere, two points: first, one is often driven to the
conclusion in w om en’s books that th e animus is obliterating his
own traces and stage-m anaging th e w hole thing; and second, it is
often difficult, if not impossible, to discover th e anim us in books
w ritten by w om en prior to the nineteenth century, for example,

link up with th e case w h ere the anim us is left in the outside world.

four novels, eight plays, one biography, and twenty volumes of journals and letters in which
she explored the lives of English aristocrats and satirized their social pretensions and per­
sonal foibles. She directed her eye to larger questions such as the politics of womans identity.
   Maria Edgeworth (1768-1849) was an eminent Irish literary intellectual, educationist,
and writer on class, race, and gender. Her mother died when Maria was six. As the eldest
child, she was close to her father, the Anglo-Irishman Richard Lovell Edgeworth, who was a
writer, scientist, and educationist. He saw that she got an excellent education and profoundly
influenced her work, reading and editing almost everything she produced while he was alive.
One of Edgeworths first publications was her feminist essay, Letters f o r Literary Ladies

historical novel, producing numerous literary works and influencing younger writers such as

gian John Pord age w rote to th e alchem ist Jane L ea d e (his “mysti-
cal sister”) regarding th e coniunctio and the opus. H e describes
the ch aracteristics o f M ars and the type o f coniunctio M ars needs.
M ars, he notes, is choleric, h e is too sharp and too fiery. H e is
quick to anger, oftentim es w rathful and jealous. His fire tends to
dry up and b u m . Juxtaposed to him , the love-fire o f Venus has the
qualities o f th e right and the tru e fire. P o rd age w rites:


      Accordingly, if you think to become a learned artist, look with
      earnestness to the union of your own Mars and Venus, that
      the nuptial knot be rightly tied and the marriage between
      them well and truly consummated. You must see to it that
      they lie together in the bed of their union and live in sweet
      harmony; then the virgin Venus will bring forth her pearl, her
      water-spirit in you to soften the fiery spirit of Mars, and the
      wrathful fire of Mars will sink quite willingly in mildness and
      love, into the love-fire of Venus, and thus both qualities, as
      fire and water, will mingle together, agree, and flow into one
      another; and from their agreement and union there will pro-
      ceed the first conception of the magical birth which we call
      tincture, the love-fire tincture. Now although the tincture is
      conceived in the womb of your humanity and is awakened to
      life, yet there is still a great danger, and it is to be feared that,
      because it is still in the body or womb, it may yet be spoiled
      by neglect.20


P ord ag e goes on to w rite th at this union o f Venus and M ars, this

“into the resin .” I f this is so, it w ould be an o th er reason why she
has such a pow erful opinionating substitute. All these stories end
badly. In a way, th erefore, I think this shows that she is consider-
ably less the animus dupe than th e novelist who only goes as far
as the w edding and makes that th e happy end. H e re , in just this
one thing, h er animus does not deceive her. T h erefore I would say
that she is p retty well possessed by the animus and lets him m an-
age the stories offstage y et is n ot quite identical with him. One
could say: “B u t she is a good w riter; and life- actu allyis as..sh o :n

the deceptive thing about the animus.- H e always tells half-truths.
In the first story, it is suggested that the whole relationship was
w reck ed by the fact that the m an funked, that is, shrank back
from his m arriage and w anted to stop the whole thing. B u t that
is both true and not true. I f the w om an had really b een properly
rooted in h er relationship, she would have accep ted his apology
on the wedding night and we would have h eard no m ore. about
it, that is, if h e r love had b een stronger than h e r pow er urge. The
animus opinion quite ignores the d eep er layers. I think this is a
responsibility to w hich authors, especially w om en, have not really
woken up since such stories have an enorm ous influence on ado-
lescent girls. At bottom , R eb e cca W e st does not describe relation-

 a big role in w om en’s argum ents. I f she is ridden by the animus,
no logic on earth can convince her, no m atter how friendly and

that only physical force can have any effect on his wife and does
not realize that a dram atically ch arged situation would soon fali
to pieces if he would leave the field o f battle to his wife and just
walk out. B u t this healing idea rarely gets through to him because
no m an can carry on a conversation with the animus (for even the
shortest tim e) without im m ediately falling victim to his anima. If
he listened with detachm ent, h e would realize how com m onplace
the discussion is. A recording o f the conversation would be most
enlightening. This apparently extraordinary situation is due to
the fact that when animus and anima m eet, the animus seizes
his sword o f pow er and the anim a sprays h er poison. B oth are
under the delusion that the age-old platitudes they u tter are co m ­
pletely unique. W h eth er positive o r negative, the anim us-anim a
relationship is always em otional and thus rooted in the collective
unconscious, and this brings it down to a general instinctive basis.

understands the father”— and she is rem oved to a land o f sheep
w here she is tended to by the animus. T he positive animus can
function as interm ediary to the unconscious.
   In principle, th e effect. of. the. anim a and the. animus. on..the
ego are similar. It is difficult to elim inate them partly on account
o f the authority,they hold and p artly because they are projected.
I am inclined to consider the archetype to be responsible for this

effect w hich is indeed p resent. And it is this fact th at explains the
totally irrational moods and opinions w hich do not lay them selves
open to discussion o f any kind. T he notorious impossibility o f
influencing th ese moods and opinions is due to the fascination
o f th e archetype, which hypnotizes and imprisons consciousness.
Som etim es th e ego feels this as a m oral defeat, and the feeling
o f inferiority is in creased so as to p reven t relationship. Through
education, w e have already learn ed th at w e are not one hund red
p e rce n t p u re gold. It seem s natural th at w om en should have opin­
ions and m en m oods. This situation has an instinctive foundation.
N ature is conservative and is not easy to disturb, and animus and
anim a d efend their rights to th e last ditch. Having a profound
doubt as to th e wisdom o f forcing som ething upon nature with
w hich it w ould have b een b e tte r not to in terfere, we then perhaps
feel as if w e should not bring things to consciousness. T h e major-
ity o f people have difficulty understanding the animus and anim a
b ecau se th ese lie beyond th e sphere o f th e ordinary. This arouses
prejudices and taboos.
    W h en w e decide that w e m ust take back| our projections,
th en w e are en terin g unexplored territory. This has far-reaching
effects. B y no m eans are all contents o f animus and anim a pro-
jecte d ; m any can be m ade conscious by dream s, active im agina­
tion, and so forth. T hese show th at thoughts, feelings, and affects
exist in us with w hich we had not reckoned. Anyone who him self
has n ot had such an experien ce finds such a possibility absolutely
fantastic since a norm al person “knows w hat he thinks.” H ow ever,
should h e su cceed in realizing these things, he cannot fail to be
deeply im pressed. Nowadays th e grow ih o f such knowledge is
extrem ely rare. One usually needs to pay for it with a neurosis or
som ething w orse.22
     H id d en in th e figures o f th e anim us and anim a is the autonom y
o f th e collective unconscious. T h ey personify its contents which,
w hen no lon ger p rojected , can be in tegrated into consciousness.

 is due to th e fact that th e contents o f th e animus and anim a can

is extrem ely well done.
    C ontinuing our translation last w eek o f Jung’s discussion in
Aion o f th e anim us and anim a, I w ould like to point out th at Jung
speaks vividly o f th e extraordinarily fatal, even tragic influence on
h u m an fate lying in the hands o f th ese forces o f th e unconscious.
T h ey really are the father and m oth er o f all disastrous entangle-
m ents o f fate and have b een known as such since antiquity. O ur
forefathers, realizing th eir pow ers, rightly called th em gods.
This pair o f gods thus moves into th e ce n te r o f the psychologi-
cal field— w h ere they belong— w h eth er w e recognize this fact or
not. Jung notes th at by calling th em by this nam e w e grant them
th e cen tral position in th e sp ectru m o f psychological values that

he notes, are extrem ely helpful w hen w e try to realize th e value
o f these figures. It is only w hen we cast light into the dark depths
and tortuous ways o f m an’s fate that w e see the full magnitude
o f th e influence o f th ese two figures w hich com p lem en t hum an

th e shadow, th at is, the making conscious o f the personal uncon­
scious, is th e first step in th e analytical process, w hereas it is
im possible to realize either animus o r anima until considerable

while the o th er half is tran scen d en t. T h e whole th en constitutes
a quaternity, an archetype th at Ju n g has called the “m arriage
quaternio.”27 This quaternity is a p attern o f the Self reflected , for
instance, in cross-cousin m arriages in earlier cultures. T h e Self
is an im age o f G od, indistinguishable from G od himself. E arly
Christians such as .C lem ent o£'Alèxandnâ' show cognizance o f this
fact when they say things such as: “H e who lmows him selflm ow s

Ja n e A u sten
I would now like to turn to th e author Jan e Austen, beginning
with a short biographical sketch anql then moving on to a discus­
sion o f h er literary works.
   Jan e A usten was born on 16 D e ce m b e r 1 7 7 5 at Steventon,
H am pshire, England. She was th e seventh o f eight children and
the second o f two daughters. H e r father, the R everend G eorge
A usten (1 7 3 1 -1 8 0 5 ), was a clergym an o f the local C hurch of
England. This was the e ra o f the A m erican W ar o f Independence,
the F re n ch Revolution, and the victories and defeats o f Napoleon.
The reign o f G eorge III was a political nightm are, his m ental
health already stretch ed to th e breaking point after struggles
with F ra n ce . Then there was the d efeat o f the British troops
in Yorktown in the A m erican colonies and a fiery in tem al strife
with his own prim e minister, W illiam Pitt. As his m ental health
d eteriorated and he b ecam e all b u t a buffoon on the throne, his
son G eorge was appointed to the undaunting position o f R egent,
w here he attem pted to rule in th e face o f the increasingly erratic

26. Ibid.

and hum iliating nature o f his fath ers condu ct. T h e final years
o f Jan e A u sten s life w ere thus spent u n d er the reign o f the
P rin ce R egen t G eorge w ho, after the death o f his father, b ecam e
G eorge IV.28
   A lthough Jan e A usten was highly unpopular with som e people,
G eorge IV was a great ad m irer and kept a set o f h e r books at
each o f his residences. Ja n e ’s brother, w ho b écam e ill in London,
was treated by the sam e d octor who treated th e P rin ce R egen ts
librarian, and through this d o cto r his Royal H orior passed the
m essage on to Jan e granting h e r perm ission to dedicate h e r next
book personally to him. She deferred, claiming th at the m anner
in which h e treated his wife C aroline was unacceptable. B u t Jane
was th e re a fte r inform ed that the “perm ission” could be under-
stood as royal com m and.
   T h e F re n c h Revolution took p lace w hen Jane was in h er
youth; M aria A ntoinette and Louis IV w ere guillotined w hen she
was eighteen. H e r first cousin, E liza, was m arried to a F re n ch
aristo crat who was similarly b eh ead ed , and a cousin o f E liza mar­
ried Ja n e s fourth brother, H enry; th e F re n c h Revolution thus
closely tou ch ed the A usten family. Y et all of Jan e A ustens books
have such p e a c e f ul settm gs, and .they.. lack. g re a tp o lit j caL events

    H e r fath er had b een a re c to r o f the C h u rch o f England for
fifteen years prior to h e r birth and rem ain ed in that position for
forty years, Jan e living with him until she was twenty-five. Mr.
A usten h im self was known as a cultivated m an and an excellent
scholar. Jan e undoubtedly ow ed h e r unrivalled literary style and
use o f th e English language to h e r father. H e was not wealthy,
bu t th eir family was certainly well off. Jan e was, in fact, well con-
n e cte d on h e r m o th ers side o f the family as well.
     She was ed u cated for only a few short years at two differ-
e n t boarding schools b efore the age o f nine, as she insisted on
accom panying h er old er sister to school. H e r m o th er said that
if C assandra was “going to have h er head cut off,” then Jane

could insist on sharing h er fate. T h ey attended th eir first school
in Southam pton for a short tim e b efore an epidem ic o f “putrid
fever” broke o u t.29 B oth w ere brought h om e ill by th eir aunt, a
Mrs. C ooper, who also cau gh t th e fever and died. T h e girls then
attended the Abbey Boarding School in Reading (w hich appar-
i n t l y bore som e resem blance to M rs. G oddard’s casual school in
 Emima), b u t their education th ere was soon concluded. T h ereafter
 they w ere ed u cated at hom e, learning to draw, play th e piano, and
so forth. Jan e Austen did a fair am ount o f reading o f both the
serious and the popular literature o f the day (h e r fath er had a
library o f five hundred books by 1 8 0 1 ), and she was familiar w ih
eigh teen th -cen tury novels. As she said, she and h e r family w ere
great novel readers and not asham ed o f being so. H e r father took
on o th er pupils to educate with his own sons and apparently saw
to it that h er general education was n ot neglected.
    T h ere is no authentic p ortrait o f Jan e Austen. A t twelve, she
was not particularly pretty b u t prim , whimsical, and affected. H e r
nephew describes h er as having an attractive figure, being rather
tall and slender, and says that h e r step was light and firm. She
had a small m outh and nose, light hazel eyes, and brow n hair that
was naturally curly; h er com plexion was that o f a clear brunette.
H e r real charm lay obviously in h e r expression w hich, naturally,
varied. Childhood, happy and vital,. resem bled.the-liives o f m ost
o f the heroines in- h er novels. T h ere was a great deal o f social
life; balls in neighboring towns w ere the great events, and .we can
say that the setting o f h er books lies within h er own experience.
Jane Austen enjoyed social events, and h er early letters tell o f
dances and parties she atten d ed in H am pshire and also o f visits
to London, Bath, and Southam pton, w here she attended plays
and o th er social affairs. T h ere is a fam ous statem en t by one Mrs.
M itford that Jane was the “the prettiest, silliest, m ost affected,
husband-hunting butterfly she e v er rem em b ers.” (H ow ever, Mrs.
Mitford seem s to have harbored a personal jealousy o f Jane, and
it is hard to reconcile this description with the Jane Austen who
w rote The T h ree Sisters before she was eighteen.XD es.pite a cou-

   C assandra E lizab eth was Ja n e ’s only sister and h e r closest con-
fidante. H undreds o f letters exchanged b etw een the two show the
intim acy and ca re th ey shared. C assandra’s fiancé, Thom as Fow le,
a m ilitary chaplain, died o f yellow fever in th e C aribbean in 1797.
T h ey h ad n o t b e e n able to m arry du e to financial restrictions, and
after his d eath C assandra was n ever en gaged again. F iv e o f h er
six b roth ers m arried (two w ere adm irals in th e British Navy), four
o f th em ^vice, so th a t h e r b roth ers had a total o f nine wives. B oth
sisters w ere keen on th eir status as aunts and always em phasized
th e im p o rtan ce o f th eir role am ong th eir nieces and nephews.
Jan e frequently visited h e r b ro th ers and th eir families as well as
o th er relatives and friends.
     Probably only C assandra knew why Jane never m arried. In
h e r la te r years, C assandra o p e n e d up to a lim ited exten t to h e r
nephew s and sh ared som e o f h e r m em ories, and we know a little
from Jan e’s letters. Sh e had a friend, a M rs. Lefroy, who was
la te r killed by a fall from h e r horse, an in cid en t w e find in one of,
Jan e ’s few poem s. W h e n Jan e was twenty, she had a considerable^
 flirtation with M rs. L e fro y s nephew, Tom, b ut it is difficult to
 assess how m u ch this m ean t to her. It seemingly lacked serious
 co m m itm e n t on his side, for h e n ever retu rn ed to his aunts. Jane
 said w hen h e left th at “th e day is co m e on which I am to flirt my
 last w ith Tom Lefroy, and w hen you will receive this [letter] it
 will b e over. M y tears flow at th e m elancholy idea.” B u t w hether
 this was m ean t seriously o r sarcastically is difficult to tell. (Like
 h e r sister, she laughed openly at th e absurd w herever she found
 it.) H ow ever, any seriousness on his p art may have b een stymied
 by th e fact th at h e could not afford to indulge his hopes because
 h e was not financially in th e position to m arry Jane. (H e eventu-
 ally m arried an Irish lady who was quite wealthy. M any years
 later, after he had b eco m e C h ief Ju stice o f Ireland, he confessed
 to his nephew th at he had had a “boyish love” for Jan e Austen.)

 o f these holidays that Jane A ustens m ost mysterious rom antic
 incident occu rred . All that is known is w hat C assandra told vari-
 ous nieces years after Jane A ustens death. W hile th e family was
 staying som ew here on the coast (probably in south D evonshire,
 w est o f L ym e), Jane Austen m et a young m an who seem ed to
/C a ssa n d ra to have quite fallen in love with Jane. C assandra later
 spoke highly o f him and thought he would have b een a successful
 suitor. Accordingly, "they p arted— but he m ade it plain he should
 seek h e r out again.” How ever, shortly afterw ard they heard of
 his death! T h ere is no evidence as to how seriously this disap-
 pointm ent affected Jane, b u t a n u m b er o f people have w ondered
 w h eth er or not Jan e A ustens 1 8 1 7 novel, P ersuasion, might not
 reflect this experience to som e d egree w h ere life is transm uted
 into art. Jan e Austen would have b een tw enty-seven (the age of
 Anne Elliot, the heroine o f P ersuasion) during 1 8 0 2 -1 8 0 3 , and a
 crucial scen e in Persuasion takes place in L ^ n e .
    In conclusion for today, I would like to add a thought that
 E m m a Jung shared with m e. D uring the sum m er holidays, she
 read E m m a Gljl.skell’s L ife o fC h a rlo tte B ronte and Jan e A ustens

 material on Jeanne Fery has already been presented in the first
 two essays of this volume, and lengthy essays analyzing the mate­
 rial on both women, along with a study of women's plots, can be
 found in volume 2.

T h e m aterial I have to give you today is so difficult th at I would
like to have had an oth er six m onths to study it b efo re I say any­
thing, for I feel th at w hat I have to say is insufficient.
   T h e re is on e authentic story th at throw s quite a revealing
light on J a n e A usten, for although she w rites w ith such appar-
ently easy m astery o f love situations, th e story goes to show th at
w hen it ca m e to h e r own affairs o f th e h eart, she was exceedingly
un certain . A gentlem an o f good ch aracter, connection, and posi-
tion in life was anxious to m arry her. She and h e r sister had com e
from B ath to stay w ith h e r b rother, who h ad su cceed ed their
fath er as R e c to r o f Steventon. W h ile they w ere at th eir b ro th ers
re c to ry som e neighbors visited w hom th ey h ad both known for a
n u m b er o f years, nam ely th e B ig g-W ith er family. O ne m orning,
th ey ap p roach ed th eir b ro th er in g re a t excitem en t and insisted on
being driven straight back to their father in Bath. L a te r it cam e
ou t th at H arris B igg-W ither had proposed to h e r and she had
accep ted , but th e next m orning she deeply re g re tte d this decision
and w ithdrew h e r accep tan ce. H e r n iece, w riting o f this incident
m any years afterw ard, said: “I g ath ered from letters th at it was
in a m om entary fit o f self-delusion th at A unt Jan e accep ted Mr.
W ith e rs proposal and th at w hen it was all settled and th e negative
decision given, she was m u ch relieved. I think th e affair vexed h er
 a good deal, but I am sure she had no attachm ent to h im .”
    R . W . C hapm an, who was th e ed ito r o f h e r collected works
 in 1 9 2 3 and who gave th e C lark lectu res on h e r life and work in
 C am bridge in 1 9 4 8 , is convinced th at both sisters shared th e sam e
 fate, th at is, they only loved once, and in both cases the m an died.

 ings and then w ithdrew into inhum an morality and retu rn ed to
 stand by h er first move. She got herself com prom ised and then
 walked out. Instead o f getting the penny o r the cake, she got
 neither. C harlotte B ron te, another parson’s daughter (about forty
 years later than Jan e A usten), also had terrible difficulties in this
 respect. She evidently fell in love with Mr. H éger, a m arried man
 in Brussels, who had a dragon o f a wife, which she described in
 h er novelVil/erte, .It is a controversial subject in B ron te literature,
 but in my opinion h er letters to him are clear.
        Like the B rontes, Jane had w ritten works as a child. She dab-
 bled in writing ju st as h er sister, Cassandra, did in drawing, their
 talents considered equal for a long tim e. H e r first truly creative
 period was from th e age o f tw enty-one to twenty-five while the
 two still lived at Steventon. D uring this period the first drafts o f
 P ride a nd P reju d ice, Sense a n d Sensibility and N o rth a n g e r A b bey
 w ere w ritten. A fterw ard th ere was a pause for nine years during
 w hich she revised and began a few books but never finished them .
 She m ade one abortive attem p t to publish N o rth a n g er A b bey
 under the title o f “Susan.” A publisher bought it for £ 1 0 .0 0 but
 n ever published it, and her b ro th er eventually bought it back
 w hen she had b ecom e famous.
    H e r fath ers retirem en t was a great relief to Jane. O n the
 o th er hand, when told that they w ere going to m ove to Bath,
 she is said to have fainted. Anything h er father did was always
 done in a great hurry with little consideration for anyone else but
 him self. Jan e seem s to have disliked Bath. T h e years th ere w ere
 clouded by C assan d ras depression over the death o f h er fiancé
 and possibly o f Jan e’s as well. H e r father died four o r five years

Jane was nearly thirty-four, M rs. A usten, h e r two daughters and
a friend, M artha, m oved in. M artha was a sister o f a sister-in-law
and eventually m arried one o f Ja n e s b rothers. Jane rem ain ed
in C haw ton for eight years, up until a few weeks p rior to h er
death, presum ably from A disons disease, w hen she was m oved to
W in ch ester for- b e tte r m edical atten tion .30 She died at th e age o f
forty-one on July 18, 1 8 1 7 . Steventon and Chaw ton w ere h e r only
two hom es, both o f w hich w ere in th e country. Mrs. A usten and
C assandra rem ained at C haw ton until th eir deaths.

have great influence on the bodys functions during physical and mental exertion. It is a

31. [Encouraged by this success, Jane Austen turned to revising “First Impressions,” that is,
Pride an d Prejudice. Her “own darling child" (as she called it) was published in January 1813.
She had already started work on Mansfield Park by 1812 and worked on it during 1813. It
was during 1813 that knowledge of her authorship started to spread outside her family. In a
letter regarding her brother, she writes: “Henry heard P. & P. warmly praised in Scotland by
Lady Robert Kerr and another Lady; what does he do in the warmth of his brotherly vanity
and love, but immediately tell them who wrote it!" Since she had sold the copyright to Pride
and Prejudice outright for £110 (presumably in order to receive a convenient pay ment up
front, rather than having to wait for the profits on sales to trickle in), she did not receive any­
thing more when a second edition was published later in 1813. A second edition of Sense and
Sensibility was also published in October 1813. In May 1814, Mansfield Park appeared and

  Stael, she declined to go.32 She was m odest about h er books and
  am azed at the am ount paid for th em , although we would think
  it very little. She thought it w onderful to get anything for things
  which cost h e r nothing. She was less m odest about h e r charac-
/ ters. She said o f Elizabeth B e n n e t in P ride a n d P rejudice that
  she thought “she was as delightful a creatu re as ev er appeared in
  prin t.” She was also fond o f "m y E lin o r” in Sense a n d Sensibility
  and alluded to E m m a as "a h eroine w hom no one b u t m yself will
  m uch like.” W h en asked if she had taken any o f h e r characters
  from life, she denied it— w hich seem s to have b een quite true.
  She w orked very m uch from reality, although she did n ot make
  actual portraits. She once said th at she was far too p rou d o f h er
  gentlem en ever to adm it that they w ere dra^wn from life! She lik-
  en ed h er books to m iniatures on "a little bit o f ivory, two inches
  wide, on which I work with as fine a brush as produces little effect

  Coppet— “the salon ofEurope”— situated beside Lake Geneva where, in palatial surround-

  Famous for attracting intellectuals, writers, and nobility, Mme de Stael’s guests gathered to
  discuss topics of current social and political interest and were entertained with music, poetry

  described as the “first female ambassador,” an unofficial title conferred upon her for her

this difficult situation as well and th en extolled th e im portance
o f being an aunt. She was always ready to help h er brothers w ith
th eir ch ild ren and was im m easurably popular with h e r nieces
and nephews. H e r niece, C aroline Austen, w rote: “I believe m y
two aunts w ere not acco u n ted as very good dressers, and w ere
thought to have taken to th e garb o f m iddle age unnecessarily
soon— but they w ere particularly neat, and th ey held all untidy
ways in great disesteem .” A nd she also w rote: “O f th e tw o, Aunt
Jane was by far m y favorite— I did not dislike A unt C assandra, but
if m y visit had at any tim e ch a n ce d to fall out during h er absence,
I don’t think I w ould have m issed her, w hereas not to have found
A unt Jane at C haw ton w ould have b e e n a blank indeed.” H e r
biographies are full o f praise from nephew s an d nieces. C aroline
said, again: “I was very fond o f her. H e r literary fam e, at th e close
o f h e r life, was only just spreading, but [h er b roth ers] w ere proud
o f h e r talents w hich they even th en estim ated highly; proud o f

o f his own to th e d ear A unt Jane w hose p e rfect equal th ey never

but she evidently had six b roth ers with tran sferen ces to her, w hich
kept h e r busy and c e n te re d on h er first family rath er than setting
out to begin h er own.
    Although h er w riting m ean t a g reat deal to h er— she called
h er books h e r children— she was inclined to put th e claim s of
life b efore h er work. In C haw ton, for instance, she had no sitting
room o f h e r own and w rote in th e dining room w here the hinges
o f t h e d oor squeaked. B u t she was m u ch opposed to th em being
rem ed ied as it gave h er w arning th at som eone was approaching
and tim e enough to hide th e pages she was working on. ( She pro-

P ride a n d P reju d ice she evidently regard ed as h er m asterpiece for
a long tim e and, in 1 8 1 3 , speaks o f th e “playfulness and epigram -
m atism o f its style,” contrasting it with th e dull books she was then
writing. I think we are justified in taking th at book as our main

 Ja n e A u sten ’s P rid e a n d P reju d ice
 Pride a n d P rejudice was first w ritten at Steventon w hen Jane
/A usten was about tw enty-tw o years old. It was at first titled
“F irst Im pressions” and was considerably revised and renam ed
before its publication during h e r earlier years at Chaw ton. Jane
“lop’t and crop ’t it,” shortening it to a length similar to Sense and
Sensibility. It is no exaggeration to say that the style is playful and
epigram m atic, and it is an exceedingly witty book.33 It begins with
the rem ark that all young single m en with good incom es are well
k no^n to be in need o f a wife and th en describes the excitem ent
in the neighborhood at th e arrival o f a young single m an supposed
to have an annual incom e o f four thousand pounds. T h e main
figures are the B ennet family. Mr. B en n et is an amusing m an who
had m arried a vulgar girl, causing considerable disappointment
and leading him later in life to b ecom e d etached and witty. The
busindss o f Mrs. B en n et’s life entails relaxing, visiting, gossiping,
and getting h er daughters m arried. O f h e r five daughters, Jane,
twenty-two years old, is exceedingly beautiful; Elizabeth, twenty,
has a lively playful disposition, witty and attractive; and Mary, a
year o r so younger, is th e plainest and, unable to com p ete with
h er older sisters, pretends to be learned. T h e two youngest sisters
have no ideas in their heads beyond th eir noses.

      Excerpt from the first pages of Pride and Prl3judice:


          It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man
      in possession o f a good fortune must be in want o f a wife.
          However little known the feelings or views o f such a man
      may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so
      well fixed in the minds o f the surrounding families, that he is
      considered as the rightful property o f some one or other o f
      their daughters.
          “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day,
       “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”
           Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
           “But it is,” re tu m ed she; ‘fo r Mrs. Long has just been
      here, and she told me all about it.”
         Mr. Bennet made no answer.
          “Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his
      wife impatiently.
           ‘You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
           This was invitation enough.
           “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that
       Netherfield is taken by a young man o f largefortune from the
       north o f England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise
       and fo u r to see the place, and was so much delighted with it
       that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take
       possession before Michael^Ms, and some ofhis servants are to
       be in the house by the end o f next week.”
            “What is his nam e?”

          “Bingley.”
          “Is he married or single?”
          “Ohl single, my dear, to be sure! A single man o f large
      fortune; fo u r or five thousand a year. What a fin e thing fo r
      our girls!”
          “How so? how can it affect them ?”
          “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be
      so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his ma^rry-
      ing one o f them.”
          “Is that his design in settling h ere?”
          “Design! nonsense, how can you talk sol But it is very
      likely that he may fall in love with one o f them, and therrefoore
      you must visit him as soon as he comes.”
          “I see no occasion fo r that. You and the girls may go, or
      you may send them by the’mselves, which perhaps will be
      still better; for, as you are as handsome as any o f them, Mr.
      Bingley might like you the best o f the party.”
          “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share
      ofbeauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary
      now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought
      to give over thinking o f her own beauty.”
          “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to
      think o f ”
          “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley
      when he comes into the neighbourhood.”                         .
         “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”
          “But consider your daughters. Only think what an estab-
      lishment it would be f o r one o f them. Sir William and Lady
      Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, fo r in
      general you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must
      go, fo r it will be impossible fo r us to visit him if you do not.”
          “You are over-scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley
      will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you
      to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which
      ever he chuses of the. girls; though I must throw in a good
      word fo r my little Lizzy.”

          “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit bet-
     ter than the others; and I am sure she is not halfso handsome
     as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia. But you are
     always giving h er the preference.”
         “They have none o f them much to recommend them ,”
     replied he; “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls;
     but Lizzy has something more o f quickness than h er sisters. ”
         “M r Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in
     such way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no com-
     passion on my poor nerves.
         ‘You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect fo r your
     nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention
     them with consideration these twenty years at least.”
          “Ah! you do not know what I suffer.”
          “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many
     young men o f fo u r thousand a year co^me into the neighbour-
     hood.”
         “It will be no use to us i f twenty such should come, since
     you will not visit them .”
        “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I
     will visit them all. ”
        Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture o f quick parts, sarcastic
     humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience o f three and
     twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife under­
     stand his character.. H er m ind was less difficult to develope.
     She was a woman o f mean understanding, little info^nation,
     and uncertain tem per When she was discontented she fan-
      cied herself nervous. The business o f h er life was to get h er
     daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.

   A t th e beginning o f the work th ere is an amusing description
o f th e N eth erfield ball at M eryton during w hich th e m en o f the
book are introduced. C harles Bingley, tw enty-tw o, com es to the
ball and turns out to be an extraverted young m an, handsom e and
delightful to everybody. H e is accom p an ied by F i t ^ i l l i a m D arcy,
tw enty-eight (known in th e book simply as D arcy), tall in person,
  1.88         The Animus: The Spirit of Inner Truth in Women



 handsom e and noble in m ien (yet notoriously proud). W ithin five
 m inutes after his en tran ce the w ord is about that he has an annual
 incom e o f ten thousand pounds. As cold as he is proud, he refuses
 to dance with anybody at the ball.
     Charles Bingley is bedazzled by Jan e and tries to persuade
/ D arcy to dance with Elizabeth. B u t D arcy looks at her, finds h er
 m erely tolerable in com parison to h e r sister, and declares that
 she is not attractive enough to tem p t him, adding th at he cer-
 tainly is not in the h u m or to dance with a lady already slighted by
 an oth er man. Elizab eth is am used b u t angry. She thinks him most
 disagreeable and is quite ready to believe the lies told o f him by
 G eorge W ickham (the son o f Old W ickham , the form er steward
 to the eld er and d eceased Mr. D arcy Senior o f Pem berley). In
 fact, everybody in the M eryton neighborhood is pleased to think
 how m uch they had always disliked Mr. D arcy b efore they had
 known anything about him. W h ereas E lizabeth finds him to be
 the only m an at the ball lacking a single admirable feature, D arcy
 will soon begin to fall in love with h er. L a te r in the story, D arcy
 confesses how his love fo r h e r ha)> overcom e his sense that a mar-
 riage to h er— due to h er inferior family— would be degrading.
 His arrogance inflames Elizabeth, w ho curtly rejects his pro-
 posal: h ere h e r p rid e and his p reju d ice. W h en D arcy notices that
 Bingley is falling in love with Jan e, he thinks it wise to rem ove him
 and whisks him off the day after the ball. Jane is left badly hurt
 b u t shows nothing o f it.
      T h e R everen d W illiam Collins, tw enty-five years old, R e cto r
 of H unsford in K en t, cousin and h eir to Mr. B en n et, visits the
 Longbourne estate o f th e B en n et family. H e proposes marriage
 to his cousin Elizabeth after being denied his wish to m arry
 Jan e (since, according to h e r m other, she is already practically
 engaged). In one o f the m ost amusing scenes in English litera­
 tu re, he proposes to Elizabeth who answers him in the negative.
 Since he has m ore m oney than she does and will inherit the very
 estate, he can ’t conceive o f any grounds why she should reject
 him and thus persistently disbelieves h e r refusal, imagining h er
 rep eated denials as coquetry. C harlotte L ucas, a close friend of

Elizab eth and a realistic girl, helps “Lizzy” get over the difficulty
w ith Collins. M arriage, she say, is a lottery, and at tw enty-seven
it w ould b e ju st as well to be m arried, and Collins is not any sil-
lier than anyone else, so she decides to m arry him herself, m uch
to E lizab eth s am azem en t th at a m an should propose to two girls
within th e space o f th ree days.
    Jan e B en n et, still unhappy, spends m ost o f the w inter in
Lon d on while E lizabeth goes to stay in K en t w ith C h arlotte
L u cas, now wife o f the R everen d Collins. T h e patron o f the
Collins family, L ad y C ath erin e de B ourgh (D a rcy s glacial aunt),
now com es to stay. Elizab eth is furious with D arcy 'because she is
con vin ced that he is the source o f Ja n e ’s despair, seeing as it was
he w ho whisked C harles Bingley away from h e r sister. A nger and
the prejudice induced by W ickham prevents h e r from realizing
th at D arcy is in love with her. D a rcy s ensuing proposal affords a
wonderful scene in w hich h e speaks o f love b u t also to an equal
exten t o f the inferiority o f h e r background and connections. H e
goes on for quite a while and evidently has no doubt w hatsoever
th at she was waiting to catch him. She refuses him , and w hen he
presses for a reason, she says th a t she co u ld n ot love a m an who
has ru in ed the happiness o f h e r sister and tre a te d Mr. W ickham
so atrociously. Elizabeth says straight out th at his offer could not
have been m ade to h e r in any form in w hich she could have been
even tem p ted to a cce p t it.
   T h e next day, he gives h e r a letter in w hich he m akes it clear
that she was m isinform ed as to his behavior tow ard W ickham .
Elizab eth also has the honesty to see that h e could not have
noticed how m uch in love Jan e was with C harles Bingley because
Jan e had b een so reticen t in showing h e r feelings. She feels nei­
th er friendly nor any re g re t for having refu sed him , but she slowly
realizes that she has been a bit unjust.
   E lizab eth s aunt and uncle then take h e r to P em b erley to visit
D arcy ’s estate. She can find no way out o f accom panying them but
finds ou t from a maid in advance that the family is away. As the
entourage approaches the grounds they m eet D arcy com ing out
o f the stables and, to E lizab eth s am azem ent, she notices that she
 190             The Animus: The Spirit of Inner Truth in Women



 finds him quite am enable. H e asks h er uncle to join him fishing
 and brings his young sister to call on her, relating to Elizabeth
 that he has truly no hard feelings about the past. B ut everything
  erupts sky high when they discover that Lydia— h er own youngest
  sister— has now run away with G eorge W ickham .
/     Elizabeth notices for the first tim e that perhaps she would
 have liked to have a ccep ted D arcy ’s proposal after all, but thinks it
 now hopeless. She then discovers that D arcy has swiftly pursued
 W ickham and bribed him to m arry Lydia. L a te r D arcy com es to
 see the Bennets with Bingley, who he now encourages to m arry
 Jane. And he, in turn, proposes to E lizabeth again, the book end-
 ing with th ree daughters m arried and Mrs. B en n et quite accom -
 plished in the business o f h e r life.
     Jane Austen seem s to have lived in a kind o f active im agn ation
_in h er books. She could usually tell h er family exactly what hap-
 p en ed to h er characters even beyond the beginnings and endings
 o f h er stories, although, in the books them selves, none o f this
 inform ation appears. W ithin the fram ew ork Qf the_characte.rsLÍn
 Pri.cl<raná P rejudice, for instance, she later narrated th at.th eJw o
 younger B ennet girls m arried: Kitry, was b e tr o th e d to . a. pa:t:son
 near Pem berley, while M ay)/was. satisfied w ith a .solicitors clerk,
he being the largest toad in a small pond. In London, Jan e Austen
w rites that she found a portrait o f Jane Bingley and thus she now
 knows exactly what she looked like, but continues that she was not
 fortunate enough to find a portrait o f D arcy and thus supposes
 that he did not want the eyes o f th e m ultitude to look upon him
 o r his beloved. Apparently h er fictitious characters w ere quite
 real for her.
    Turning now ..to our discussion, I w ould first like to consider
 the animus as he appears in this particular story. S om eon e noted
 last w eek that D arcy seem s to be an animus and not a hufl).an
 figure. D arcy lacks the clivi,ne o r dem onic qualities o f Heathdiff.
 in W u thering H eights, for instance, but at bottom he is a wishful
 filntasy figure.. H e lacks m asculine pursuits or interests. N one o f
 th e th re e m ain m ale figures have any profession. Darcy, it is true,
 is spoken o f as a good landlord, so presum ably he looks after his

estate; b u t th e P em b erley estate has an agent, so th at w ork can n ot
b e all too strenuous. Jan e A usten said th at she n ever knew w hat
m en talked about w hen th ey w ere alone am ong them selves, so
she n ever le t th e m do this in h e r books in case she m ade mistakes.

Think o f w hat w e know about his m other: she was the sister of
L ad y C ath erin e de Bourgh, who is adm ittedly haughty. Talking
about his parents, D arcy says th at th ey had good principies, but
he only really praises his father. W e know little about his m other,
but w hat we do know shows th at she resem bled h e r sister, and she
w ould probably have criticized Elizab eth m uch as L ady O atherine
does. B u t this does not happen after th e first few days.
   Som eone rem ark ed th at Jane A usten’s books m ust have b een
a substitute for th e life she could not live owing to h e r father
com plex, and in spite o f h e r m any attractions, she could not get
out into life itself. U ndoubtedly th e re is tru th in this. I had a great
deal o f difficulty with D arcy w hen I was eighteen years old. H e
had an outright pernicious effect on m e: I u sed to com p are every
young m an I m et to him and o f co u rse they n ever passed the test!
How ever, I got an inferiority com p lex from com paring m yself
with Elizab eth . E ven von F ra n z said rath er wistfully th at D arcy
was sympathetically m asculine in his way o f courting Elizabeth
but added that he rem inded h e r of the divine figure o f W och p e,
 the beautiful one, whom Paul Radin told us about.35 T h e Indian

    This is realistic and m uch m ore in accord an ce with th e facts.

She is th e one w ho ought to be able to see how the relationship
works, and, in my opinion, Jan e A ustens wishful fantasy did a

.Lo,gOS_When I first read P ride a n d P rejudice, it was a trem endous
relief to m e. I thought th at it was w onderful th at m en w ere really
like this. T h e only oth er tim e I had this feeling was in Tunis. I
had b een having a particularly difficult tim e in Paris, and w hen I
woke up in th e morning in Tunis, it was as if everything had been
set right, everything seem ed to co m e together, nothing could fall
ap art again, and that feeling en d u red throughout my six m onths’
stay in N orth Africa. I did not understand it at all until I heard
Jung say th a t th e M oham m edan tradition is based on E ro s, unlike
th e Christian tradition w hich is based on Logos.
   In answ er to a question, som eone pointed o u t th at M rs. B en n et
probably typified Jan e A ustens relationship with h e r m other. W e
m ay have a point h ere, b u t m ore likely it typifies an unconscious
figure within her. O th er m o th er figures w ould have to be taken
into account, such as M rs. D ashw ood in Sense a n d Sensibility
and M rs. M orland in N o rth a n g er A b b ey . I doubt if Jan e A usten’s
m o th e r was as efficient as Mrs. B en n et. I f so, it would be rath er
rem arkable th at both h e r daughters rem ain ed unm arried. To put
it unkindly, Jan e A usten’s books consist o f visits and gossip. It is
a pure w om ans world o f that tim e. In Pride a nd P rejudice, with
 194           The Animus: The Spirit of Inner Truth in Women



 all h er vulgarity, the person w ho really achieves h e r objective is
 M rs. B en n et. I am quite sure th at Jan e A usten did n ot realize how
 m u ch h er b eloved E lizabeth ow ed to h e r vulgar, silly m oth er. W e
 are told that she had b een m ore beautiful than all h e r daughters
 and that otherw ise she had b een like Lydia. T h at is, subtract-
/in g the vulgarity and silliness, an instinctive w om an knowing
 the pig in h erself without the im peding influence o f good man-
 ners and decency. Jung said to m e that w hat was really n eed ed
 in these days is indubitably d e ce n t w om en who also a cce p t the
 pig in them selves. M rs. B e n n e t was not so very d ecen t, but she
 had accep ted the pig. H e re w e should re m e m b e r the R egency
 period o ccu rred prior to the V ictorian E ra . Jan e A usten w rote
 in the reign o f G eorge II I and his R eg en t son w hen m orals w ere
 by no m eans so very strict. W e have always had dreadfully strict
 tim es like the Victorians and free tim es like the R egency, but the
 English always have a peculiar attitude to the body. Bryant, in
 “English Saga,” quotes R og et’s T hesaurus, which cam e ou t about
the sam e tim e as Jane A u sten s works: everything is catalogued in
it excep t the parts o f the body; you can find only “sto m ach ” und er
 “recep tacle” and “genitals” u n d er “p rod u ction.”
    Elizabeth n eed ed this vulgar e arth m oth er and h e r impossible
Lydia shadow to attract D arcy at all, although I doubt if Jane
A usten was at all conscious o f this fact. And this brings us to a
 m uch discussed point in Jan e Austen, nam ely h e ra ttitu d e t^ vard _
_passion._ It only actually appears in Lydia B en n et and M aria
 Rushw orth in M ansfield Park, two definitive shadow figures. B u t
 it is m erely nam ed in D a rcy s le tte r to Elizabeth: he sru.d that it
 required the utm ost forces o f passion to make him p u t aside his
 objection to h er family and inferior social status. Undoubtedly,
we m ust not forget that Jan e Austen was a fath ers daughter and,
w orse still, a parson’s child. I do not im agine that M rs. Austen,
although she was well con n ected , was an attractive woman.
Probably m ost o f Mr. A usten s anim a was p rojected onto Jane,
for C assandra did m anage to g et h erself engaged. I f Jan e had
been able to g et o u t o f h e r fath er com plex, she might have had to
com e in on Lydia’s level, w here she might then have gotten the
              Animus Figures in Literature and in Modern Life                  1.95



thing straight, for she could not possibly have started on th e truly
high level w here she puts Elizabeth. Naturally, she was unable to
a cce p t h er Lydia shadow, so she just rep ressed the whole thing.
C h arlotte B ron te goes into passion m uch m ore in h e r books,
som etim es a little farth er than one feels she knows w hat she is
talking about. B u t she h ad a m uch wilder tem p eram en t— and .less
cu ltu re— than Jane Austen. Old Mr. B ron te was a farm er’s son, so
it is likely th at she was naturally m u ch clo se r to the earth.
     I think we can see v ery w ell in P ride a n d P rejudice how it
req u ired th e vulgarity o f Lydia B en n et for Ja n e A usten e v e r to
have let h erse lf go. T h e E nglish g en tlem en ideal is responsible for
an incredible state o f things, underneath o f w hich vulgarity is the
least. 1l'- "a turallyJ:heuabsence„Q f sexu.ality a n d .p a s s io n o n -h e . one

little niore than this: th at she was not a poet.
    I w ould like ju st to say a few words m ore about P ride a nd
P rejud ice b efore w e pass on to Persuasion. Speaking o f h e r books
as a whole, C hapm an notes th at h er creative imagination w orked
m ost freely within a fram ew ork fixed for h e r by small points of
co n ta ct with reality. It is as though she had m ade a very small
fram e in P ride a n d P rejudice and refused to allow anything
fantastic to enter. W ithin that fram e, how ever, h e r spiritus re c ­
to r takes a pretty free hand, at all events in h e r early books, and
produces such a pair as D arcy and E lizabeth. ,l£one~really_thinks

an old maid in all o f h e r novels, nam ely Ms. B ates in E m m a . Jane
A usten seem s to be a g reat m atchm aker and m arries off all h er
ch aracters, and h e r h eroes and heroines usually seem to have a
reasonably good ch an ce o f making a good job o f it. B u t it is strik-
ing that the actual m arried pairs in h e r books are as a rule by no
;ta e a n s happy, and this with few exceptions such as th e G ardeners
in P ride a n d Prejudice.

Ja n e A u sten ’s Persuasion
M ost o f Jan e A usten’s books have th e sam e plot. T h e village, one
family and th eir f riends, th e arrival o f interlopers who do or do
not m arry into th e family, and about th ree weddings at the end.
T h ere are two villages in Persuasion, the first being Som erset.
T h ere is a silly b aronet: Sir W alter Elliot o f Kellynch Hall. His
wife was a charm ing and intelligent w om an, and we are told that
if we forgive h e r youthful folly in marrying Sir W alter, w e shall not
have to forgive h e r anything else. She dies, how ever, before the
story has begun, leaving behind th ree daughters. It is th e middle
daughter, A nne, who is th e heroine. She resem bles th e m other,
and the shadow is again carried by th e sisters, seen in the eldest
daughter Elizabeth, who is handsom e, haughty, and otherwise
like h er father, and th e youngest, Mary, who is m arried, silly, and
selfish. T h e extravagance o f Sir W alter and his daughter Elizabeth
make it necessary to lease th eir h om e, Kellynch Hall, to Admiral
C roft. W e then learn that eight years ago Anne, as a pretty girl o f
n in eteen , had been engaged to th e b ro th er o f M rs. C roft. Anne
had allowed h erself to be persuaded that the m atch was im pru-
dent: W entw orth C roft— although a prom ising young officer in
the navy— had not yet m ade a c a re e r and his family cam e from
a class lower than th e E lliot’s. W entw orth, who was furious when
A nne failed to stand by h e r love for him , left England, m ade good
in his profession, and is now on leave, a naval captain and a rich
man. Anne has by no m eans forgotten him and is m uch agitated
at th e thought o f m eeting him again. W hen his brother-in-law
takes Kellynch Hall, she at first avoids m eeting him and then has
th e m ortification o f hearing that he would not have known h er

and realizes th at she will probably have to see him m arry som e-
one else, nam ely one o f h e r brother-in-law s sisters. T h e way she
accep ts h e r suffering is w ell d escrib ed . L a te r they all go off to
L ym e Regis w here a gentlem an— looking invigorated by the sea
breezes— notices A nne and regard s h e r w ith g reat adm iration.
C aptain W entw orth notices this exchange betw een A nne and the
gentlem an, and his old feelings for h e r are on ce again aroused.
B u t this tim e, he is in a different situation: th e girl he has b een
flirting with has had an accid en t in L ym e Regis, and W entw orth
realizes th a t he is regard ed as being practically engaged to her.
Anne suffers even m ore this tim e as she loses W entw orth again.
L ater, in B ath , she m eets W illiam E lliot, h e r fath ers heir, and
recognizes him as th e adm iring gentlem an o f Lym e R egis. His
adm iration in creases and w hen C aptain W entw orth— now freed
by th e girls en gag em en t to an oth er naval m an— com es to Bath,
he finds everyone expecting A nne’s en g agem en t to W illiam Elliot.
A nne, however, still loves C aptain W en tw orth but has to give him
a lot o f help before he dares to propose. T h e book ends, as usual,
with th ree weddings.                                                                  j

 Psychologically considered, Persuasion represents a notable vic-
 tory over Jane A ustens earlier books, but it is not at all as inter-
 esting as P ride a n d P rejudice. Virginia W oolf says that she finds a
 peculiar beauty, as well as g reat dullness, in Persuasion.
     W e m ust really ask ourselves why Jane A ustens books are clas-

Burney, Maria Edgew orth, and Ann Radcliffe.38 Jane Austen
depicts a woman’s world o f gossip but, in h e r early books, a world
seen through the eyes o f th e animus. As I see it, she m ade an
attem p t to put h er animus in the resin thus partially humanizing
this w om ans world. She narrow ed h er field to very small dim en-
sions on h er “little bit o f ivory.” She threw out everything not in
h e r im m ediate experience. This included vital parts o f the whole
hum an being such as passions, sexuality, poetry, and mysticism.

ground and subordinate figures are com pletely realistic from the
beginning, and this realism advances closer to the main figures in
each book until som ething like a victory isjobtained in Persuasion,
which was h er final book published in the year o f h e r death. But
the playfulness that makes P ride a n d Prejudice so delightful is
largely in abeyance, and M rs. B en n ets business in life still has
the upper hand.
    Jung once m ade the observation in a seminar that people who
have managed to get an objective attitude to the things that still
possess and worry them have th e greatest fascination, and it is in
my opinion that Jane A ustens fascination is due to a certain extent
to th e fact that she was able to overcom e something, even if but a
small aspect o f the animus, by which everyone else was still com ­
pletely possessed. The animus, speaking from the standpoint of
happiness, may have su cceed ed in ruining h er life, but w e should
probably never have heard o f Jane Austen had she su cceed ed

    her, for although w e are u ncertain o f the cause o f h e r death, the
    symptoms described may. have arisen in part from psychological
    conditions; in any case, she certainly died young.
I      Jane Austen was a true child o f h er times and pursued the ten-
    dency o f her age, w hich was “reality at all costs.” It was the tim e
    when science was beginning to develop and w hen alchem y had
    already split into two parts, chem istry and mysticism. She only
    saw the one side o f w om ans problem with h er creative mind and
    fought fantastic illusion with all h er might. She did n ot see that
    there was also a value in th e very fantasy that she was opposing.
    It is no w onder that C harlotte B ron te is the one em inent nine-
    teen th -cen tury author w ho rejects Jane Austen, for the Brontes
    w ere mainly con cern ed with th e oth er side o f the creative spirit,
    the side which Jane Austen opposed.
          In the age in which she lived, it m ust have required an enor-
    mous self-discipline and self-denial to give up wishful think-
    ing to the extent sh o^ n in the difference betw een D arcy and
    W entw orth. T herefore I think the im portance o f h er admittedly
    one-sided contribution can hardly be exaggerated. One might
    say th at she cleaned the mind o f one wom an (her own) to a great
    exten t o f superfluities, and she brought a certain “scientific con-
    science” into w om ans w ork for the first tim e that I know of. You

thing I had b e e n trying to see, namely, what h e r animus had done
to h er books. H e seem s to have narrow ed the field to such an
exten t as to alm ost exclude th e unconscious altogether. H e focused
h e r eyes to such a d egree on everyday experience as to m ake it
easy for him to insert figures su ch as D a rcy and Elizabeth— ani­

   A w om an’s writing is, to som e extent, a “having it out” with h er
animus, or in m ore ordinary language, h e r creative spirit. That is,
“h e ” puts th e ideas into h er head and she accepts or rejects them .
A nd if she rejects them , he m ay likely resort to cheating h e r on a
 small or, som etim es, on a grand scale. Look ed at from this point of
 view, as Jung has said, th e animus or anim a approaches a person,
 as a rule, for one o f two purposes: to bring som ething up from the
 unconscious o r to learn som ething from us about the outer world
 o r consciousness.
     W e m ight therefore venture the hypothesis that Jane A usten’s
 creative spirit (that is, h er animus) was m ore interested in learning
 about h er world than he was in bringing h e r the w ider treasures
 o f th e unconscious, and in ord er to do this, he narrow ed the field
 m uch as w e also try to do in an effort to grasp som ething o f the
 invisible world o f th e unconscious. T he departure from hum an
 reality, such as w e found in th e figures o f D arcy and Elizabeth,
 would then, as it w ere, be accounted for by the animus’s difficulty

 in seeing our reality. The gradual humanizing of hero and heroine

  Mary Gladys M eredith was born at Leighton, Shropshire (near the
 center of Great Britain not far from the border of W ales), on 25
  M arch 1881. George Edw ard M eredith, her father, was a country
  gentleman, nature enthusiast, poet, painter, and a tutor proud of
 his W elsh-Celtic heritage. Marys mother, Sarah Alice, was the only
 child o f W alter Scott, a rich Edinburgh surgeon (of the family of
 his famous namesake). Mary was the first child o f George Edward
 and Sarah Alice and the eldest by six years of the other Meredith
 children (two sisters and three brothers). It was at her childhood
 home, the Grange, where her f a th e d a n Oxford M.A.) expanded

 included Shakespeare, Milton, the Rom antic poets, the Brontes,
  and many other works of English and classical literature. H er deep
 bond with the Shropshire countryside, seen in some o fh e r earliest
 poems, was a molding influence on her mind and spirit.39
    Like Emily Bronte, who would never go away from the moors,
 she always pined for Shropshire. She is another of these fathers
 daughters. But such father-daughter relationships seem abso-
 lutely necessary seeing as there are apparently no wom en authors
 who are not. She describes her father in the person of John Arden

because her father w rote poem s, and M ary copied everything he

for its wild and picturesque landscapes, its hill ranges, pine forests, small pastoral valleys
in the south, sweeping agricultural plains in the north, and numerous significant historical,
geographical, and geological landmarks. The Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural
Beauty covers about a quarter of the county. It is one of Englands most rural and sparsely
populated counties. Mary Webb’s cottage was outside of the village of Bayston Hill, a few
miles south of Shrewsbury. Ed.]

she herself died o f undernourishment. She and h er husband
literally lived on bread and scrape. She would complain that her
publishers did not pay h er sufficiently for h er writings, but this
was incorrect. She would go to a farm house and ask what the
people there would like for Christm as and then buy them a piano.
,Mfhen she went to London, she purportedly thought she could be
o f some help to all of the poor people there. At the end of her
novel G one to E arth is a description o f Hazel W oodus’s devotion
to a fox. She worships the animal, and although she m arries and
has a lover as well, nobod y approaches the place in h er heart held
by the smooth white personality o f Foxy. (She does, however, set
the animal out into nature and its fate.) T he book concludes with
unbearable tensions betw een H azel, h er husband, and h er lover
and the approaching hounds o f the fox hunt. Foxy com es to her
in the woods, she picks him up and flees, but she cannot run fast
enough to get hom e. Everyone yells to h er to put the fox down,
but she imagines the animal caught by the hounds and th e hunts-
man, knows how it will shriek in suffering, imagines the look in
the anim als eyes, and cannot b ear the agony o f its impending
death. Thus she flees on foot and accidentally plum m ets into an
abandoned mine shaft to h er death— with Foxy in h er arms.
   Anyone who has had a pet can understand her feelings. B ut if
one cannot face the facts o f nature and life, then one is not quite
capable of living. One has not enough instinct for self-preserva-
tion, and evidently that was lacking in M ary W ebb. B ecause she
could not face the eyes o f the beggars with their look of reproach
and suffering, she preferred to give everything away. Suffering
from Graves disease, an illness in which the sufferer requires
good nutrition and which today is fully treatable (but not curable),
she in essence starved herself to death. After a dream o fm y a w n ,

206            The Animus: The Spirit of Inner Truth in Wo men



      Excerpt from the first pages of Mary Webb’s Precious Bane:

          It was at a love-spinning that I saw Kester firs t. And if,
      in these new fangled days, when strange inventions crowd
      upon us, when I hear tell there is even a m achine coming into
f     use in some parts o f the country fo r reaping and mowing, if
      those that mayhappen w ill read this d ont know w hat a love-
      spinning was, they shall hear in good time . . . .
          Kester says that a ll tales, true tales, or romancings, go
      farth er back than the days o f the child; aye, farth e r even than
      the little babe in its cot o f rushes. Maybe you never slept in a
      cot of rushes; but a ll o f us did at Sam . There is such a plenty
      o f rushes at Sam , and old Beguildy’s Missus was a great one
      fo r plaiting them on rounded barrel-hoops. Then they’d be set
      on rockers, and a nice clean cradle they made, soft and green,
      so that the babe could fee l as big-sorted as a little Caterpillar
      (painted butterflies-as-is-to-be, Kester calls them ) sleeping in
      its cocoon. Resters very set about such things. N ever w ill he
      say caterpillars. H e íl say, ‘There’s a lpt o f butter-flies-as-is-
      to-be on our cabbages, Prue.’ He w on t say l t ’s w inter.’ H e’ll
      say, ‘Sum m ers sleeping.’ And there's no bud little enough nor
      sad-coloured enoughfo r Kester not to callen it the beginnings
      of the blow [blossoming].
          But the time is not yet come fo r speaking o f Kester. It is
      the story o f us a ll at Sam , o f M other and Gideon and me, and
      Jan cis (that was so beautiful), and W izard Beguildy, and the
      two or three otherfo lk that lived in those parts,. that I did set
      out to tell. There were but a few , and maybe alw ays w ill be,
      fo r there’s a discouragement about the place. It may be the
      w ater lapping, year in and year out— everywhere you look
      and listen, w ater; o r the big trees w aiting and considering on
      your right hand and on your left; or the unbreathing quiet of
      the place, as if it was created but an hour gone, and not creat-
      ed fo r us. O r it m ay be that the soil is very poor and m arshy,
      w ith little nature or goodness in the grass, w hich is ever so

    paigle. Happen you call it cowslip, but we alw ays named it
    the paigle, o r keys o f heaven. It was a w onderful thing to see
    our meadows at Sarn when the cow slip was in blow. Gold-
    over they were, so that you w ould think not even an angels
    fee t were good enough to w alk there. You could make a tossy-
    b all before a thrush had gone over his song tw ice, fo r yo u d
    only got to sit down and gather w ith both hands. Eve ry w ay
    you looked there was naught but gold, saving towards Sarn,
    where the woods began, and the great str etch o f grey water,
    gleam ing and w incing in the sun. N either woods nor w ater
    looked darksome in th at fin e spring weather, w ith the leaves
    com ing new, and buds the colour o f corn in the b irch-tops.
     O nly in our oak wood there was alw ays a look o fthe back-end
     o f the year, th eir young leaves being so brown. So there was
     alw ays a breath o f October in our M ay. Bu t it was a pleasant
     thing to sit in the meadows and look aw ay to the fa r hills. The
     larches spired up in th e ir quick green, and the cowslip gold
     seemed to get into you r heart, and even Sarn M ere was noth­
     ing but a blue m ist in a yellow m ist o f birch-tops. And there
    was such a dream on the place that if a w ild bee came by, let
     alone a bumble, it startled you like a shout. I f a bee comes in
     at the w indow now to m y ja r o f gillyflow ers, I can see it a ll in
     clear colours, w ith Plash lyin g under the sunset, beyond the
     woods, looking like a jagged piece o f bottle glass. Plash M ere
     was bigger than Sarn, and there w asnt a tree by it, so where
     there w ere no h ills beyond it you could see the clouds rooted
     in it on the fa r side, and I used to think they looked like the
     w hite w ater-lilies that lay round the m argins o f Sarn h alfth e
     sum m er through. There was nothing about Plash that was
     differen t from any other lake or pool. There was no troubling
     o f the w aters, as at Sarn, nor any village sounding its bells
     beneath the furth est deeps. It was true, w hat folks said o f
     Sarn, that there was summat to be fe lt there.


   P recious B a n e is about a family o f small yeom an farmers—
sturd y honest, and trustworthy, the salt of the earth. The village
 208               The Animus: The Spirit of Inner Truth in Women



 of Sam M ere, with the small farmhouse o f Prudence Sam , seems
 to have been a terribly gloomy place. There was always a hint of
 autumn even in the heart o f spring. There was “a discouragement
 about the place” as Prudence, the narrator, says. (Stanley Baldwin,
 one o f Mary W ebb’s admirers, wrote a warm appreciation of her
jin the preface to Precious B ane. H e says that the strength o f the
 book lies in the fusion o f the elem ents o f nature and man, as
 observed in this rem ote countryside by a woman even m ore alive
 to the changing moods o f nature than o f man.) There had been
 something queer about the family ever since Timothy Sam was
 struck by “forkit lightning.” Timothy w ent against his folk and the
 counsels o f a man o f God and took up with the wrong side— we
 are not told what that meant— and so he was struck by lightning.
 H e was counseled by the man o f God to espouse the safe side
 and avoid lightning, but he kept to his side, and as he was com-
 ing hom e under the oak wood, he was struck again. And that all
 occurred a century or two before the beginning o f the story. The
 lightning then seemingly got into his blood and the Sam family
 was said to have had the lightning in their blood ever since.
    The fact that the family has this quality is important. The
 second picture in “A Study in the Process of Individuation”
 shows where the lightning detaches the round stone. Jung cites
 numerous examples o f symbolic references to lightning and notes
 that lightning signifies a sudden, unexpected, and overwhelming
 change in psychic condition.42 (This reference is to this particular
 case, since here lightning dislodges and detaches the round stone
 making individuation possible.) Jung then quotes Jakob Boehm e
 who evidently regarded lightning as something very dangerous,
 for in one place he likens it to a “furious serpent that rages and
 raves as if it wanted to split up nature,” but in another place he
 also says that “in the spirit of lighting there is a great almighty life”
 and that out of lightning arises the birth o f light and the light of
 majesty.43 Boehm e adds that although he sees and knows lightning

 well, if he could but com prehend it in the flesh of his o ^ n body
 then he would be transfigured and his body would no longer
 resem ble the animal body but that o f an angel of God. St. Paul
 also experienced the blinding flash of light from Heaven. Perhaps
 that is sufficient to show us that the Sam family had something
 in their blood that called them to individuation. If they carried
 lightning in their blood and did not turn around their lives, as
 their ancestor Tim othy S am would not, it might well work itself
 out as described in the book, as a sort of curse on land and family.
 At all events, it would rem ain a curse until som eone could accept
 it and thus give a chance to th e m ore positive possibilities that

    On the evening when th e story begins, the parents had been
 busy with a b ee swarm and the children had been sent to church.
 They only had church once a m onth, so their parents had been
 extrem ely firm about attendance. But instead o f going to church,
 the two took a “dog's leave.” W hen they retu m ed hom e and were

 W hen they arrive, the old custom o f sin eating was supposed to
 take place. In those days th ere was always a sin eater who took
 on th e job o f “eating” all the sins o f the dead.44 B ut sin eaters
 44. [A sin eater was a man who took upon himself the sins of a deceased person. In England,
 generally each village had its official sin eater to whom notice was given as soon as a death
 occurred. He immediately went to the deceased’s house, sat down in the vicinity of the death
 chamber, and was given a crust of bread and portion of ale which he ate and drank. When

here asked a large sum, and Gideon was too cheap to pay it. So
Gideon says th a th e will take on the burden o f his fathers sin if
 his m other win give him the farm an d give up all o f her rights to
Ít..P ru e narrates: “Gideon was very like father then, and m ore like
 him every year, both to look at him and in his mind. Saving that
/le was less tem persom e and m ore set in his ways, he was fathers
 very marrow.” This extraordinary likeness presumably indicates
that Gideon, if we take him as P ru e’s animus (which w e will be
justified in doing), will represent the brothers aspect o f the ani­
mus— and to a great extent that o f her father as well— so we may
expect a powerful figure. The sin eater has to eat a small crust and
drink a glass o f wine or ale on the coffin and say: “I give easem ent
and rest now to thee, dear man, that ye walk not over the fields
nor down the by-ways. And for thy peace I pawn my own soul.”
Gideon changed this slightly and said: “C om e not down the lanes
nor in our meadows,” and Prue said it was like somebody warning
off a trespasser. Presumably this old rite was a rem nant o f one of
the numberless old primitive rites intended to prevent the dead
from walking about a^night. But it goes a bit further to p a^ n one’s
soul, not that would be the first tim e for Gideon who did it as a
boy o f seven when they w ere beaten once m uch earlier for taking
a “dog’s leave” from church. Gideon had said then: “I do will and
wish to be a M aister Beguildy’s son and the devil shall have my
soul.” (Maister Beguildy was the local sorcerer.) Thus as_a boy.of
seven he had called upon the devil,„establishing, adink betw een
the personal side and the arch e^ p al devil. This soul, a.s_we_shall

and then get rid o f the old place, w hereas Prue is traditional and
wants to keep it. Von Fran z gave the following example o f the
natural mind: a couple was taking a walk along a lovely country
road and the woman says something like: “Oh darling, what won-
derful country. I f one o f us dies I shall com e and live h ere!” In
!fly paper on The Evil Vineyard, I try to show how unconscious
Mary, the protagonist o f the story, was o f h er goal.46 H ere we have
a m ore conscious situation. Prue is closer to h e r m ^ c u li1 1 it:y jh j
Mary. She becom es aware o f th e goal h ere, that is, it enters h er
cgnsçiousRess ....She cloes nqtJtfi.rsta.gJ:§e. It is just as though such
an idea com es up in our heads and we push it back, realizing that
it is not really what we want.
     B ut then Gideon gets at h er on h er most vulnerable point.
H e plays another animus trick and brings to her consciousness
a thing she has always known but not realized, namely, that she
has a hare lip. Gideon says: “Being as how things are, you’ll never
marry, Prue.” She rejects him, answering: “N ot wed, G ideon? Oh,
ah! r l l wed for sure.” But he has fully underm ined h er instinctual
reaction and wounded h er deeply in her self-worth.                  |
      In local superstition, a hare lip is regarded as the devil’s mark
and the infallible sign o f a witch. It was supposed to b e caused
by a hare crossing the path o f a pregnant woman. O r a bad fright
was also thought to cause a w om an to have a child with a hare lip.
W henever Prue's m other looked at her, she said, “C an I help it
that a hare crossed my path?” But Prue had not realized the.impli-
cation before, and Gideon’s com m ent no doubt convinced her
that no one would m arry a “hare schotten” girl. Psychologically,
the hare lip would imply something extrem ely primitive in her
makeup. Jung says that in schizophrenic conditions th ere is usu­
ally a piece o f the most extraordinary archaic primitiveness which
the person has failed to integrate, a piece that all but refuses to
be integrated. There would clearly be such a piece in a family like
the Sams who have lightning in their blood. But the question is:
can it be integrated? And a partial answer to this question we will

said that she would do as he wanted. But he m ade her swear on
the family Bible so that she shouldn’t think better o f it afterward.
She has to say: “I promise and vow to obey my brother, Gideon
Sam , and to hire myself out to him as a sarvant, for no money,
until all that he will be done. And I’ll be biddable as a prentice, a
^ ife , and a dog. I swear it on the Holy Bible. Am en.” "So I said
it,” she adds, and then Gideon said: “I swear to keep faith with my
sister, Prue Sam , and share all with her when we’ve won through,
and give her money up to fifty pound when w e’ve sold Sam, to
cure her. A m en.” She concludes that after he’d done it, she felt

exam ple o f a girl who I knew when I was young and who I have
kept up with throughout ou r lives. She was m uch like Prue; the
one aim o f h e r life, the one thing she w anted, was a husband and
a child. She fell in love at seventeen with a m an of w hom her
parents disapproved, as he was socially not quite up to h er level.
W h en she cam e hom e, she found that h er parents had a plan to
m arry h er to a duke. Naturally, she failed in h er objective for her
h eart was untouched, and fortunately the duke was not such a
fool as to be deceived. T h e plebian lover was also disgusted and
th en m arried in his own class. She reacted by rejecting society
and insisting on going to Cam bridge, for which she had no real
bent. Going to Cam bridge m eant a terrific fight in those days,
but she m anaged it with an energy worthy of a b etter cause. phe
thus th rew over h er own principle o f E ro s, and h er right to live
as a woman, and plunked everything onto a university career, that
is, Logos. In those days, this m eant living like a man. T he result
was a gradual but com plete animus possession that carried over
into a lifelong homosexuality, although she had little or no natural
disposition for this. She had decided that m en w ere too painful
and th e conflict too hard.



                           L e c t u r e "Tw ELVE
W e spoke last week o f P ru e’s fatal p act with h er brother Gideon
when she promised to obey him in each and every one o f his
dem ands. Aftenvard she felt, as she said, “as if Sam M ere was
flowing right over us, and I shivered as if I’d got an ague.” This
is not extraordinary since she had just slain h er own feeling and
h er relatedness so that it was natural that she felt deadly cold. She
has just given in to the animus and sold herself to the cold inhu-
216            The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



man mind, so no wonder she shivered. W hen she feels as if Sam
M.ere were flowing right over h e r,itlo o fa as though s h e had fallen
righ tin and was possessed by the animus, but the one redeem ing
.featu rejs th a t j h e ..notices it. In th e m om ent that you know you
are possessed— and Prue always rem em bered that she had made
^ i s vow and enslaved herself—you are no longer quite identical
with the animus.
     Gideon and Prue then go and have their breakfast by the fire.
“So I went in and lit the fire, and set the table as nice as I could,
for it seem ed a bit of com fort in a dark place.” T here is the same
m otif of the warm, quieting fire in W uthering H eights w here the
animus, Heathcliff, also gets the upper hand. W h en instinct has
been pushed into the cold away from th e animal and hum an herd,
a craving for a warm and glowing fire is natural. B y the fireplace,
Gideon goes m ore fully into his plans. Prue will have to work
for him exactly like a man, only harder. T he only consolation is
that, in order to save money, she is to learn to read, write, and do
accounts, which was something rare in those days for the farming
class. Sq she was to go to the local wizard, paying for h er lessons
by still more work.
      Now, in learning to read _and write, .P ru e is given a weapol).
that plays an im portant role ,later in .w in n m g h e rfre e d o m . It is_
clear that by accepting ones masculinity, by developJng ones
mind, one acquires spiritualfreedom and in d e p e n d e n ce .h a tis
also liberation from possession.. This is a great gain, and .if you
go right through with it, you can win back the Eros side as well
so that you have both Logos and Eros. Thus animus possession,
negative as it is in itself, can in the end turn out to be a great gain.
It is difficult to reach your mind without going through a period of
animus possession. Learning to use it is well described in Em m a
Jungs excellent paper on the problem of the animus.47 Nothing
helps more than this ^ p e o f possession, for the animus is primar-
ily her unconscious mind. It may sound peculiar that Gideon gets
her as a slave and at the same tim e gives h er something that she

wants so badly. But the animus is com pletely paradoxical. If one
can stand the test and not go com pletely under— which P ru e suc-
ceeds in doing— then one can gain a lot even from such an animus
as Gideon.
   Then Prue rem em bers that they have not yet told th e rooks
that there had b een a death on the place. She says:

       It’s an old custom to tell them. Folk say if you dunna, a dis-
       content comes over them, and they fall into a melancholy
       and forget to come home. So in a little while there are your
       ellums with the next still dark fruit on the sky, but all silent
       and deserted. And although rooks do a deal of mischief, it is
       very unlucky to lose them, and the house they leav e never has
       as prosperation after. So I remember Gideon of this, and we
       went to the rookery.

Evidently they are not falling com pletely out o f nature despite the
ambitiousness o f G ideon’s plans. Rooks are symbols o f the spirit,
o f the Logos side, so th ey com e in aptly after the victory o f the
animus.48
   Von Fran z related to m e a legend about Apollo and the nymph
Coronis, the parents o f Asclepius, th at legendaary G reek god of
m edicine. During C oronis’s pregnancy she is supposed to have
had an affair with a man whose nam e m eant “strength.” Apollo
curses h er and, although previously white, he turns h er into a
black crow or rook. She is then burnt, but Apollo saves Asclepius
from h er womb.
     T he rook, crow, and raven often have to do with the initial onset
o f individuation and a sign o f the direction it m ay take. Apollo was
the god o f D elphi and th e raven was his bird, their flight patterns
studied for divinatory purposes. So these birds would be related
to the sorceress quality that Prue shows throughout the book
 and which M ary W ebb also had. This prophetic spirit lies near

218              The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



instinct, and this property will probably turn out to help h er make
her way back to h er lost instinct and soul.
    Now, Prue learns to read and write from M aister Beguildy
who is the local wizard. H e has a daughter, Jancis, a beautiful
young woman, who plays the role o f P ru e’s shadow. Two years
)ater, Gideon (against all his principles) falls in love with her. Prue
is jealous of h er from the beginning. E ven as a child she says:


       She’d got a very white skin, creamy white without any colour
       unless she was excited or shy, and her face was dimpled and
       soft, and just the right plumpness. She'd got a red, smiling
       mouth and when she smiled the dimples ran each into the
       other. Times I would almost have strangled her for that smile.

As Prue slowly learns how h er hare lip cuts her off from men,
she naturally finds it m ore and m ore difficult not to hate Jancis
for h er beauty although h er natural kindness prevents h er from
doing any direct harm.
   The old wizard recognizes P ru e’s cleverness and accepts her as
a pupil. The b etter your mind, the more difficult it is not to fall a
victim to the animus, and Prue is a clever girl. Beguildy does not
want his beautiful daughter to m arry but wants to keep her as a
sort of prostitute for the rich m en o f the neighborhood, which he
thinks will bring in m ore money. Although Beguildy dabbles in
all kinds of magic, Prue considers him to be less harmful than is
usually supposed. It is really quite in ch aracter that Prue should
get h er learning from a wizard, because in animus possession,
the woman is often attracted to the occult. I can remind you of
M adame Blavatsky, a p ro to ^ p e o f the animus-possessed wom­
an. 49 Then there is also Anna Kingsford, about whom Aniela Jaffé

psychic powers, was the founder of Theosophy and the Modem Theosophical Society in

rehgious, philosophical, and occult concepts which— she claimed—she had derived from
the fountainhead himself in Tibet. She argued that all major religions are derived from one
original religious philosophy and did much for the introduction of primarily Buddhist and
Brahmanic theories to the We st, in particular those of pantheistic evolution, karma and re-

is lecturing, who was also attracted to th e occult.50 T h e religious
instinct is, so to speak, w arped by animus possession, and then
the w om an is easily attracted to th e occu lt or magic. M oreover, it
all fits in with the p attern o f the h are lip and particularly with the
rooks, those birds o f divination. P ru e has to have it out w ith evil,

advocate of women's rights, animal rights, and vegetarianism. She established Theosophy in
England. She promoted a Western, Christian, and Hermetic esotericism that diverged with
the Oriental esotericism of Helena Blavatsky as well as a more feminist interpretation of the

    m ere in sight o f all the folks at the funeral wake with the hopes
    that she will then be healed. W hen she speaks o f this to Gideon
    and her mother, neither likes the idea, so she gives in and runs
    away to the attic o f the house w here she cries for a long time.
    Then, in that enigmatic style o f M ary W ebb, she says:
I
          It being very still there, with the fair shadows of the apple
          trees peopling the orchard outside, that was void, as were
          the meadows, Gideon being in the far field making hay-
          cocks, which I also should have been doing, there came to
          me, I cannot tell whence, a most powerful sweetness that
          had never come to me afore. It was not religious, like the
          goodness of a text heard at a preaching. It was beyond that.
          It was as if some creature made all of light had come on
          a sudden from a great way off, and nestled in my bosom.
          On all things there came a fair, lovely look, as if a different
          air stood over them. It is a look that seems ready to come
          sometimes on those gleamy mornings after rain, when they
          say, “so fair the day, the cuckoo is gèing to heaven.” Only
          this was not of the day, but o summat beyond it. I cared not
          to ask what it was. F or when the nut-hatch comes into her
          own tree, she dunna ask who planted it, nor what name it
          bears to me. For the tree is all to the nut-hatch, and this was
          all to me . . . . For though it was so quiet, it was a miracle,
          and it changed my life; for when I was lost for something.to
          tum to, I’d run to the attic, and it was a core of sweetness
          in much bitter.

       T he apples w ere kept in the attic, and Prue speaks of their
    participation in the miracle which seldom cam e. But the taste of
    it was always in the attic. Three or four months later, she says:

          I fell to thinking how all this blessedness of the attic came to
          me though being curst. For if I hadna had a hare lip to fright-
          en me awayinto my own lonesome soul, this would never
          have come to me. The apples would have crowded all in vain
               Animus Figures in Literature and in Modern Life                         221



      to see a marvel, for I should never have known the glory that
      came from the other side of silence. Even while I was think-
      ing this, out of nowhere suddenly came that lovely thing, and
      nestled in my heart, like a seed from the core of love.

    W e can endorse a good deal o f her own interpretation. F o r
instance, that it was only h er curse which drove h er inward in
ord er to lead to this m iraculous m ystical experience. It may
have b een like a seed from th e co re o f love, from the lost E ros
principle. T he experience is very like the description o f the unio
mystica and, as such, goes beyond what I would like to deal with
in words. Psychologically, we might assume that it is somewhere
related to th e divine aspect o f the Self. I felt quite unable to
deal with this terrific experience until I spoke to von Franz.
She said that although th e experience is not visual, the author
uses images as illustrations which give valuable hints as to the
essence o f this indescribable experience, such as the nuthatch
in its tree and the apples that crow ded around. The nuthatch is
a small, nimbly-creeping, tree-clim bing bird which lives close to
the house and can be tam ed.51 These images, as von Franz points
out, lend them selves to discussion m uch b etter than the main
mystical experience. I f I have understood him correctly, Jung has
often said that in the case o f animus possession, a woman can­
not directly return to h er instinct. She cannot com e down from
th e attic and onto the main road except slowly and carefully. An
animus-possessed woman cannot return to h er instinct directly
but m ust go through the spiritual side o f the animus and reach the
instinct again by that route. W hen we talked about the rooks, we
tou ch ed on this aspect, and with the image of the nuthatch and
the apples it becom es much clearer. In the attic, so to speak, she
becom es a “bird with wings.” That is, she is back in nature, but

51. [Nuthatch (of the Sittidae family) is a common name for about twenty species of birds
widely distributed in the northern hemisphere. Noted for their arboreal dexterity, they move
about on vertical surfaces of tree trunks and even on the undersides of branches, using their
powerful feet and long claws; they are the only tree-climbing birds that move head down-
ward. They probe the bark for adult insects, larvae, and eggs. They also feed on grain and
nuts, breaking them by pecking at the hard outer coatings with their bills. Ed.]
222              The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



here on the spiritual side, not yet on the m ore earthly feminine
side. F ro m this point of view, the nuthatch might be a new form
of the rook, a spirit that has its own special tree; it has gained a
hom e with roots in the earth. The fact that Prue says she feels
like the nuthatch, which has com e to its own tree, justifies us in
     assumption that it is, in a way, Prue herself who is creeping
back to an existence which has roots, even though they belong to
h er tree and not to her personally. The p act with the animus has
made h er a bird which does not find a place for greater growth.
She has to reach the instinct again, but she cannot go straight
back to what she was before she made h er pact with Gideon, and
she can only go forward via the bird. She has to go via the Logos
toward individuation.
   In the case of the apples, one thinks o f the Garden o f Eden.
They represent the gnosis, the knowledge o f good and evil,
which one could say is one of the main them es of the book. Both
her biographers say that the mystical experience conferred on
Prudence S am was actually based on W eb b’s own knowledge and
bears the obvious stamp o f the truth o f experience lived.
      After Prue’s insightful incident in the attic, or possibly as an
emanation from it, Gideon begins to fall seriously in love with
Jancis. The C om Laws w ere passed just after W aterloo, which
m ade Gideons prospects o f riches m ore feasible.52 H e and Prue
worked harder than ever, but his plans w ere now seriously hin-
dered by his love for Jancis. (Gideon naturally wants everything:
Jancis, the large house, and the luxuries.) The two work incredibly
hard, getting up at four in the morning and working till after dark.
   Jancis is m ore like a fairy than a human girl, but she can also
be seen as G ideons anima— as well as a shadow figure o f Prue—

52. [The Com Laws, imposing duties on imported com, passed in 1815, were designed to
preserve the abnormally high profits of the Napoleonic war years and to safeguard farm-
ers from the consequences of their wartime euphoria when farms had changed hands at
exorbitant prices, loans and mortgages having been accepted on impossible terms. Tlie Corn
Laws, however, resulted in skyrocketing costs for food, depressed the domestic market for
manufactured goods (people spent the bulk of their earnings on food rather than commodi-
ties), and caused great distress among the working classes and manufacturers in the towns.
After more than thirty years of heatedly debated revisions and reforms, they were repealed
in 1848. Ed.]

being perfectly confident in her power to attract men. B u t she
is also bone lazy. It was the loss o f confidence that led Prue to
accep t the p act with Gideon so that we should expect to find this
missing value in the pow er o f the animus.
    T h at Gideon falls in love is, on the one side, a positive thing,
since it humanizes the animus and shadow, that sort o f “two-
to -o n e” against consciousness. Prue therefore has to overcom e
a good deal in herself before she can accept Jancis as a “sister-
in-law.” She definitely places herself on the side o f Jancis and
overcom es h er jealousy, as least as far as consciousness is con-
cern ed , and this attitude is richly rew arded, for it is at Jancis’s
love-spinning that she meets the man whom she is to marry. All

over onto the weaver. As a m atter o f fact it is the normal develop­
m ent, first the father, then the brother, and then the loved man.
K ester represents primarily the positive animus or, as he is very
human, the real man onto whom the animus is projected.
   T h e.fa cL th a t-h e .is a w eaver is_ m o stim p ortan t. The woman
spins the yam , but the weaving o f the whole design and the bring-
ing together o f the threads is done by the weaver. In mythology
this is always done by the daughters father (that is, within the
realm o f the feminine). The only example o f a man assuming
this role that von Fran z knew of is the story o f King Thrushbeard
w here he com es to the court as a beggar and attracts the atten­
tion o f the prince with a golden spinning wheel. In her book The
F em in in e in Fairy Tales, von Franz notes that the activity o f spin­
ning is related to fantasy and wishful thinking. Figures like Odin
are the ^ p ical spirit o f such magical thought, and Odin is the lord
of wishes. W ishes turn the wheels of thought. Both the activity
o f the spinner and the spinning wheel are proper to Odin, but
in the King Thrushbeard tale the girl has to spin to help support
224              The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



her husband. Thrushbeard, here the animus, rules over what the
woman as such should do. H e has taken possession even of the
properly feminine activity in her. 53
   Therefore, the Eros principle can be seen as being still in the
  hands of the animus, although K ester is a highly positive figure.
/     The fact that the w eaver com es on the scene saves the situa­
  tion and prevents the possibility of animus and shadow becoming
too strong for consciousness. T h ere is not a definite quatem ity
with Prue and Gideon on one side as possessed animus and anima
and the weaver Kester and Jancis on th e other. At first only Prue,
Gideon, and Jancis are related and this through the negative
animus. There is a certain relationship betw een Prue and Jancis,
but the relationship is mainly through Gideon. It is a lifeline for
Prue when the w eaver appears, and she connects immediately
with her experience in the attic. This is really her link with reality,
for the weaver is a very human figure whereas Gideon and Jancis
are almost figures of the unconscious. But there is a fatal barrier
here: Prue is still bound to Gideon by h er oath, and then there is
her hare lip. Although she sees the weaver at the love-spinning,
she hides from him, and he does not see her.
   But then again something happens that initiates a link on the
other side. The old wizard has prom ised to “raise Venus” in all
her naked glory for the local squire’s son for five pounds. Venus is,
of course, to be Jancis. She com es in tears to Prue, for if Gideon
hears o f it, he will immediately break off the engagem ent. As
there is to be little light, Prue says that she will replace Jancis on
the promise of com plete secrecy, unless Gideon hears o f it, in
which case, he alone is to be told the truth of who actually played
Venus rising. Prue says:

       As I came up clear of the trap, and hung there in the rosy
       light, the young squire started forward in his chair and held
       out his hands like a child at a pastry shop. But I knew he

    was under solemn oath not to stir from his chair. I thought it
    must be strange for men to go through life holding out their
    hands on this side and on that, to be always the pastry cake
    in the window with hungry eyes on it. Then all of a sudden I
    heard a movement on the other side of the room, and turn-
    ing that way I could have cried aloud, for- there sat Kester
    Woodseaves . . . . He was leaning forward Ike the young
    squire, and he made to hold his arms out and then drew back
    and gave a sigh, and I know that the desire of woman was
     stirring within him, it came on me then with great joy that it
     was my own self and no other that had made him hold out his
     arms. F o r in that place he could not see my curse, he could
     only see me gleaming pale as any woman would.


L a te r she says: “I took my crum b, and behold it was the L ord ’s
Supper.”
  T h e squire, who thinks it was Beguildy's daughter, then offers
the wizard a large sum for a night with Jancis. H e r father tells her
that she m ust either consent o r go to the hiring fair, which m eant
being engaged by somebody as dairymaid or tótchen w ench and
being bonded for th ree years. So Jancis com es crying to P rue and
Gideon. P ru e says that she knew this was “his hour of choice”
and consciously tried to influence him in Jancis’s favor. B ut there
are signs o f jealousy in P ru e, and Gideon does not understand.
M oreover, what has m ade the squire so eager all of a sudden?
Jancis’s eyes implore P ru e to speak out, but she is afraid that if
she does it m ight get around to the w eavers ears. Afterward, she
herself thinks that if she had spoken, it would have turned the
scale in Jancis’s favor. B u t as it is, Gideon refuses to save Jancis by
im m ediate m arriage and decides for the hiring fair.
   On th e day o f the fair, another link is forged in the fate of
K ester and Prue. T h ere is to be a bullbaiting with dogs, a cruel
sport that used to be com m on in England. K ester, who is devoted
to animals, does not want it to take place. H e tries to stop it at the
price o f taking on all the dogs himself. H e is very f riendly with
animals and has a special relationship with them , and he has made
  226          The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



 friends with most o f the dogs on market days. H e ties them all
 up except the last one, a fierce dog that does not know him. It is
 Grimble’s new dog. H e manages to tie him up, but before he can
 get far enough away the dog flies at his throat. Prue had greatly
 feared for him, so she had hidden a knife and enlisted the aid
/ o f the apothecary. She is able, just in tim e, to slit open the dog’s
  throat, kill it, and get the apothecary to Kester, and thus she saves
 K esters life.

 on our part. .Now, K ester was able to overcom e all the other dogs,
 so symbolically he could be seen as the symbol of relationship.
 B ut there was one strange dog which could only be killed by the
 knife. This is the tool o f Logos, which is far nearer to P ru es own
 hands, and it is connected with the fact that she has accepted her
 animus1possession and is still more in connection with the bird.
 She cam e to the Self as a bird to its tree, and therefore she has a
 certain right to use the knife.
     Symbolically, dogs are often found in the context of human
 relationship, so it is no w onder that Kester could deal with them .
 But the dog that is too fierce for this treatm ent represents a
 pattern throughout the whole book. As we shall see at the end,
 the problem o f evil meets with no definitive solution. H ere, the
 w orst and fiercest aspect o f an instinct is killed. This is a certain
 aspect that is just too evil for the woman to deal with. It can only
 be locked up, or in this case killed, a fact that nearly costs Prue
 h er own life. Symbolically she will have to pay the entire price for
 w hat she does, and this m otif could be connected with the them e
 o f either sacrificing part o f the instinct or sublimating it. A part
 can be legitimately sublimated, although we now have to com e
 to term s with the scapegoat o f Leviticus which was driven out to
 the desert and killed (Leviticus 1 6 :5 -1 0 ). Such a dog could be
 seen as representing the wildest emotions and affects. W e must
 dis-identify with such wild emotion. E m m a Jung said in a seminar
 that there are times when one should use emotion. Jung added
               Animus Figures in Literature and in M odem Life



that this was true, but one should never be its slave. O ne should
only use em otion when one is not identical with it, when one can
just as well do without it. I f th e dog had been left alive, the posi­
tive side o f P ru es animus would have been killed and thus h er
only chance o f getting back to h e r own principle would have been
destroyed. Practically speaking, one must sacrifice such emotions
in order to relate to those who one loves.54
    P ru es m other now takes a hand in th e game. W hen she hears
o f P ru es action with the dog, she is sure that h er daughter loves
K ester and sends for the weaver. Still determ ined to hide h er hare
lip, Prue goes away while he is there, but old Mrs. Sam praises
h er in th e highest term s to th e weaver, who says, “W ell, single I
am, and single shall stay, I believe. B ut if ever I did think o f ask-
ing to wed, it ud be just such another as th a tn .” Prue is thus sup-
ported to the utm ost by h er m other, although Prue usually speaks
o f her rath er as a child. Yet h er m other turns out to be the kind
o f earth a girl can root in, and thus she helps Prue to m eet the
curse o f the Sams, her paternal inheritance. The fact that Prue
runs away and leaves all activity to h er m other is far fr^m ideal.
She does not stand to h er own feminine nature, which is due to
the fact that the animus has indentured the Eros and she is still
possessed by Gideon. T he feminine side waves, as it w ere, behind
her back.
   In the m eantim e, Gideon and Jancis are corresponding but by
 means o f both Prue and the weaver, who write their letters for
 them . H ere, Prue begins to use her writing skills for herself, for
 the letters she writes for Jancis are actually love letters to Kester,
 and his responses w ritten in the name o f Gideon are m ore for
 Prue than for Jancis. Jancis also tells Kester th at P ru e was Venus,
 and he has also learned that Prue saved his life. But Prue i s c on-

 228            The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



       Thus far, the shadow has functioned positively. But Prue has
 left too m uch to her shadow, and Jancis now behaves as the shad­
 ow always does in such circum stances. She throws aside h er work
 before her three years o f indentured servitude are finished and
 com es back to the Sams. She cleverly puts the blame on her mas-
Jte r’s son who, she claims, tried to sexually abuse her. B u t the old
 wizard, her father, is angry with her— as well as with Gideon—
 and swears that he will prevent their m arriage at all costs.
    Gradually, Prue becom es assured that the w eaver would
 actually love her if it w ere not for h er hare lip. H er passionate
 fascination with nature is expressed, for example, as she says: “So
 I, finding m a own person and my own life not to my mind, took
 m y pleasures w here I could” (that is, in the natural surroundings
 o f Sam M ere as she stares out o f the cottage window noting that
 she does not like her “hom e”). Curiously enough, pursuing h er
 instinctive love of nature led her to the one place w here she could
 learn to accept herself ( the way to oneself is serpentine and passes
 over many detours and wrong turnings).
  j One of P ru e’s greatest pleasures was watching the metam or-
 phosis of the chrysalis of the dragonfly. T he “eth er’s mon” or
 “eth er’s nild” they called them at Sam , for it was supposed that
 an ether (that is, an adder) lay hidden in the grass beneath where
 the dragonfly hovered, the dragonflies thus giving a warning from
 above. While Prue was watching them , Kester com es to thank her
 for saving his life, and for the first time they stand face to face.
 Prue tries to run away, but he prevents her. H e as much as tells
 h er that he loves her but needs a year to settle w hether o r not he
 should marry her. In their happiness, they quite forget the poison-
 ous snakes in the grass. E ven worse, K ester tells Prue that if one
 thinks rightly about sin, it just isn’t there. H e is convinced that evil
 is the m ere absence of good, but this conviction is dangerous for
 someone who has signed a pact with the evil side of h er animus
 and who has the lightning in h er blood, that is, the actual destiny
 o f having it out with evil. Nevertheless, afterward she applies this
 conviction to her lip, claiming it was her sin even if but a kind of
 innocent wickedness. And she concludes that all the rest of her is
            Animus Figures in Literature and in Modern Life        229    ,



righteous and in glory. At this m om ent, a rushing happiness passes
through her which helps her win back som e o f her confidence in
herself. But it also brings h er perilously close to an inflation.
    T h e harvest that year is th e best on record, and when all the
fields are cut, they celebrate the so-called “love carriage,” that is,
the neighborhood farmers com e with their wagons and give free
service. Kester, the weaver, com es as well arid goes further in
prom ising him self to Prue, explaining that he is going to London
for a year to learn color weaving and will com e back to say som e­
thing to h er then. At this point, the quaternity is very, near setting
itself through. T he harvest is gathered in, Gideon and Jancis are
to be m arried within a week, K ester and P ru dence in a year. But
it is a dangerous sign that th e negative animus and the shadow
are to m arry first. Then, what seem s to be a small omission on
the p art o f Prue turns up again, as is so often th e case in- life,
for the individuation process entails a dynamic progression and
finds every weakness in the retort. It is just in the m om ent when
m om entous events in- th e individuation process are çonstellated
that one m ust take the greatest precaution. T he m ost dangerous
tim e is when one gets closely involved with such events and when
one thinks: “Now I am safe.”
   Prue has refused Jancis’s plea to tell Gideon about Venus, and
Gideon now insists on sleeping with Jancis before their wedding
in order to set his doubts to rest. Prue earlier refused to let Jancis
tell him because she was afraid that th e w eaver would hear, but
now she is aware that the w eaver knows. Still she does not inter­
fere, thinking that it is only a week before th e wedding, and she
is glad that Gideon should show any human feeling at all. It does
not sound like m uch, but it turns out to be a fatal omission. To
tell w ould have been a great sacrifice, but it would have borne
b etter fruit. F o r Gideon’s behavior leads to a chain o f disasters.
The old wizard com es hom e unexpectedly and finds his daughter
and Gideon in his bed. H e had always been against the marriage,
but now he has a real grievance against Gideon. H e sets fire to
Gideon’s ricks and the whole harvest is reduced to ashes in a
few hours.
 230           The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



    W e have to ask what th e wizard represents in Prue’s psychol­
 ogy. In Gideons first fight with his father, he wished he could
 be Beguildys son and the devil could have his soul. W e said that
  Gideon thus opened up a connection with evil in its collective
  aspect. The wizard is a figure par excellence who works in the
/ realm o f collective evil. Prue has always underestim ated the evil in
  the wizard somewhat along those lines possibly implied by Kester
 when he claims that if you think the right way about sin, well, then
 it is just not there. Although K ester is such a positive figure, the
 situation is always explosive when the woman “thinks the right
 way” and is not living by her own principle o f Eros. Fu rtherm ore,
 the fact that the wizard is able to destroy everything they possess
 is connected with Eros actually being here in the hands of the
 animus. The weaving would seem safe enough in K ester’s hands,
 but the animus is always dual (that is, positive and negative), and
 the wizard can also be regarded as the fully unconscious and dark
 side of' the weaver. As von Fran z points out, the act of spinning
 is often associated with wishful thinking. Odin is the typical spirit
 o f such magical thoughts, and he is the lord o f wishes. Thers:1 was
 a lot o f wishful thinking in K esters and Prue’s exchange. Evil is
 explained away, the adder under the dragonfly is forgotten, and
 all the darkness repressed and ignored falls into the hands o f
 the wizard. H e spins the wishful fantasy, sets it into m otion, and
 causes the conflagration. This happens when we forget the dark
 side and unconsciously help evil with our left hand, that is, play
 into the hands o f the very evil that we consciously oppose. I once
 served on a com m ittee that was, in m y opinion, taking a line o f
 action that was absolutely fatal, and yet it was pushed through.
 W hat I did not see until afterward was that my m anner o f opposi-
 tion had been inadvertently and unconsciously fostering it along.
 Despite my convictions to the opposite, I had actually helped it
 along. W hen one is adamantly positive on the one side, one must
 be careful o f what is hidden on the other.
    Gideon, that is, the m ore individual aspect o f P rue’s negative
 animus, is really the one who allows the concupiscentia to burst
 and thus destroys the quaternity. As we know, “all haste is of the
             Animus Figures in Líterature and in Modern Life              231...




devil,” and Gideon is the one to let loose in haste. H e thinks that
the squire has had Jancis, so why should he not take her as well.
H e even acts partly to forestall a possible action o f the squire’s.
This again is som ething we often see in real life: an animus con ­
viction that som eone will actually carry out this or that stirs us
into foolish hasty action which we afterward see was brought
about simply by the animus him self having inserted the idea. T he
squire is not really after Jancis at all; she is a bit short and plump.
H e is actually looking for a tall graceful figure (Prue). And P ru es
silence, o f course, is also a typical sort of hook. She had not said
that it was she whom he was really after. That silence seems
like such a small hook, yet first the individual negative animus
(Gideon) followed by the m ore collective negative animus (the
wizard) w ere able to radically inflate the em otion precisely on this
hook and initiate the conflagration that woke Prue to the convic­
tion that the L ast Judgm ent had com e.
   Afterw ard, one disaster follows the other. Gideon sets out to
m urder the wizard, but Prue prevents him by sending the police
to arrest Beguildy.


      “They’ll take Beguildy to prison,” I said. “You munna have
      murder on your soul, lad, things be bad enough without that.”
      “It would have eased me,” he answered with a strange look
      “Its all damned up within, choking, choking me. ‘Twould
      have eased me to kll un. I’Hnever mend of it now.”

   I t is, o f cou rse, positive that Prue prevents the m urder and
that she appeals to law and ord er in h er psyche. B u t, G ideons
pessimism is also justified, and things go from bad to worse.

 an attem pt to leave Gideon, saying that m urder cancels all vows,
 but she cannot bring herself to go because Gideon shows signs of
 mental derangem ent. E ven before Janciss suicide, P ru e suspect-
 ed him o f seeing th e ghost o f their mother. One evening when
 he is intensely haunted, he follows the ghost o f Jancis out to the
/m e re , and here he is also dro^ned. Thus this pair can be said to
 have fallen into the unconscious. T he m other, also dead, returns
 to the unconscious.
     As with Gideon, it is ^ p ical o f th e negative animus that when
 the whole outer action is left in his hands he fails to stand to what
 he has done. In this story, this failure is a d irect result both o f ani­
 mus possession and the fact that P ru e has prom ised to obey him
 in every particular. Gideon promised marriage to Jancis and even
 got her with child, but the fatal twist com es when he denies his
 promises and behaves as if it had never happened. Being utterly
 inhuman, he is even capable o f murder. B ut Prue leaves her
 m other unprotected. She does not actively stand by h er m other
 along with the w eaver but runs away instead due to an animus
 assumption concerning h er hare lip. The animus likes to slip in
 w here we leave something undone. Jung_saysthat a w om anonly
 finds her way through to in&yiduationJ)y_.goi!}g_ th ro u g h t(u th e
 bitter end with her animus. But, as with Gideon, an animus left
 to him self will never go through to the bitter end.

 Gideon may well have inflicted a lasting blow. One could wonder
 if he has not killed the m other within Prue (as a symbolically logi-
 cal conclusion that he has not only killed his own mother, but the
 m other o f his child as well). Throughout the book, P ru e repeat-
 edly talks o f her happy old age with Kester. B ut no children are
 mentioned (and M ary W ebb herself was childless). Originally, it
 was the child m ore than the husband who Prue longed for. But
 you do not swear to obey an ambitious worldly animus unscathed.
 \Ve can look at her syinbolically as having been sterilized, so to
 speak, through the loss o f h er anim uss own child. Looked at
            Anim us Figures in Literature and in M odem Life        233



subjectively and symbolically, she has killed h er own chance of
becom in g a mother.
   As soon as the positive animus is reduced, we are confronted
with th e responsibility for our o ^ n lives. P ru e is now left in sole
possession o f the farm with responsibility for everything. It is
already a m onth after the date K ester prom ised to return, and the
deeply rooted opinion concerning h er hare lip begins to ride h er
again. She has no idea o f w h ere to go, but after one night spent
alone with h e r m em ories in the old family house, she determ ines
never to spend another night there again. Taking up life alone in
the old stead is m ore than she can stand, so she decides to leave
the farm to its fate. This is typical o f how a m odern woman often
reacts w hen she finds h erself freed from animus possession. She
just walks away, a sort of: “I did not do it. T h erefore it has nothing
to do with m e /’ It is understandable, yet exceedingly unconscious,
for w e now have the task o f leam ing to take responsibility for what
our animus is doing . . . or has done. T h e tendency o f wom en just
to walk away is particularly clear h ere in P ru e’s simply leaving the
farm to its fate.
   T h e next day th ere is a big fair on the banks o f the Sam M ere,
the only day in the year when anybody from the outside world
com es to Sam . Prue grabs the opportunity to sell all the livestock
on the farm and thus attends the fair com pletely unaware o f what
awaits h er there. W e have heard before o f Grimble and Huglet,
two particularly rough m en, and these two are still angry with
K ester. Grimble is in fact also angry with P ru e for having knifed
and killed his dog, and he seizes the opportunity for revenge.
Pru e, he says, is' a hare-shotten witch, and he lays every disaster
that has happened at h er door. H e says that she was friendly with
the wizard because she was a witch, that all the m ischief in the
neighborhood cam e from her, and that she incited Beguildy to
incinerate Gideons ricks; that she was the one who poisoned h er
m other, she killed Jancis and the baby, and last night, in order to
possess herself o f all the S am property, she pushed Gideon into
the m ere. Grimble’s words alone would hardly have been taken by
the crow d, but he has produced Tivvy, the sexton’s daughter and
234              The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



household help at Sam (whose ears P ru e once boxed) to support
him. She is now expecting Gideon’s child and she hopes to whiten
herself by blackening Prue. This is T iw y’s m ost im portant appear-
ance in the story except when she was trying to blackmail Gideon
into marrying her with the very real evidence that he had poi-
/Soned his m other. Now, o f course, she twists it around and claims
 that Prue did it. Before Prue realizes what is happening she finds
herself tied up as a witch to the ducking stool and is already half
in the w ater when K ester turns up and learns o f her predicam ent.
    \Ve must consider the fact that she was actually tied to the
witch’s stool. The vow to Gideon was the old archetypal pattern,
and when such a thing is started, it can seldom be prevented
from running its course to the end. Being tied to the w itch’s stool
is being pinned down to what she has done. Gideon would have
been quite powerless to put through his ambitious schem es if
she had withheld her consent. In the M alleus M aleficarum , it is
repeatedly emphasized that the devil cannot do anything without
a human instrument to assist him.55
   Pr-1-e is pinned down only after being freed from h er vow,
which corresponds with m odern experience. W hile possessed,
we cannot realize what we have done. This only happens after
the possession has passed, which gives rise to many a feeling of
injured innocence. The fact that it went to this length, however,
is directly connected with Prue’s having abandoned S am and with
h er rejecting the responsibility for h er own situation. H ad.she not

55. [The Malleus Maleficarum (Latin for “The Witches’ Hammer”) is a famous treatise on
witches published in 1487 by two Inquisitors of the Catholic Church. The main purpose
of the Malleus was to refute systematically skepticism about the reality of witches and to
educate magistrates on the procedures that expose and convict them. Miso^gyn, that is, the
hatred of women, runs rampant. The treatise singled out women as specifically inclined for
witchcraft, they being susceptible to demonic temptations due to their manifold weaknesses.
The Malleus Maleficarum accuses witches of such things as infanticide, cannibalism, casting
evil spells to harm their enemies, sending young women to seduce older men, having the
power to steal men’s penises, and so forth. Accounts of witches committing these crimes are
“well documented.” Its success was due not only to the tendency of the human mind to see
the shadow in others (here, priests in the object of their dire interest, women), but also to
Gutenbergs invention of the printing press and the innovations that followed, which enabled
the treatise to be disseminatedrapidly throughout Europe. Estimates of the number ac-
cused and executed, mostly women, range from 100,000 to 900,000. The book made its way
across the Atlantic and was employed in the Salem witch trials. Ed.]

w anted to sell the livestock, she would have had no need to go to
the fair. It was not until th e people saw h er that they b ecam e so
hostile. T herefore w e m ay assume that w hat she might have done
voluntarily is done to her. She is pinned d o ^ n by the judgm ent
o f the crowd.
     I had a repetitive d ream as a child that fits well into this them e.
I had to leave the H ouse o f C om m ons, pass through the front por-
tals, and walk out into a crow d o f people who w ere shouting and
k llin g each other, m uch as in the F re n ch Revolution, and I knew
that if I had the courage to go out unarm ed, the revolution and
the fighting would stop o f its own accord. I always woke up uncer-
tain, trying to gather the courage to do so. In another variation, I
was carried through the crow d in a small carriage and knew that
I was going to be hanged. I never knew w hether the crowd was
friendly or if they would tu m hostile tow ard m e. Jung said that I
had to go out voluntarily into the opposites and then the shouting
would stop, and if I did not, then I would be hanged betw een the
opposites, which had to be faced.

 this book was M ary W ebb’s m asterpiece and h er last com plete

 work. W e can assume that it represents the place which she her­
 self had reached when she w rote the manuscript. Prudence is
 left with a positive and creative animus, and the weaving is in his
 hands. Yet she does not have h er principle in h er o ^ n hands, and
 no quatem ity is established. It is impossible to predict what would
/h a v e happened had M ary W ebb lived longer. She died about
  th ree years after the com pletion of the work. Von Fran z told me
  that most o f the gods and goddesses connected with spinning and
  weaving belong to the beyond, the land of the dead. Therefore,
 the wea ver in this story might represent— beyond his creative
 activity— a psychic activity that is already preparing to weave her
 into a wider pattern that might reach beyond the limits of this
 world into the life beyond death.
    The Bronte°d and Modera Women




Editor's Note: This text is based on Barbara Hannah's lecture
on the Bronte family given in 1951 and 1959. She goes into
great detail on the Bronte siblings in her book, Striving Towards
W holeness (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1971; reprinted by
Chiron Publications, 2001).


I HAVE NEVER READ ANYTHING ABOUT THE THREE BRONTE
sisters that did not begin with an apology for adding to the vast
amount of material which has already collected around their
names. This particular form of apology is hardly necessary here
in Zürich, for they seem to be little known outside of English-
speaking countries. But I would like to admit my foolhardiness
in venturing to say anything about such a bewilderingly difficult
subject. In order to orient ourselves in this family, I would like to
begin with a short sketch of their background.
    Patrick Brunty was born in 1777 at Emdale, Drumballyroney,
County Down, Ireland, the eldest of ten children. Initially, he
was apprenticed to a blacksmith, but his aptitude toward autodi-
dactic education allowed him to pursue a university education.
This was a significant achieve;ment considering his father was an
agricultural laborer of most modest financial means. In October
1802, just twenty-five years old, he registered as a student at St.
John’s College, Cambridge, and changed his name from Brunty
to Bronte. Despite persistent financial struggles, he was academi-
cally always in the top of his class. He was awarded a bachelor
238            The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



o f Arts degree in April 1 8 0 6 and was ordained in the Church of
England in 1807, w here he took up a num ber of term s o f office
as a curate, that is, a reverend. On 29 D ecem b er 1812, Patrick
Bronte m arried Maria Branwell, and they had six children. In
18 2 0 , Patrick was appointed a perm anent position as curate and
r1noved his family to H aw orth, but within a year o f moving into
 their new home, his wife Maria was stricken with can cer and died.
Patrick eventually found the strain o f bringing up a large family
difficult and decided to send Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, and
Em ily to the recently opened Clergy D aughters' School at Cowan
Bridge. The harsh regim e, the cold, and the poor food took their
toll on the children, who w ere eventually rem oved. Maria and
Elizabeth died soon after returning to Haworth. His remaining
four children becam e authors and poets and passed away around
the middle of the century. In 1847, Patrick cam paigned strongly
for improved education in the district and, two years later, for
improvements in the w ater supply. Improvements in education
and sanitation for local people w ere realized within his lifetime.
On O ctober 30, 1859, Patrick Bronte preached his last sermon
from the pulpit o f Haworth Church. On June 7, 1861, he died at
age eighty-four, outliving his wife and all o f his children.
      His wife, Maria, was born in 1783, the eighth o f eleven
children o f Thomas Branwell and Anne C am e o f Penzance,
Cornwall, a prosperous m erchant family with extensive property
holdings in the town. T he family was involved in local politics
as well as trade, M arias brother Benjamin serving as the to^wns
mayor in 1809. The Branwells and the Carnes w ere leading m em ­
bers o f the Wesleyan Methodist com m unity in Penzance, the
Branwells being instrumental in the building o f the town’s first
official Wesleyan chapel in 1814. Maria was petite, plain, intel-
ligent, and well-read with a ready wit, yet lived a sheltered and
cultured existence in a family of pious Methodists.
      Mrs. Elizabeth Gaskell, who w rote the first and classic biogra-
phy of Charlotte Bronte, gives a lively description o f the township
of Penzance with its haunted houses, witches, smuggling, cock-
fights, and the like, but adds proudly: “In the Branwell family itself
                                  The Brontes and M odem Women



the violence and irregularity o f nature did not exist.”1 One suppos-
es that this was what led Maria Branwell to find herself a husband
in w hom th ese qualities also existed, and in no small measure. And
Patrick B ron te was a parson, a profession which could readily be
swallowed by h erself and h er M ethodist ancestors.
   She m et th e Reverend Patrick B ronte in 1812, and he
prom pdy began a short but determ ined courtship (he repeatedly
walked a twenty-four-m ile round trip simply to take M aria out for
a stroll). H e was exceptionally good looking as well, so it was easy
to forget his simple Irish ancestors with their wild tem peram ents
and their tu rf huts, and Ireland was conveniently far away. N ot
th at she probably had m uch choice in the matter. She w ent to
Yorkshire on a visit to an uncle when Patrick Bronte was a curate
in th e neighborhood, and the courtship quickly evolved. The two
w ere m arried before th e end o f the year. In 1814 their first child,
Maria, was born, and Elizabeth cam e in 1815, the year he was
appointed curate at Thornton near Bradford, where his next three
daughters— C harlotte (1 8 1 6 ), Em ily (1 8 1 8 ), and Anne (1 8 2 0 )—
and his only son, Branwell (1 8 1 7 ), were' born. M,aria m ade friends
easily, and those whom the Brontes m et in their years in Thornton
rem ained lifelong friends to Patrick and his children. Maria’s only
extant written work, apart from private correspondence, is the
tract, “T h e Advantages o f Poverty, In Religious Concerns,” but it
was never published. It was about seven years into the marriage
that Mr. Bronte was given the curacy o f Haworth in Yorkshire
 (which he then held for forty years), and there within a year
 M aria was afflicted with can cer (probably o f the uterus) and, fol-
 lowing a harrowing seven-and-a-half-m onth illness, she died on
 15 Septem ber 1821. The Bronte children w ere raised there in
 H aw orth, where they lived m ost o f their short lives. The small,

piws before, but there is an unusually concrete quality about this
shadow in the case o f th e Brontes. I puzzled over this for a long
tim e, and then I realized that, by a curious combination of cir-
cum stances— and within their narrow limits and in spite of their
early Victorian background— the Bronte family m et with just
those problems that have b ecom e worldwide today.
   To begin with, and perhaps most im portant of all, there were
five sisters and one brother. The two eldest sisters died as children,
it is true, but even then it was three to one. This is, o f course, com -
mon enough, but it is usually to some extent compensated in the
environment. This was not the case with the Brontes for they were
unusually confined within their own limits. Mr. Bronte was exceed-
ingly unsociable, and his parishioners w ere much o f the same
mind. “W hat sort o f a parson have you got?” someone once asked
a Yorkshire man at that time. “A rare good one,” was the reply, “he
minds his own business and never troubles himself with ours.” Mr.
Bronte was excellent at minding his own business, but he lived in a
constant struggle to fit his tem peram ent into his parsons coat. One
outlet he devised for himself was to fire pistols in rapid succession
out of the back door; this must have discouraged any callers there
might have been. As the children grew up, the efforts of Charlotte,
the sociable one of the family, did to some extent mitigate their
rigid seclusion; but even so, their male society was exceedingly
limited and mainly confined to curates. And it is only necessary to
read Charlottes Shirley in order to discover what the Bronte girls
thought of curates!2 At home, and in their short flights into the
outside world, the female sex was always in a large majority.

   F u rth erm o re, Yorkshire was and still is a m anufacturing
county. I t lives mainly by its textile trade. T h e com ing o f the
industrial age and th e rep lacem en t o f hand laborers by industrial
textile looms affected Yorkshire earlier and far m ore gravely than
m ost o f th e rest o f England. T h e fam ous riots and the wholesale
destruction o f m achinery took place before the B rontes’ tim e. In
181 1 , a group o f w orkers in En glan d form ed a secret organization
whose targets w ere th e w ide-fram e textile stocking m achines,
labor-saving devices th at caused falling wages and widescale
unem ploym ent am ong laborers in the Midlands. In the first year
o f th e riots, over a thousand m achines w ere smashed. T h e move-
m en t spread from N ottingham shire to Lancashire and Cheshire
and later to Yorkshire. F o r c e was then used to p rotect m achines:
1 2 ,0 0 0 troops w ere stationed, for instance, in Yorkshire, and
governm ent agents spied on everyone. B etw een 1811 and 1817,
many leaders of th e revolt w ere imprisoned, shot, hanged,
beheaded, or shipped off to Australia. B y the tim e the Brontes
 arrived, th e population had suffered severely, and earning one’s
 living was no easy m atter, a problem that would eventually defeat
 Branwell, the only B ron te boy. By that tim e, it was already the
 survival o f th e fittest, and Branwell was anything but the fittest.
    I t was in Branw ell that th e Bronte sisters saw the Faustian
 problem o f good and evil played to a fatal conclusion. In
 th e breast o f the clergym ans son his fath ers ancestors (hard
 drinking and free living) fought against his m others gentle,
 pious Methodist forefathers. T he battlefield was too weak, and
 Branwell, apparently losing his head over a peculiarly foolish love
 affair, and— under his sisters eyes— headed to his death unrem it-
 tingly addicted to opium and drink.
     T h e B ron te sisters, for all the conventions o f the age in which
 they lived, never for a m om ent believed th at the problem o f evil
 could be stam ped out or ignored. It was the most burning of all
 problems to them , and they tackled it valiantly, each in their o^ n
 way. They also tackled the problem o f superfluous women; there
 is very little o f that Victorian “running into the safe haven o f mat-
  rimony” in their books. Marriage is recognized as the center o f

      It would b e easy to say that they failed to fully live their own
lives themselves, but I think this would be a superficial judgment.
It is true that the outer events o f their lives do not amount to very
m uch, or at least not as we know them . T here w ere a few not

children. F o r years they search ed vainly for publishers, and when
at last these w ere found, th eir books w ere greeted with cold con-
tem p t or disagreeable scorn. Only C h arlotte lived long enough to
go over into h er own opposite. She b e ca m e exceedingly famous,
but she did not like th at any b e tte r; in fact, she hated it. It drove
h er to the last step th at she ev er exp ected to take: at the age o f
thirty-seven, she m arried a cu ra te .3 All h er life C harlotte was
troubled by a recu rrin g dream in w hich she was carrying a crying
child in h er arms and could n ot quiet it. B u t she describes herself
as having th e m ost painful sense o f pity for the little thing lying
inert, as sick children do, while she walked about in some gloomy
place with it, such as th e aisle of H aw orth C hurch. She believed
th at this dream was always a prem onition o f trouble. It is th ere­
fore an interesting fact th at she died in the early stages o f h er first
 pregnancy nine months after h er marriage.

          Anne’s novels have no literary merit whatsoever, yet a bored
          public still swallows her two intolerably dull novels in practi-
          cally every new popular edition of thè world’s classics.

       F o r M ay Sinclair, Anne Bronte represents, if nothing else, the
 restless misery o f w om en born into the Victorian age before their
 tim e.4 Anne, rigid in Victorian Puritanism and at the same time
 saturated with Victorian sentim ent, belongs, in the spirit and the
 essence o f h er work— even m ore than Charlotte or Emily— to
 the tw entieth century.5 T h ere are scenes and situations in The
 Tenant o f W ildfell Hall which for their audacity stand alone in
 early Victorian literature and hold their own in the literature of
 the revolt th at followed th e Victorian era.

  Sinclair notes that Anne’s writing has an astonishing lucidity.
An author such as Thackeray would have shrunk from relating
Mrs. Huntingions ultimatum to h er husband. The slamming of
that bedroom door resounds through th e long emptiness o f A nne’s
novel. F o r when Anne slammed the door o f Mrs. H untingtons
}5edroom , she slammed it in th e face o f all existing moralities
and conventions. One can well imagine Mrs. Huntington sitting
quietly outside that door, with an air of integrity, h er hands folded
in h er lap, and vowing to Mrs. Grundy that she knows nothing
about any noise or disturbance o f any kind. Anne B ronte stands
up against the Victorian dogmas; against eternal punishment;
against the w om ans vow o f obedience in marriage. She is actually
taking a stand against the m arriage laws and traditions (although
presumably she would have died rather than own up to it). And
thus Mrs. Huntington may be acknowledged as one o f the first
insurgent m odern heroines.6
   Perhaps Sinclair’s reflections may serve to give som e idea of
w hat broke through into Anne B ro n tes novels in spite o f herself.
F o r she was no rebel in h er conscious life, and she alone among
the three sisters seems to have been designed by nature to make
the ideal parson’s wife. On reading the B ronte literature, one is
forced to the conclusion that A nne, unlike h er sisters, spent her
youth secretly awaiting th e heralding dawn o f h er own curate.
H er books seem to have been written as she was waking up to
the fact that she was living in an age that did not produce enough
curates as "good husbands” to go around. Dull though they are,
h er books are a treasure trove to anyone who is interested in how
the m ediocre woman reacts to m odern conditions.
    The books o f Charlotte Bronte are a totally different proposi-
tion. They have infinitely m ore literary m erit than Annes, and Ja n e

E y re is anything b u t dull. It belongs rath er to the best-seller type,
and indeed it has steadily rem ained a best seller for one hundred
years. C harlotte h erself was shocked beyond m easure when she
discovered th at the popularity o f Ja n e E y re sprang mainly from
the fact th at it was regarded as so delightfully improper.
   This novel has a hackneyed them e: love springs up betw een
Jane E y re , a plain little governess o f eighteen, and M r. Rochester,
h e r w orld-w eary employer. B u t th ere is an elem ent that redeem s
the story, and that is Jan e E y re ’s pow er of seeing and accepting
reality even when it collides with h er unshakable principles or
h e r own interests. Mr. R och ester is am azed ab h er steadfast-
ness, which gives him hope and new life. H e can speak to her,
for instance, about his opera m istress, and she can fully under-
stand him. T h e way that she does this is not just a female ruse
but springs from an in-depth understanding and love. Some of
the dialogues betw een th e two com e very near to genius. B ut
 R och ester reads h er shrewdly; he knows th at although she can
understand, she wiU. not act against h er principles, so he conceals
 the fact that he has a lunatic wife still very m uch alive and chooses
 bigamy instead. T h e m arriage is stopped at the last m om ent,
 and again Jane E y re gives no moral ju dgm ent and does not turn
 against Rochester. B u t she knows h er own limitations and that she
 cannot live if she betrays her own sense o f right and wrong; and
 just as she w ent beyond herself for the sake o f love, so now she
 overcom es h erself again for the sake o f h er principles. W hen I
 first read th e book, I thought her an inhuman prig, but later in life

     T h ere is a driving sincerity in the way Charlotte Bronte draws
 h er heroines that is in striking contrast to the rest of the con-
 ten t o f her books. These wom en are not able to break the Ten

 whole they keep their own sense of right and wrong without being

prigs. They know the passionate animal in themselves, and one
cannot doubt that they believe in its right to exist. O ne feels that
they say to it: 'W e are awfully sorry to have to repress you, but take
a look at the world we live in and how we w ere brought up; what
else can we do?” And what else could they do then in the Victorian
fige and in the outer world without destroying themselves entirely?
    I admit that I find it rather difficult to read Charlotte B ron tê’s
books. The end o f Ja n e E y re, for instance, has a sort o f virtuous
trium phant note that is quite unfounded and is actually irritating,
and it hints at the possibility that Charlotte, in spite o f h er infi-
nitely greater literary ability, had barely m ore o f an idea o f what
she was talking about than Anne. B u t all the sam e, consciously
and unconsciously, I think that she does make an exceedingly
positive contribution to the problem o f m odern woman. H er her-
oines are an honest attem pt to reconcile the truly conventional
woman with her primitive, impassioned sister, and one should not
allow oneself to be deceived by that Victorian moralizing white-
wash with which at times she tries to hide her genuine but, to her,
very disconcerting discoveries.

   “Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates and rears” might surely
have been w ritten by an old alchemist about the lapis stone.
     I f the work o f Em ily Bronte is really concerned with the prob­
lem o f th e stone, there is a hard task before us. Such a process lies
deep in the earth o f a book, and it is as difficult to extract as that
famous root o f the mandrake. The upper stratosphere, moreover,
is filled with brilliant opportunities o f the animus.
    W uthering Heights is of outstanding literary merit. The Irish
poet W. B. Yeats goes so far as to call it the greatest novel in the
English language. I am glad that a man has said this, because I

 care to back as a rival. Bits o f W uthering H eights rem ind m e of

      It is long— in fact, too long— and has a com plicated form which
 makes it exceedingly difficult to condense into a short synopsis.
 There are bewilderingly countless characters, and worst still, their

 tried to get over this difficulty by means of the following chart. 8
 The story is told by a Mr. Lockwood, a stranger from the south
 o f England, who has recently on “idle whim” rented Thrushcross
 Grange, a large and lonely place on the Yorkshire moors. H e goes
 over to visit his landlord and describes the house as follows:


          Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliffs dwelling.
          “Wuthering” being a significant provincial adjective, descrip-
          tive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed
          in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have
          up there at all times, indeed; one may guess the power of the
          north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of
          a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of
          gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving
          alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build
          it strong; the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and
          the comers defended with large jutting stones.9

    Mr. L o c^ ^ o od is w eather-bound for a night at the Heights by
a snow storm , and he reads som e old diaries and then dream s him ­
self into th e c e n te r o f th e pecu liar d ram a that involved the inhab­
itants o f Thrushcross G range and W uthering Heights through two
generations. At th e first gleam o f dawn, Mr. Lockw ood escapes
in te rro r from the naked emotions o f th e living and the dead at
W uthering H eights, but h e pays for his bad night floundering in
th e snow and becom ing ill. Then, while suffering a long illness,
Nelly D ean, th e childrens old nurse and present-day house-
k eeper at th e Thrushcross G range, tells him the rest o f the story.
    T h e story falls into two parts, and if we follow the alchemistic
analogy, w e might say that Em ily makes two attempts to throw
th e story into th e m elting pot and to produce the stone, that is, to
p rod u ce a totality o f the hum an personality.
    T he first o f these attem pts is the history o f Catherine Earnshaw
o f W uthering Heights. H er nurse, Nelly D ean, describes her as
“a wild, wicked slip” with spirits “always at high-water mark, her
tongue always going— singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody
who would not do th e sam e.” B ut Nelly D ean adds:


           A wild, wicked slip she was— but she had the bonniest eye,
           and sweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish; and, after
           all, I believe she meant no harm; for when once she made

     As Catherine grows up she becom es m ore and more torn by
 h er relationship to two of these people. First, Heathcliff, her
 adopted brother, a dark foundling who had been picked up in the

250               The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



streets o f Liverpool by old Mr. Earnshaw, C ath erin es father. And
second, E d gar Linton, th e fair but rath er weak and effeminate
hero of sorts, heir to Thrushcross Grange. Old Mr. Eam sh aw was
devoted to Heathcliff, which aroused the fierce jealousy o f his
own worthless son, Hindley, C atherines brother. H indley took
fa dire revenge upon his fathers death and degraded H eathcliff
 to the rank o f a ploughboy. Catherine, though convinced that
she is really wrong, marries E d g ar Linton. T he day she becom es
engaged, she confides in Nelly Dean:

       “If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable .
       . . . . I dreamt once that I was there . . . . heaven did not seem
       to be my home, and I broke my heart with weeping to come
       back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung
       me out into the middle of the heath on the top ofWuthering
       Heights, where I woke sobbing for joy . . . . Ive no more
       business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven;
       and if the wicked man [Hindley] in there had not brought
       Heathcliff so low, I shouldn’t have thought of it. It would
       degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know
       how I love him; and that, not because he’s handsome, Nelly,
       but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls
       are made of, his and mine are the same; and Lintons is as dif­
       ferent as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire . . . .
       My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will
       change it, I’m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love
       for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath— a source
       of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliffl
       He’s always, always in my mind—not as a pleasure, any more
       than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being/’11

This speech shows an amazing insight. Heathcliff, the penniless
foundling, so dark as to be open to the question o f black blood, is
recognized by Catherine as the m ost valuable thing: “m ore myself
than I am.”

   B ut in spite o f this insight, and a severe illness brought on by
the abrupt departure o f H eathcliff (who had overheard som e o f
h er conversation with Nelly D ean), she carries through with her
project. H eathcliff vanishes for three years, and when he returns,
C atherine is Mrs. Linton o f Thrushcross G range.
   T h ere is no trace o f Victorianism— or o f any age— in the
scenes that follow. T hey are a passionate and, one could say, tim e-
less attem pt to get down to the fundamentals o f human nature
. . . and especially o f feminine nature. C atherine had no idea of
giving up either' relationship; and it is really rem arkable that a
clergym ans daughter could achieve the objectivity with which
Em ily Bronte writes this part o f her novel. Conventions are never

ity), but w hereas C harlotte and Axine w ere always fussing and

the . rest, and they must stam p w h at th e y c a n a s th e ir own.
    Although Catherine is a Titan, th ere is too much weakness
within, t ^ fire o f the retort is too hot,. and she is unable to stand
the strain‘. In other words, Em ily draws h er on too generous and
too masculine lines. She is never cowardly, abject, envious, or
m ean, qualities which appear in her sister-in-law, Isabella Linton.
Isabella develops a foolish, unreal, schoolgirl Schwô^rmerei12
for H eathcliff, illusions which Catherine endeavors to dispel
(and h ere Nelly D ean adds that she seem ed to speak sincerely) .
and says:


      “Heathcliff is— an unreclaimed creature, without refine-
      ment, without cultivation; an arid wilderness of f urze and
      whinstone. I’d as soon put that little canary into the park on a
      winters day, as recommend you to bestow your heart on him!
      It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing
      else, which makes that dream enter your head. Pray, don’t
      imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affec-
      tion beneath a stem exterior! He’s not a rough diamond— a

            pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he’s a fierce, pitiless, wolf-
            ish man. I never say to him, ‘Let this or that enemy alone,
            because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them’; I say,
            ‘Let them alone, because I should hate them to be wronged’;
            and he’d crush you hke a sparrow’s egg, Isabella, if he found
/           you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn’t love a Linton,
            and yet he’d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and
            expectations—avarice is growing with him a besetting sin.
            There’s my picture; and I’m his friend— so much so, that had
            he thought seriously to catch you, I should, perhaps, have
            held my tongue, and let you fall into his trap . . . . Banish him
            from your thoughts . . . . He's a bird of bad omen: no mate
            for you.”13

   But Catherine speaks to deaf ears, so she turns h er attention to
Heathcliff. She forbids him to m arry Isabella and adds, “Abstract
your mind from the subject at present, you are too prone to covet
your neighbors goods; rem em b er this neighbors goods are m ine.”
She entirely forgets that it was she who first coveted the Linton
goods and that she was the original robber. N e llv D e a n . who

treats h er with incredible cruelty, saying himself: “I have no pity!

   W hen Catherine finds that H eathcliff will not obey h e r
regarding Isabella, and th a t h er w eak husband will really shut his
door against H eathcliff in consequence, she falls ill, always h er
refuge when crossed. She does this on purpose, but she is far too
frank about it. ( Catherine is always too frank.) After a scene with

   W hat has happened to the first quaternity? W hy are th ere only
broken pieces left? This quaternity seem s to have been form ed
around C atherine’s consciousness o f the value o f H eathcliff being
“m ore herself than she is.” Perhaps we could say that H eathcliff
was the inferior function, and that while C atherine held firmly to
this “most despised thing,” h er consciousness form ed a m agnetic
light that attracted the two auxiliary functions: Edgar Linton and
his sister Isabella. H eathcliff himself, who idolized C atherine
with the whole force o f his passionate nature, admits that “they
w ere full o f stupid adm iration” for her,, and Nelly D ean com pares
C atherine to a thorn tree and the two Lintons to honeysuckle
plants em bracing the tree. But when C atherine allowed the col­
lective point o f view to eclipse this consciousness, it fell into the
unconscious, and Isabella Linton, as shadow, imm ediately seized
upon it and pursued H eathcliff on h er own account. T h e individ­
ual effort had becom e the shadow plot, which naturally w recked
this first quaternity and th e initial attem pt at individuation.
    W e are now con cern ed with the second attem pt, with the
secon d quaternity, w hich I have underlined h ere in red. It is an
interesting fa c t-th at the heroine o f this p art o f the book is also
called Catherine, but it is exceedingly confusing from a practical
point o f view. She was, however, called “Cathy,” so I thought we
had b e tte r adopt this name in ord er to form a distinction from
h er mother, our original Catherine, whom we m eet again at the
en d o f the book.
    T he next chapters are concerned with the long childhood
o f Cathy Linton at Thrushcross Grange. This part o f the book,
254            The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women

     T he form o f W uthering H eights depends mainly on a network
o f interrelations. Looked at from the point o f view of cause and
effect, these seem to be haphazard and unaccountable, leading
only to a senseless cruelty, suffering, and loss o f life. But the
energic or final point o f view sheds m ore light upon them . The
conclusion o f the book then appears as a m agnet, drawing all o f
the threads together, and the story falls into a purposeful and
serene pattern.
    The counterm ovem ent, that is, H eathcliffs plan of revenge,
is seen most clearly when regarded from the point o f view o f
cause and effect. Already in his youth he works out how to pos-
sess all the property both o f his oppressor and “brother” Hindley
Earnshaw and o f his rival E dgar Linton, and as an adult he
faithfully adheres to this plan o f retribution. It is not essential
in so short a synopsis to describe H eath cliffs vengeance regard-
ing Hindley Earnshaw . It will suffice to say that C atherin es
daughter C athy Linton grows up, and H eathcliff becom es
the owner o f W uthering H eights, employing as his ploughboy
H areton Earnshaw, Hindleys son. (And on ce again retribution
is achieved.) Isabella dies, and h er son, Linton Heathcliff, also
com es to live at W uthering Heights.
   Heathcliff now turns his attention to working out his retri­
bution on E d gar Linton. H e could not, however, have carried
through with this plan had it not been for Cathy Linton’s plot.
She played into his hands again and again. T he chapters which
begin with her adolescence are an excellent picture o f the way the
animus seizes on the threads o f a wom an’s plot and wea ves them
into his plan. H e knows his goal while h er purpose is unconscious;
he follows a settled pattern, she a rom antic inclination.

com plicated by th e incredible cruelties o f Heathcliff, b u m her
day and night as she chafes against h er im prisonment and depen-
dence. H ad she followed in her m others footsteps, she might
have escaped by marrying the rich Mr. Lockwood, who was now
tenant of th e G range. But, one could say, she remains voluntarily
in the retort; and slowly the childishness and rebellion are burnt
away and she accepts h er all but intolerable fate.
     H er cousin, H areton Earnshaw, Hindley’s son, is still living at
 the Heights and working for H eathcliff as a farmhand. H eathcliff
 256                The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Troth in Women



himself, speaking to Nelly D ean, says: “H areton is gold put to the
use o f paving stones.” And, in h er new attitude of acceptance,
Cathy discovers the gold under the ignorance and boorishness
that had hopelessly repelled her before. She sets herself the task
o f educating H areton and o f liberating him from his burden of
;inferiority and ignorance. But when H eathcliff becom es aware of
 this, he says to her: “I f I see H areton Earnshaw listen to you, I’U
 send him to beg his bread where he can get it. Your love will make
him an outcast and a beggar.”

 Heathcliff says:

       “And I pray one prayer—I repeat it till my tongue stiffens—
       Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living!
       You said I killed you—haunt me, then! The murdered do
       haunt their murderers. I believe— I know that ghosts have
       wandered on earth. Be with me always— take any form—
       drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I
       cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I cannot live
       without my life! I cannot live without my soul!”15

This prayer is now granted, and C atherine, always in the back-
ground, draws H eathcliffs interest entirely away from all material
things. H e says to Nelly Dean:


       “An absurd termination to my violent exertions? . . . My
       old enemies have not beaten me; now would be the precise
       time to revenge myself on their representatives— I could do
       it, and none could hinder me. But where is the use? I don’t
       care for striking, I can’t take the trouble to raise my hand!
       That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole time, only
       to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. It is far from being the

         case— I have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction,
         and I am too idle to destroy for nothing.”16

     W h at has happened h e re ? W hy has H eathcliff lost his wish to
destroy? H e has, as h e him self says, “ . . . ground with the greater
energy in proportion to the increase o f pain.” Perh aps-w^-could

    C atherine’s sin has evidently been redeem ed. W e saw that she
allowed the collective point of view to overcom e her, but what
then has Cathy’s attitude b een toward H eathcliff? H e him self says
to her: “To you I have been worse than the devil.” W hen Cathy
m arries Linton, the son o f H eathcliff and Isabella, and goes to
live at W uthering Heights, Nelly D ean reports with horror: “She
seem ed to make up h er mind to en ter into the spirit of h er ffuure
family and to draw pleasure from the griefs of h er enem ies.”
This is an unusually intelligent attitude. F o r as we know, the
b est way o f understanding anything is to find the corresponding
place in yourself. She carries this attitude a step further through
h er love for H areton Earnshaw. H areton had been brought up
by H eathcliff and had never questioned his position. Cathy was
anxious to enlighten him, but he tells h er that he “will not suf-
fer a word to be uttered in H eathcliffs disparagement, it does
not signify [that] if he w ere the devil, he [H areton] would stand
by him .” And Nelly D ean adds: “I don’t believe Cathy has ever
b reath ed a syllable in H areton's hearing against h er oppressor

since.” H areton is a sort o f Parsifal figure, beyond the opposites,
the stone which does not know it is the stone. It is through him
that Cathy learns to see the positive side o f Heathcliff.

lands are thus restored to their hereditary owners, th e opposites
o f H eathcliff and C atherine are united in the beyond in the
unconscious, and the opposites o f H areton and Cathy are united
on earth in consciousness.
   This is an individuation process which takes place in the
unconscious, a state clearly found in a verse o f Em ily B ron tes
poem , “My C om forter”:


         So stood I, in Heavens glorious sun,
             And in the glare of Hell;
         My spirit drank a mingled tone,
        Of seraph’s song, and demon’s moan;
        What my soul ^ r e , my soul alone
                Within itself may tell!18


The opposites tear her soul, her psyche apart. It is not happen-
ing to her conscious but to her unconscious personality. Thus we
are forced to the conclusion that Em ily Bronte herself had no
idea o f the psychological significance o f what she had written in
W uthering Heights, but rather that the story was written, so to
speak, through her and not by her.
   In conclusion I should like to quote a short extract from Charlotte
Brontes “Biographical N otice” o f her sister, Emily, because I think
it well shows that such a process,- even when entirely unconscious,
must be dimly reflected in the conscious personality:


       The details of her illness are deep-branded in my memoty,
       but to dwell on them, either in thought or narrative, is not
       in my power. Never in all her life had she lingered over any
18. B r o n te , The Complete Poems, p. 3 0 .

         task that lay before her, and she did not linger now. She sank
         rapidly. She made haste to leave us. Yet, while physically she
         perished, mentally she grew stronger than we had yet known
         her. Day by day, when I saw with what a front she met suf­
         fering, I looked on her with an anguish of wonder and love.
         I have seen nothing like it; but, indeed, I have never seen
         her parallel in anything. Stronger than a man, simpler than a
         child, her nature stood alone.19

W hen I first considered the enormous am ount of material which
lies at our disposal when speaking o f the Bronte family, and then
o f the vast field of Jungian psychology, I frankly own that I bit-
terly regretted my foolhardiness in venturing to say anything of
the form er from the standpoint o f the latter in so short a space.
However, having com m itted m yself to this venture, I will attem pt
to limit the field to one single aspect in order to reduce the risk
o f getting lost in our material.

      Perhapsthe-m ostinteresting-aspect-o£the-Brontes__from -the
 standpoint of Jungian psychology is th eir relation to the collec-
-tive unconscious, G erhard Adler recently pointed out that “the
concepts of the collective unconscious and the archetypes are still
open to considerable misunderstanding.”1 The readers of these
jEuild pamphlets are probably familiar with these term s, so I will
only briefly rem ind them that the term collective unconscious
refers to the com m on foundation o f th e psyche below all per­
sonal differences or repressed material. In “Analytical Psychology
and W eltanschauung,” Jung says that it is “the mighty deposit of
ancestral experience accum ulated over millions of years.”2 And
further: “The unconscious is not m erely conditioned by history,
but is the very source of the creative im pulse.”3 Jung has com ­
pared the archetypes to the “axial system which determ ines only
the . . . structure but not the con crete form of the individual
crystal.”4 The archetypes have no m aterial existence of their own
but are the great formative influences in hum an fate. The arche-
type itself is beyond our com prehension, but we can apprehend
its reality by the images and symbols which it produces. The
collective unconscious is the sum total o f all the archetypes and
therefore the basic structure of all our psychic reactions.
    My particular interest in the Bronte material is that it comes
from the psychology of women and thus gives us an exceptional
opportunity to study the collective unconscious as it appears in
feminine psychology.5 Jung’s concept o f the animus, that.is, the

writes: “This book is not fit to be in the hands o f everybody, for it
is necessary to correct the language in som e places and explain it
in others.” W ithout criticizing this attitude, I should like to point
out that it gives a one-sided picture, the whole emphasis being set
C/fi the light while the shadow is missing.
     W e m eet with the reverse of this picture in another field full o f
valuable material, namely, the history o f witches. This material has
again been edited by the Inquisitors and others so that in this case
it is often only the dark that has been left to us. To a certain extent
this was no doubt deserved, but it is obvious that it lowers the value
o f the material from the standpoint o f the m odem psychologist.
   W ith the Brontes, on the other hand, there has been little or
no such editing. No enthusiastic biographer could explain away

    Subsistence farming o f a few acres along with “take-in” from
the moors was com bined with hand-loom weaving or wool com b-
ing. This dom estic system o f w orsted m anufacture was changing to
factory production with w ater-pow ered machinery. The mills built
from 1 7 9 0 along the river w ere well established when the Bronte
family arrived. O ther occupations included quarrying and building
and crafts, but' th ere w ere few professional people. Baptist and
W esleyan chapels flourished, and together with the church, pro-
vided the village with education and a focus for social life.
    Gaskell further notes that there w ere no sewers; the w ater sup-
ply, polluted and inadequate, contributed to a high mortality rate.
T h ere w ere 1 ,3 4 4 burials in the churchyard betw een 1 8 4 0 and
185 0 and the average age at death was twenty-five years.11 Against
these m ortality figures, the Bronte deaths w ere unremarkable.
   During the Bronte period, Haworth was a crowded industrial
township located not far from the p resent city of Leeds. The
population doubled betw een 1801 and 1851 to some 3 ,4 0 0 souls.
T h ere the Reverend Patrick Bronte served as curate from 1820
until his death in 1861, outliving his wife and all o f his children,
and th ere his extraordinary daughters and son lived and died.
Their mother, Maria, passed away in 182 1; little is known of
h er life. T he children’s m other died o f ca n ce r when the eldest
child, Maria, was only eight years old. This event is o f th e utm ost
im portance, for the children lacked th e m aternal earth th at is
indispensable for providing a rooted existence in the ou ter world.
T herefore their father was the dom inant figure in their lives and
was an influence that can hardly be overestim ated. His wild Irish
tem p eram en t can never have fitted very smoothly into his par-
son’s coat, to which his well-known habit o f firing pistols out o f
the back door (or, in oth er versions, his bedroom window) bears
witness. And in his later years, C harlotte could always drive out
his bad moods and depressions by describing the strange weap-

ons at the London armory. In a discussion in Zürich not long ago,
Jung em phasized that the child whose parents failed in develop-
ing their creative side has to carry a particularly heavy burden. I
own that I suspect both the Bronte parents o f having com m itted
this "sin” against their children. Old Mr. B ronte w rote poems,
put he seems to have taken little trouble to develop this side of
himself. Charlotte was immensely struck by h er m oth ers letters,
written to Mr. Bronte during their engagem ent. Moreover, Mrs.
Bronte wrote an essay on "The Advantage o f Poverty in Religious
C oncerns,” which was first published som e eighty years after
h er death (unfortunately I have not yet been able to get hold o f
this docum ent). 12
    At all events, an urge to express themselves by drawing or
writing certainly took possession o f all four children who sur-
vived, an urge that expressed itself at an awfully early age. Jung
has d ra^n attention in many places to the fact that children
pass the first years of their lives am ong the images of the col­
lective unconscious (see, for exam ple, his sem inar on children’s
dream s).13 W e find the sam e idea in oth er places, for instance,
in W ordsw orths "Intimations of Im m ortality.”14 This poem con-
tains a description— founded, as the poet says, on recollections
of his own childhood— o f the very process that Jung describes

of Maria Bronte s religious thinking in the apparently unpublished manuscript of her
somewhat severe essay on “The Advantage of Poverty in Religious Concerns,” which finds
spiritual gain in material loss. Their mother writes: “What is poverty . . . Nothing—or rather
a something which, with the assistance, and blessing of our Gracious Master, will greatly
promote our spiritual welfare, and tend to increase, and strengthen our efforts to gain

in m ore scientific language as leaving the images o f the collec­
tive unconscious in ord er to grow up into the adult duties o f the
outside world.
   T he little Bronte girls— left mainly to their own devices after
their m oth ers death— lived almost entirely among the images
o f the collective unconscious. One o f their greatest pleasures
was roam ing about the moors, which seem ed to them , as to
W ordsworth, “apparell’d in celestial light, th e glory and the
freshness of a dream .” They lived, as is well lmown, in an imagi-
nary world of their own. 15 They lived in this world together and
strengthened each other in remaining with the collective images
long after th e age that other children have forgotten all about
them in the excitem ent o f gam es, school, and so on. All readers of
the early works o f the Brontes know that Charlotte and Branwell
shared a life in Angria until after they w ere grown up. Em ily and
Anne w ent on still longer with the so-called “Gondal C hronicles.”
T here are references in both Em ily’s and A nnes “birthday notes,”
written in 18 4 5 , showing that they w ere still sharing a life in
Gondal at that tim e, namely, a few years before their early ^ a th s .
    The writing career o f the Brontes began when they w ere chil­
dren in th e composition o f miniature books entailing volumes of
tales and adventures closely transcribed in tiny handwriting so
as to be illegible to their aunt and father. It was only Em ily who
maintained this script into h er adult years, a minute, cram ped
hand readable practically only w th a magnifying glass, a script
that signaled the private world of Gondal. Gondal was the imagi-
nary realm o f desire, adventure, and struggle that Em ily invented
as a child with h er sister Anne and that she preserved as a narra-
tive and poetic framework into her adult work. In contrast to the
other, m ale-dom inated imaginary worlds invented by the young
Brontes, Gondal was a world ruled by powerful and treacherous
female figures. The “Gondal Chronicles”— prose stories com -
posed by Em ily and Anne as the narrative o f the saga— are now
unfortunately lost, but the poem s survive.16

   This continued connection with the figures o f the collective
unconscious was indeed their greatest pleasure and is perhaps the
main reason for the extraordinary interest o f the m aterial from
the standpoint o f Jungian psychology. B u t from the point o f view
of the Brontes them selves, it also represented a great danger.
/ T h ere is a so-called “dream -story” o f C h arlottes th at depicts
 their position vividly. I am not sure o f its date, but this frag-
 m ent certainly belongs to h er juvenile period and, from internal
evidence, m ust have been founded on an actual dream . She
writes that she was in the “Mines o f C racon e,” under th e floor
o f the sea.


       But in the midst of all this magnificence I felt an indescrib-
       able sense of fear and terror, for the sea raged above us, and
       by the awful and tumultuous noises of roaring winds and
       dashing waves, it seemed as if the storm was violent. And now
       the massy pillars groaned beneath the pressure of the ocean,
       and the glittering arches seemed about to be overwhelmed.
       When I heard the rushing waters and saw a mighty flood roll-
       ing towards me I gave a loud shriek of terror.”
           The dream changes: I am in a desert full of barren rocks
       and high mountains, where I see “by the light of his own fiery
       eyes a royal lion rousing himself from his kingly slumbers.
       His terrible eye was fixed upon me, and the desert rang, and
       the rocks echoed with the tremendous roar of fierce delight
       which he uttered as he sprang towards me.”17

      The first p art o f this dream story gives a vivid picture o f the
situation that Jung describes as the danger o f being overwhelmed
by the collective unconscious of which the sea is one o f the most
frequent symbols. O f all the “perils o f th e soul,” this is the greatest
one that confronts our weak ego-consciousness. W hen the collec­
tive unconscious breaks in and com pletely submerges conscious­
ness, the result is, as a rule, psychosis or death.

  W e see from this dream picture the enormous danger to
which the Brontes w ere exposed. Charlotte does not even have an
island to stand on, she is under the sea, and the roof is groaning
under the weight of th e waters. It even seems to have given way
som ew here, for she hears the roiling waters and sees a mighty
flood advancing tow ard her. As often happens in dream s, when
an impossible impasse is reach ed , then th ere is an enantiodromia,
that is, the situation turns into its own opposite.
   T he desert is indeed another symbol o f the collective uncon­
scious, and the lion is rushing tow ard h er as the waves w ere
before. But the situation has b ecom e m ore differentiated. Instead
o f being u n d e r the sea, she is on the earth. And whereas the waves
represent th e totality o f th e unconscious, the lion is already a dif­
ferentiated symbol o r im age. In analyzing a similar dream in his
sem inar on children’s dream s, Jung calls the lion the im age o f the
instinctive life in a particularly fiery form that cannot possibly be
controlled by the child.18 T he goddess Kali has teeth like a beast
o f prey and is often represented as riding on a lion. T he lion rep­
resents th e m onth o f August in the zodiac when all vegetation is
burnt up by the sun, a symbol em phasized in C harlottes dream
by th e desert. 19
    Mrs. Gaskell tells us that “Charlotte w atched over h er younger
sisters with the jealous vigilance o f som e wild creature that chang­
es h er very nature if danger threatens h er young. ”20 The death of
h er m other and then o f h er two elder sisters left Charlotte, at the
age o f nine, in the impossible role o f being a m other when she
had hardly experienced having a m oth er herself. It is no wonder
that h er instinctive life would take on such a threatening form. In
the second, som ew hat m ore positive dream picture, we see that a
situation o f the utm ost danger is again portrayed. T he lion roars
indeed with fierce delight, but we are left in doubt as to w hether
this is a roar o f w elcom e or one o f joy when spotting a providen-

tial meal appearing in the arid desert. And nothing seem s to be
provided for the dream er but the desert; no food, no shade, and
no companionship.
    This dream actually foreshadows C h arlottes whole fate: She
will either be overwhelmed by the waves o f the unconscious or
^ e must m eet the wild passionate animal in herself, as helpless as
a child, with h er b are hands. And like th e hero in the myths, she
finds herself cu t off from hum an companionship as in a desert. It
is a grim and appalling choice. H er life tells us that she chose the
latter alternative and paid the full price.
    I think we can take this dream o f C h arlottes as depicting not
only her own situation but also, to a great extent, that of h er broth­
er and sisters. At any rate, w e shall not go far wrong if we assume
that they w ere all in a situation w here th e sea o f the unconscious
might close over them at any time. W e g et hints o f this danger in
their books. I m ention, for instance, th e first Mrs. R och ester in
Ja n e E y r e who was a lunatic with a frenzied determ ination to set
the house on fire, suggesting here a wild, passionate nature p re-
figured in the roaring lion. This figure is also foreshadowed in h er
earlier writings. T he elder C atherine in W uthering H eights also
had fits o f frenzy, and it was in part C h arlottes unstable mental
health that brought about an early death. Fortunately the healthy
elem ents in the books predom inate as they did in the Bronte
wom en themselves.

her whole energy to pour into a love affair. W hen this cam e to a
rath er bad conclusion, it looked as if an earlier suicidal tendency
m ight reassert itself beyond control. B ut fortunately, it was the
creative spirit that reasserted itself, and she painted a long and
amazingly interesting series o f pictures based on visions and
dream s quite unlike her form er work. O f course she suffered a
great deal, but at least it kept her afloat during the worst tim e of
readjustm ent . . . to say nothing o f the psychoanalytic value o f the
pictures them selves.

W e can learn a similar lesson from the fate o f Branwell.21 H e was
regarded as the m ost gifted, as the very genius of the family. This
gift and this conviction w ere his misfortune, for it is very difficult
to live up to such expectations.
    Branwell B ronte was the fourth o f the six Bronte children. As
th e only Bronte son, Branwell was slated to be successful and pro-
vide support for his sisters. H e was a nftural scholar yet received
no formal education, although he was tutored in the classics by
his father. Branwell also received painting lessons, and in 1838 he
set out to be a portrait painter. H e indulged in the composition
o f Gondal stories with his sisters, produced several volumes of his
own work, and also enjoyed writing with Charlotte. O f a similarly
gifted psychic disposition as his sisters— and a poet as well— his
path in life was m ore hapless. H e becam e prone to indulgence
in alcohol and opium, was dismissed from one position after the
next, and am assed considerable debts. After a lengthy period of
mental decline, he died o f chronic bronchitis and pulmonary
tuberculosis at the age o f thirty-one.
    But his real trouble seems to have been that he— unlike his
sisters— was somewhat lazy and self-indulgent. Carlyle defined
genius in Frederick the Great as an “infinite capacity for taking
trouble,” and such an attitude is certainly th e best defense against

21. See Victor A, Neufeldt, The Works o f Patrick Branwell Bronte, vol. 1 (New York: Garland
Publishing, 1997).
272               The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



the invasion o f the dem onic side o f the creative urge. Branwell
undoubtedly lacked this defense, perhaps because th e loss of
his m other— bad as it was for the girls— was possibly even more
disastrous for him. Jung has pointed out that men can usually
 w eather disasters that com e from the outside world b etter than
,women, but that m en m ore often fall victim to moods which com e
 from within. This is indeed obvious in th e very term s anim a and
 anim us. The interm ediary figure betw een a m an and th e collec-
tive unconscious is feminine, naturally a frailer figure than the
masculine counterpart in women. M oreover, the anima in her
role o f Maya, the world, is always trying to entangle a man in the
outside world, whereas the animus tries to cu t a woman out o f her
natural eras entanglements with h er environment and to direct
her attention to the inner world and to th e animus himself.
   W hereas the animus, particularly in the case o f Emily, proved
a strong bulwark against the waves o f the threatening collec­
tive unconscious, the anima, in the case o f Branwell, apparently
attem pted to solve the problem according to h er nature by entan-
gling him in the world. She eventually becam e projected onto
Mrs. Robinson, the wife o f his employer. Mrs. Robinson was a
woman who, incapable o f carrying the projection, took it per-
sonally. 22 Not that one can judge her for that, but still there have
been women who— although they knew no psychology— have
somehow instinctively realized that they w ere a m ere transitory
vessel and that it was the young m an’s soul that was at stake. I
rem ind the reader, for instance, o f B ernard Shaw’s Candida, who
played this role to perfection in the case of young Marchbank.
And in real life, o f M adam e Berny, who was so helpful to the
young Balzac in this resp ect.23

22. [Barbara Hannah notes: When the anima; the feminine soul of man, is not realized as a
psychic reality, the whole magic and fascination of the archetype usually appears projected
onto some real woman. The attraction of the latter thus becomes irresistible to the man, for
she is not only a woman but becomes a goddess in his eyes. And also: It is evident that if a
woman such as Mrs. Robinson could see that a young man such as Branwell was at bottom
in search of his own soul, she would be in a much stronger position and more capable of
dealing with the situation. Unfortunately vanity can be a great misleader in this respect. Ed.]
23. [The French novelist Honore de Balzac (1799-1859) met Laure de Berny in 1821
when he gave lessons to her son. Laure was twenty-three years older than Balzac. Their

    In order to deal with the outside world at all, a man needs
roots, and h ere Branwell was probably hopelessly handicapped
from the start. A verse in one o f his poem s gives us perhaps
the key:


       And often has my mother said,
       ^While on her lap I laid my head,
       She feared for time I was not made,
       But for etemity.24

    T he first carrier of the anima figure for m en ;is naturally the
m other, and this aspect o f Branwells anima seems to have fol­
lowed his actual m other into the beyond so that one might almost
say he had had little chance from the beginning. I must own that
my interest in Branwell is o f rather recen t date, but I think he
would be worth further study from the point o f view of the dif­
feren t reactions o f the animus and anima to the circumstances
involving the collective unconscious.25



                        ANNE B r o n t e (1 8 2 0 -1 8 4 9 )
T h e animus, as the spirit o f the unconscious mind of wom an, is
characterized by opinions that naturally go beside the m ark and
which are, as Jung has often pointed out, peculiarly irritating,
especially to a man. Like every other manifestation of the uncon-
scious, this exceedingly negative m echanism has also its positive
side, for these readym ade opinions som etim es catch up the m ani­
festation of the unconscious and prevent it from sweeping away a
too weak consciousness. W e can observe a typical reaction o f the
animus to the threatening waves o f the unconscious in the case

liaison—considered by some to be outrageous—lasted some twelve years. Laure freed
young Balzac from his oppressing family and inspired, encouraged, and supported him with
the writing of his novels. Barbara Hannah notes that she owes this reference from a lecture
on Balzac to Aniela Jaffé. Ed. ]

o f Anne.26 He built, as it w ere, a wall o f opinions around her and
caught the dual, paradoxical nature of th e unconscious in a net,
w here he sorted it out into right and wrong, you should or you
 shouldn’t, and so on before he allowed it to actually approach her.
 In contrast to her sisters, her books contain little of the collective
/unconscious p er se. W e cannot learn m uch of direct value to our
 them e from them and, as they contain next to nothing o f the magic
o f the unconscious, they would probably have been long forgotten
w ere it not for the connection to h er sisters. All th e same, they
 are o f im m ense indirect value to our them e, and, like Branwell,
 they might well b e worth further investigation. Another point
 about Anne that should not be overlooked is that she must have
 been an im m ense com fort to h er m ore brilliant sisters. Emily,
 in particular, undoubtedly owed a great deal to Anne’s unfailing
 patience and tact. One m ore or less com m onplace m em ber was
 really a necessity to such an unusually gifted family.

 to bl:l. the, only Bronte who made. a.real and. su stam ed .effort.to
 m eet the fJood.of images from the unconscious. She had at least
 two friends outside the family, Ellen Nussey (a lifelong friend)
 and Mary Taylor, both o f whom m eant a great deal to her. H er
 strong tie to her father made her relationship to the male sex
 problematical, and she seem s to have developed remarkable ani­
 mus opinions in this respect. Mrs. Gaskell tells us that she never
 got over an idee fix e that she was exceedingly ugly and unattract-
 ive. Charlotte once said to her: “I notice that after a stranger has
 once looked at my face, he is careful not to let his eyes wander
 to that part o f the room again!” Mrs. Gaskell evidently did her
 best to show her that this was sheer nonsense, but soon she had
 to acknowledge her im potence against such an animus opinion
 (although, o f course, she did not call it by this name).

   U nfortunately w e can only touch on a few points in C h arlo ttes
life. T h e tie to h er father and to th e countryside around
H aw orth acted as a m agnet during h e r m any flights o u t into
the world. H e r h eroines, Jane E y re and L u cy Snowe, both o f
whom , interestingly enough, a re d ep icted as alone in th e world
with no hom e ties, give us som e idea o f how C harlotte would
have m et the world had it not b een for th e lure of h e r hom e.
Jan e E y re , with h er passionate n atu re and h er im m ensely strong
and genuine sense o f morality, gives us perhaps the b est idea of
the fight which C h arlotte m ust have m aintained against the lion
o f h er earlier dream in his passionate, instinctive aspect. As has
often b een pointed out, the creation o f Jane E y re h erself was
a startling innovation in early V ictorian days, w hen passion was
only associated in literature with so-called “fallen w om en,” to say
nothing o f the role which passion plays in m any o f C h arlo ttes
early writings.

      Why I did cast the world away.


      Why I have persevered to shun
      The common paths that others run,
      And on a strange road journeyed on,
      Heedless, alike, of wealth and power—
      Of glory’s wreath and pleasure’s flpwer.


      These, once, indeed, seemed Beings Divine;
      And they, perchance, heard vows of mine,
      And saw my offerings on their shrine;
      But, careless gifts are seldom pm;ed,
      And mine were worthily despised.


      So, with a ready heart I swore
      To seek their altar-stone no more;
      And gave my spirit to adore
      Thee, ever-present, phantom thing;
      My slave, my comrade, and my king,


      A slave, because I rule thee still;
      Incline thee to my changeful will,
      And make thy influence good or ill:

        A comrade, for by day and night
        Thou art my intimate delight,—

        My darling pain that wounds and sears
        And wrings a blessing out from tears
        By deadening me to earthly cares;
        And yet, a king, though Prudence well
        Have taught thy subject to rebel.

        And am I wrong to worship, where
        Faith cannot doubt, nor hope despair,
        Since my own soul can grant my prayer?
        Speak, God of visions.. plead for me,

the forerunner of some apparition, an incident that actually hap­
pened to Charlotte when she was about eighteen while working as
a teach er at Roe Head School. Subsequently, Charlotte suffered a
terrible depression o f her spirits. As late as 1 853— two years prior

to h er death— Charlotte stopped Mrs. Gaskell, who was going to
 relate a ghost story, and told her that she was unable to control the
 thoughts of ominous gloom that such stories suggested to her. 30
    These incidents are enough to show us that Charlotte— unlike
 Em ily— was alarm ed at the slightest suggestion of autonomous
/activity on the part of the unconscious. I f we com pare C harlottes
 attitude here with that o f H eathcliff toward the ghost of Catherine
 Earnshaw in Em ily’s W uthering H eights, we may perhaps assume
 that there was a fundamental difference between the two sisters in
 this respect. Charlotte certainly loved h er imaginary world quite
 as much as Emily, but whereas the latter w atched and recorded
 with an amazing objectivity, it seems to me that Charlotte was
 much m ore inclined to take over the role of stage m anager and to
 keep her figures as m uch as possible under control. The fact that
 she so often recreated Branwells figures in their early writings
 seems to point in the same direction.
      There is, however, no doubt that the unconscious played a great
 role in the composition of C harlottes books. Mrs. Gaskell even lik-
 ens C harlottes state when she wrote to that of one o f “possession.”
 She adds, however, that Charlotte never allowed this condition to
 interfere with her daily duties and would always interrupt it for
 any outside call.31 W e see here that Charlotte had strengthened
 h er walls against the threatening waves of the unconscious by
 forcing herself to regard the calls of the outer world as the greater
 reality of the two. The creative spirit was allowed to approach
 h er— a fragment written at Roe Hill tells us that his visits were
 her greatest pleasure— but even he had to modulate his visits to
 suit oth er demands. M oreover, she m et and curbed him m ore and
 m ore with an uncompromising sense o f reality. She says herself in
 the preface to The Professor: “I _have got over any such taste as I
 might once have had for ornamental and redundant composition
 and com e to prefer what is plain and homely. ”
    This “plain and homely” com m on sense in Charlotte was her
 most valuable defense against being swept away by h er genius.

W e can w atch it getting stronger and stronger throughout her
works. F o r instance, in Ja n e E y re one feels that it just holds its
ground, w hereas in Villette it is definitely gaining the upper hand.
I f C harlotte had lived longer and had rem ained under the influ-
ence o f the Reverend A rthur Bell Nicholls, I w onder w hether it
m ight not have got too strong and thus excluded the m agic of the
unconscious which gives her books th eir g reat fascination. 32 H er
rath er peculiar lack of appreciation o f Jane A usten looks alm ost as
if she felt some danger in this resp ect herself, for what was right
for the genius o f a Jane Austen would have been a prison to the
m ore elem ental genius o f a B ro n te .33 B u t as Jung often says, there
is no profit in considering what would have happened had the old
Rom ans known the use of gunpowder!
    Fannie R atchford writes:

       It has become the fashion to exalt Emily and debase
       Charlotte, in utter ignorance that their genius— the ability
       to realize the imaginative with the vivid intensity of the actu-
       al—was identical, and that Emilys one point of superiority
       was her full surrender to the creative spirit which Charlotte
       fought with all the strength of her tyrannical conscience.34
32 . [The Rev. Arthur BeU. Nicholls, who was serang s curate (assistant cler^ ^ an) of Haworth
as of 1845, proposed marriage to Charlotte in 1852. The Rev. Patrick Bronte objected strongly,
and Charlotte, who was not in love, refused him. Nicholls left Haworth in the following year,
the same in which Charlotte’s Villette was published. By 1854, however, Mr. Bronte s opposi-
tion to the proposed marriage had weakened, and Charlotte and Nichols became engaged.
Nicholls retam ed as curate at Haworth, and they were married, although Charlotte apparently
admired but s ^ did not love him. David Cody, assistant professor of English at Hartwick
College, notes that Charlotte then caught pneumonia in 1854 while expecting a child. He
proposes tliat it was an illness that could have been cured, but she seems consciously or un­
consciously to have taken this opportunity to end her life; she died after a lengfry and painful
illness, possibly of dehydration. See www.victorianweb.or^authorsfàrontê/cbronté. Ed.]
33. [Jane Austen's style is delightful, playful, epigrammatic, terse, sagacious, witty, and of­
ten paradoxical, but it is dedicated to the goings-on of outer reality to such an extent that
she practically excludes the unconscious altogether. One can say that every sentence of her
work focuses on a brilliant rendition o f everyday experience. Any departure from worldly
reality, such as seen in the figures of Darcy and Elizabeth in PHde and Prejudice, can be
accounted for by Austen’s personal lack of understanding of male-female relationships and
need not necessarily be ascribed to inspiration tapped from the invisible realms o f the collec­
tive unconscious. See Barbara Hannahs discussion of the works of Jane Austen in her essay,
“Animus Figures in Literature and in Modem Life” in this volume. Ed.]

    While fully agreeing with Miss Ratchford, I should like to sug-
 gest that C harlottes lack o f “full surrender” was also motivated by
 a well-founded fear of being subm erged by the flood of figures that
 w ere always pressing in upon her from the collective unconscious,
 and that it was likewise conditioned by h er character. W hereas
/E m ily was aloof and willing to “live and let live,” Charlotte clearly
 liked to control h er environment as m uch as possible, particularly
 her younger sisters and brother, whom she also had to mother.



                         E m i l y B r o n t e ( 1 8 1 8 -1 8 4 8 )
 W e now com e to Emily, of whom we know the least of all.
 Charlotte destroyed almost all o f Em ily’s writings, and Emily, who
 was exceedingly reserved, apparently had no friends outside the
 family. 35 H er life at Haworth did indeed give h er a firm— if but
 tiny— piece o f ground, and all o f her roots w ere there. She adored
 the moors and kept a certain projected relationship to nature and
 her own instincts through her walks and many animal friends.
 Charlbtte tells us that although she had a benevolent interest in
 her neighbors at Haworth, she avoided them , observing them
 only from afar. She must have been tiresom ely opinionated when
 obliged to deal with the outside world. I m ention only h er habit
 o f wearing the hideous gigot sleeves long after they w ere out of
 fashion.36 And she refused to alter her opinion about some railway
 shares— although Charlotte had obtained expert advice— which
 eventually led to financial loss (although not until after h er death).

 35. [Barbara Hannah notes, in Striving Towards W holeness, that Emily was extremely intro-
 verted (p. 193). Mrs. Gaskell, however, notes that Charlotte was shy whereas Emily extreme­
 ly reserved. “I distinguish reserve from shyness, because I imagine shyness would please if
 it knew how; whereas reserve is indifferent whether it pleases or not” (Gaskell, The L ife o f
 Charlotte Bronte, p. 99). Barbara Hannah notes that after the appearance o f Wuthering
 Heights there was a rumor mruntained that the book had been written by Branwell on the
 premise that no woman who had lived such a circumscribed life could have written such a
 passionate story. Ed.]
 36. [Gigot or “leg of mutton” sleeves, in fashion in the 1820s and 1830s, were puffed sleeves,
 appearing somewhat in the form o f a leg o f lamb; narrow at the wrist and wide at the top,
 finely pleated into a low, off-thé-shoulder armhole with a strip of gathered glazed cotton;
 they sometimes had whalebone, stuffed pads, or even hoops at the edge, which held the
 sleeves out on the arms. Ed.]
                             Victi^ms o f the Creative Spirit



  Em ily was always an enigma to Charlotte, a fascinating enig­
ma, clothed with all th e magic of the world o f the unconscious.
Mrs. Gaskell was o f th e impression that “Em ily must have been a
rem nant o f the Titans, a great-grand daughter of the giants who
used to inhabit the earth .” Mrs. Gaskell can be seen here as telling
us that Em ily rem ained in the a rch e ^ p a l world. It would hardly
be going too far to say that Em ily was never really born into the
outer world at all. In fact, Em ily tells us as m uch herself in the
first lines of some o f h er best-known “Stanzas”:

        Often rebuked, yet always back retuming
            To those first feelings that were born with me,
        And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning
             For idle dreams of things which cannot be.37

    H ere we see the exact reverse o f C harlottes efforts to m eet the
flood o f the images of the collective unconscious by building up
defenses against them in the outer world. Em ily refused to enter
the “shades o f the prison house” which “begin to close on th e grow-
ing boy” as W ordsworth expresses it in his poem “Intimations.” She
simply remained where she was. In h er lines beginning, “Tell me,
tell m e, smiling child,” she sees the future of the child:


        Tell me tell me smiling child
        What the past is like to thee?
        An Autumn evening soft and mild
        With a wind that sighs moumfully

        Tell me what is the present hour?
        A green and flowery spray
        Where a young bird sits gathering its power
        To mount and fly away

        And what is the future, happy one?
        A sea beneath a cloudless sun

             A mighty glorious dazzling sea
             Stretching into infini^8

  If we com pare this image with th eth reaten in g sea in C h a rlo tte s
  early dream, we get another valuable hint as to th e differeJJ.ce_.in
/ attitude betw een the two sisters. Em ily’s attitude was m uch more
  fruitful from our point o f view, for she brings her m aterial from
  the collective unconscious in a far m ore com plete form than her
  sisters. But, from her own point of view, it was m uch too optimis-
  tic. It is extraordinary that, under such abnormal conditions, she
  kept her sanity and, even to a great extent, her physical health
  until she was twenty-nine. She can only have achieved this by
  limiting h er ou ter field as m uch as possible to Haworth and by
  remaining am ong things and people who w ere m ore or less in
  the same position. E m ily has often been called a mystic, and with
  considerable justification. H er com plete preoccupation with the
  inner life was very similar to that of mystics. The striking differ-
  ence is that in almost every case the mystics have searched for the
  inner life within the dogma of their faith._Emily Bronteiseem s to
  have been quite unmoved by any consideration of dogma in her
  attem pt to find “new spheres of discovery” on h er inward yoy-
  age. She evideiitly, found.. relating to p eople...very difficult, while
  her relationship to animals was deep and distinctive.39 B u t when
  Branwells death tore open the family defenses against the waves
  of the sea of the unconscious, Em ily was the first to succumb;
  she followed Branwell to the grave in less than three months
  tim e.40 Anne’s defenses w ere a little stronger and held another six
  months, but only C harlottes w ere strong enough to w eather the
  storm and hold for another six years, during which she entered
  another phase and went through considerable development.

ness, the fascination she exercised on Charlotte, and why no one
could make a real relationship to her. It would also explain Ellen
Nusseys statem ent that Emily, unlike Charlotte and Anne, was
quite indifferent to the impression that she made on other peo­
ple. 41 Moreover, it throws a light on the extraordinary story o f her
last three months and h er bew ilderm ent when faced with death.
    It will be rem em bered that M. H éger in Brussels rated Em ily’s
genius considerably above C harlottes, although he evidently
greatly preferred the latter as a hum an being, saying that “Emily
was exacting and egotistical com pared to Charlotte who was always
unselfish.”42 Speaking again of Emily, he notes that “she should
have been a man— a great navigator, her powerful reason would
have deduced new spheres from the knowledge of the old and her
strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposi-
tion or difficulty; never would have given way but with life.”43 If
we com pare this with Charlottes beautiful epitaph on her sister,
“Stronger than a man, simpler than a child, her nature stood alone
. . . ,” we can get some idea of her psychology. She was never really
born into the world as a woman; on this side she rem ained “sim­
pler than a child.” B n ta tta ch e d to her, as _theJ!£Y£L.present.phan-

    it had no pity on her frail physique and eventually— if Charlotte
    is right about her reluctance to die— she becam e its victim as the

/
     T h e A r c h e t y p a l F o u n d a t io n s o f W u t h e r in g H e i g h t s
    W e com e now to the m ost interesting question: W hy did “the
    very source o f creative impulse” in the collective unconscious run
    so high in the case o f the Brontes? Was there any special arche-
    ^ p e , any “great formative influence” pushing its way up toward
    consciousness? W e must turn to                        to find the
    answer to this question, for this book contains an unmistakable
    projected process o f individuation. As is well known, the process
    o f individuation is Jungs term for the developm ent of the origi-
    nally one-sided personality toward a totality consisting both of
 consciousness and the unconscious. This process is m irrored in
fdreams and other unconscious products in the form o f a so-called
    mandala quaternary which is often represented by four figures.
    Strictly speaking, there can be no process o f individuation without
    an individual. But, just as the old alchemists naively projected this
    psychic process into their substances, so Em ily naively projects
    this formative influence into her story and gives us an amazing
    anticipation of the process o f individuation as we know it through
    Jungian psychology today.
       In order to see this process at work, we must p roceed on
    Jungian lines as we should with a dream or other unconscious
    material. That is, we will take all the characters as parts o f a total
    personality. The elder and younger Catherine, for instance, more
    or less represent the projected ego, and the other characters in
    the story represent various autonomous figures that also have
    their place in the totality o f the psyche.

    conscious, panting, reluctant, though resolute, out of a happy life." See Clement Shorter,

     Space forbids m e to give m ore than the m erest outline, a sort

h er_Q ^~Eem oteness- from» her- material. She never en tered her
own psychic drama as an actor, as she tells us herself in her poem
“My C om forter”:


        So stood I, in Heaven's glorious sun,
             And in the glare of Hell;
        My spirit drank a mingled tone,
        Of seraph’s song, and demons moan,
        What my soul bore, my soul alone
             Within itself may tell!45

In W uthering H eights, her soul does tell what it bore within itself,
which, in m y opinion, gives the book its unique character.
    T he psychic dram a into which Mr. L ock n ood reads and
dream s him self that storm y night at W uthering Heights had
begun som e thirty years before when old Mr. Earnshaw returned
from a journey to Liverpool, reentering the ordinary life o f his
family carrying the child Heathcliff, a dirty, ragged, black-haired
orphan. H e says to his wife: "I was never so beaten with anything
in my life. B u t you m ust . . . take it as a gift from God, though it’s
as dark almost as if it cam e from the devil.”
   Old Mr. Earnshaw thus brings in the elem ent that is to change
the whole consciousness, not only o f Wuthering Heights, but also
the estate o f Thrushcross Grange, four miles distant and at that
time quite cut off from W uthering Heights. Mr. Earnshaws words,

moreover, hit the mark exactly. Right through the action, it seems
as if the adult H eathcliff cam e from the devil, as if revenge and
destruction for love rebuked w ere his only aims, and it is only at
the end— when the transformation has been brought about— that
we see that old Mr. Eam shaw was right after all. Heathcliff was a
/gift from God in that he represents the principle o f individuation,
 for without him there would have been no change, and everything
would have continued on the same old, unconscious ancestral lines.
    Heathcliff is one of the best— if not the best— representation
of the figure of the animus that I know in literature. Inexorably
cruel to everything that is weak and destructive, yet he serves the
purpose of purifying the product and brings out the elem ents
that are indestructible. As he says himself: “I have no pity! I have
no pity! The m ore the worms w rithe, the m ore I yearn to crush
out their entrails. It is a moral teething, and I grind with greater
energy in proportion to the increase in pain.” U tterly inhu-
man, demonic like the animus itself, it is yet a “moral teething."
Childishness and weakness are burnt away in H eathcliffs neigh-
borhood. His victims are either destroyed or becom e themselves
indestructible in the heat of the fire o f suffering.
   In this connection, I would like to quote a few lines from
Jung's 1938 Eranos lecture:


      The stirring up of conflict is a Luciferian virtue in the true
      sense of the word. Conflict engenders fire, the fire of affects
      and emotions, and like every other fire it has two aspects,
      that of combustion and that of creating light. On the one
      hand, emotion is the alchemical fire whose warmth brings
      everything into existence and whose heat burns all super-
      fluities to ashes . . . . But on the other hand, emotion is the
      moment when steel meets flint and a spark is struck forth,
      for emotion is the chief source of consciousness. There is no
      change from darkness to light or from inertia to movement
      without emotion.46

This might almost have been written about our story!
   W uthering H eights falls into two parts. T here are two attem pts
to bring about the transformation, that is, a totality o f the human
personality, and th ese are based on four main figures. The
first quaternity consists o f two pairs: H eathcliff and th e elder
Catherine at W uthering Heights, E d g ar and Isabella Linton down
the road at Thrushcross G range. At first the two pairs are entirely
separate. B u t when they are still children, the young H eathcliff
persuades C atherine to escape with him from the washhouse at
W uthering Heights (where they had been locked up for a childish
m isdemeanor) and go for a scam per on the moors, during which
they peep in at the windows of Thrushcross Grange.
   This led in tim e to C atherine’s m arriage to the rich and hand-
som e E d g ar Linton and to H eathcliff marrying E d g ar’s sister
Isabella. In this first quaternity, as m entioned before, C atherine
is m ore or less the representative o f th e ego, and it is h er ambi-
tion, faithlessness, and egotism even m ore than the cruelty of her
b rother that originally forces H eathcliff into such a negative role.
In her conversation with Nelly D ean on th e night o f h er engage-
m ent, she speaks of H eathcliff as th e “one who com prehends in
his person my feelings for E d gar and myself . . . . H e is m ore
m yself than I am .” And eventually: “Nelly, I am H eathcliff.”
   This is a clear avowal that H eathcliff is her animus, but
Catherine throws over her own spirit, prodded on by h er brother,
Hindley, who had reduced H eathcliff to a ploughboy, saying, “It
would degrade her to marry him now.” Thus she refuses Heathcliff,
marries E d gar Linton, and seals the fate o f the first quaternity.
   Through the entirety of W uthering Heights, we repeatedly
m eet this paradox and, although this denial of Heathcliff was the
betrayal o f her own spirit, Catherine enlarges ego-consciousness,
as it w ere, by drawing in the two Lintons. B u t obviously, the pair-
ing was too problem atical, and above all, there was too much
unknow n weakness in Catherine. W e could apply Mrs. Gaskell’s
impression of Em ily to the elder Catherine: “A rem nant of the
Titans, a great-granddaughter o f the giants who used to inhabit the
earth .” B ut she lacked the ordinary human qualities without which
288               The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



we cannot survive. Therefore, the inferior personality— the shad­
ow— was entirely autonomous and appears in Isabella, who then
falls com pletely under the power of Heathcliff. 47 T he unconscious
thus becom es too strong for Catherine, and (to use alchemist lan-
guage) the retort bursts. In the second part o f the story, our author
^icks up her broken pieces and makes a second attempt.
   This second attem pt succeeds, that is, in so far as it is possible
for the process to succeed in a purely projected form. T h e young-
er Catherine— although she has H eathcliff s negative aspect to
deal with, his hatred instead of his love— proves stronger than
h er mother. She has many of her m other’s qualities but also
those of her aunt Isabella. She is both a Linton and an Earnshaw.
Although she and all her possessions fall into H eathcliffs power,
she nevertheless overcom es in the end by accepting her emotion
and suffering. H er childishness and rebellion are burnt away in
the heat of the retort. At the sam e tim e, she discovers that gold
in the nature of h er cousin H areton, who has also produced inde­
structible qualities in his contact with Heathcliff.
    The human pair alone could not have overcom e the dem onic
aspect of Heathcliff. B ut when they have done all that is possible,
the supernatural aid appears, without which the alchemists say
the work cannot be completed.
   W hen the elder Catherine died— twenty years earlier— the
despairing H eathcliff had prayed one prayer:


       Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living;
       you said I killed you—haunt me—then! The murdered do
       haunt their murderers, I believe. I know that ghosts have
       wandered on earth. Be with me always— take any form—
       drive me mad! Only do not leave me in the abyss where I
       cannot find you! Oh, God! It is unutterable! I cannot live
       without my life. I cannot live without my soul!


47. [Barbara Hannah writes in a footnote that what Jung calls the “shadow”’ is, roughly speak­
ing, the negative o f the conscious'personality: all those qualities which belong to the personal
side of our human nature and which we do not see in ourselves fall into the shadow. They
usually first reappear projected into someone in our environment. Ed.]
                     Victi'ms o f the Creative Spirit



This prayer is now granted, and the elder Catherine— always
in the background— appears m ore and m ore distinctly before
H eathcliffs eyes. His task on earth is com pleted, he has burnt out
the destructible and produced the indestructible and is now free
to join C atherine in the beyond. T he two estates are thus restored
to their rightful owners, and the two pairs o f opposites are united:
H eathcliff and the elder Catherine in the beyond, and H areton
and the younger Catherine on earth. A quaternity is thus estab-
lished on the alchem ists model: th e royal pair in the unconscious
and the hum an pair in consciousness. It must be emphasized,
however, that th ere is no quinta essentia, no product o f the whole
process that unites the four again into one, for this would require
a conscious individual in whom th e process was integrated.



                            CONCLUSION
O nce we have seen the archetypal image, .the. .'.‘great fo rm ativ e
influeno^” that reveals itself so c le a d y in W uthering Heights,
w e can verify our hypothesis in th e other Bronte material. In
C h arlottes J a n e E y re, for instance, we have a similar underlying
structure: Jane and her three cousins, the Reeds, appear as the
warring elem ents at the beginning o f the book; they are on the
worst o f term s. Then Rochester, as the animus, also transforms
by suffering. And then we have a harmonious quaternity at the
end o f th e book: Jane and her three cousins on the one side, and
th e Rivers on good term s on the other. B u t the developm ent is
far less com p lete: R ochester is outside the quaternities, and here
there is only th e one im portant m arriage at the end. And this is
indeed only to be exp ected when we think o f the attitude toward
th e unconscious o f the two sisters.
    B ut the m otif of the quaternity— in the form of the double
m arriage— appears at the end of no less than three o f the other
novels. T he best example is in C harlottes Shirley, w here the four
ch ief characters take part in an actual double wedding. In Villette,
D r. John marries “Little Polly,” and L u cy and Paul Em anuel are
engaged. B u t here we find the well-known uncertainty about the
290              The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



fourth. It is left uncertain w hether M. E m anuel will com e home
or be drowned in the storm, that is, symbolically speaking, return
to the unconscious. T he double marriage m otif also appears at
the end o f A nne’s The Tenant o f Wildfell Hall. Gilbert Markam
goes straight from the marriage o f H elen’s brother Fred erick
L aw ren ce and her friend E sth er Hargrave to find H elen herself,
and this m eeting then leads to the second marriage.
      The m otif o f the quaternity also appears very clearly in Em ilys
poem “The Philosopher” as the “three gods that are warring night
and day within this little fram e” and the separate spirit that is
standing alone with th e three rivers running round his feet; or in
the four Genii of their earliest writings; and in many other places.48
   It is often said that the Brontes w ere born before their time.
If the hypothesis is co rrect that the process of individuation was
constellated by the high tide in the collective unconscious which
broke into this gifted family, then they did, from their o ^ u point
o f view, live before there was a possibility o f either understanding
or coming to term s with the arch e^ p al images of this process.
But, from our point of view, they lived at exactly the right time,
when the images of this archetype w ere again rising to the surface
as they have done so often in other forms during the history of
mankind. The Bronte sisters paid a heavy price and w ere perhaps
its victims, but they bore their witness nobly, each in her own way.

P A T TERNS OF BEHAVIOR-WHICH ARE INBORN IN THE ANIMAL
kingdom— are now fully recognized and even enjoy considerable
popularity. But Jungs contribution to this field— pointing out that
the human infant is also not born a tabula rasa but has its own
archetypal patterns— is still by no means generally accepted; in
feet, it is often bitterly opposed. This is undoubtedly partly due to
the fact that the lower the living being (to use that rather suspect
word) is in its individual intelligenceand development, the easier
it is to recognize its pattern of behavior. It is in the insect world
above all that it is so plain that it cannot be misused or opposed.
     If we consider the instincts to be found in the animal world, we
will see that the element of learning is sometimes totally absent.
In certain cases, it is impossible to conceive how any learning and
practice could ever have come about.
     An interesting example that Jung refers to is the incredibly
refined instinct of propagation found in the yucca moth. The
flowers of the yucca plant open for one night only. On this night,
the moth takes the pollen from one of the flowers and kneads it
into a little pellet. Then it calls on a second flower, cuts open the
pistil, lays its eggs between the ovules, and then stuffs the pellet
into the funnel-shaped opening of the pistil. Only once in its life
does the moth can y out this operation.1 Jung later notes that:


l. C. G. Jung, “Instincts and the Unconscious” (1948), in CW, vol. 8 (Princeton, N.J.:
Princeton University Press, 1969), par. 268.
292            The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



       Just as conscious apprehension gives our actions form and
       direction, so unconscious apprehension through the arche-
       type determines the form and direction of instinct. If we
       call instinct “refined,” then the “intuition” which brings
       the instinct into play, in other words the apprehension by
/      means of the arche^pe, must be something incredibly pre­
       cise. Thus the yucca moth must carry within it an image,
       as it were, of the situation that “triggers off’ its instinct.
       This image enables it- to “recognize” the yucca flower and
       its structure.2

After this pattern is com plete, the m oth takes no further interest
in the fate of its eggs; in fact, it usually dies long before they have
hatched. But after the tiny caterpillars crawl out of their eggs and,
through metamorphosis, evolve into moths— they then follow
that same innate pattern of behavior. Jung writes that:


       If we could look into the psyche of the ^ cca moth, for
       instance, we could find in it a pattern of ideas, of a numinous
       or fascinating character, which not only compels the moth to
       carry out its fertilizing activity on the yucca plant, but helps
       it to “recognize” the total situation. Instinct is anything but
       a blind and indefinite impulse, since it proves to be attuned
       and adapted to a definite externai situation. 3

      Another example is the leaf-cutting ant. It too acts instinctu-
ally to fulfill an image, and the image has fixed qualities: ant, tree,
leaf, cutting, transport, and the little ant-garden o f fungi. If any
one o f these conditions is lacking, the instinct does not function
because it cannot exist without its total pattern or without the
outer physical images. Jung notes that it is inborn in the ant prior
to any activity, for there can be no activity at all unless an instinct
of corresponding pattern initiates and makes it possible.

   Now, clearly, the example of the yucca moth can be under-
stood by everyone, and nobody will wish to deny it. But as you go
up the scale of developm ent in the animal world, such patterns
b ecom e m ore and m ore difficult, to be sure, for in even. the most
humble o f the warm -blooded vertebrates, the young are born
dependent on their m others or, at the very least, on substitute
adult parents of the sam e species. Then, naturally, the question
arises: H ow m uch is taught to the young creatures as they grow
up by their parents and how m uch do they know from innate pat­
terns o f behavior?
   A lot o f fascinating research has been undertaken in this field.
I will only m ention one example which is pretty sure to b e known
to all of you, and that is the lioness E lsa who is the heroine, so to
speak, in the books B orn F re e and Living Free. She is also the
m other o f the cubs who then figure in the last— and in m y opinion
least satisfactory— publication, that is, the television series F o rev er
F ree, all written by Jo yA d am so n . E lsa also appears briefly in
G eorge Adam sons book, which just appeared this year: A Lifetim e
with Lions. The only thing that concerns usj here is the fact that
the lioness was only with h er parents for a few days, then with her
sisters for the first months, but was entirely brought up in sole
companionship of human beings. It is therefore out o f the ques­
tion that she was taught any of the arts of survival in the bush by
h er parents or any other lions. Yet when the Adamsons decided to
readapt h er to life in the bush, there w ere many patterns o f behav­
ior innate in h er that they could not possibly have taught nor could
she have learned them elsewhere. True, she needed a great deal of
help to support herself at first, but she nevertheless knew how to
hunt and kill a d eer exactly like h er wild fellow lions, for instance,
and from the beginning she dragged h er kills in the approved, age-
old lion fashion. Through h er mating with a wild lion, she cam e
into contact with h er own kind, but that was m uch later, when she
was far down the road o f being able to support herself in the bush.
    This is still a comparatively simple example o f innate patterns
o f behavior; this is not likely to be disputed. Jungs schem a holds
true o f all instincts and is found in identical form in all individu-
294                    The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



als of the same species. T he same holds true for human beings;
we have in us these a priori instinct-types and instinct-images
which provide the occasion and the pattern for many o f our most
fundam ental activities. As biological beings, we have no choice
but to act in a specifically human way and fulfill our pattern of
beh avior.4 But when it com es to the hum an being— especially to
the so-called civilized human being— they do b ecom e m ore dif­
ficult to recognize because they do not manifest in such simple
physical facts.
    This m eans— to employ once m ore the simile o f the spec-
trum — that the instinctual image is to be located not at the red
end but at the violet end of the color band. T h e dynamism of
instinct is lodged, as it w ere, in the infrared part of the spectrum ,
w hereas the instinctual image lies in the ultraviolet part.


    in stin ct - in frared arche^type                                 ultraviolet
             (dynamic instinct)                                 (image of dynamic instinct)


Consciousness can move anywhere along the scale betw een the
infrared and the ultraviolet. L a te r Jung adds that the realization
and assimilation of instinct never takes place at the red end, that
would be by “absorption” into the instinctual sphere, but only
through integration of the image that signifies and evokes the
instinct, although the form is quite different from the one we
 m eet on the biological level.”5
   There is, however, one simple basic archetypal pattern of
 human behavior that can be found in all times and places, and
 that is the pattern of the process of individuation. Jung used to say
that if you dig deep enough under every kind of human effort you
will always find the search for the meaning of life or the attem pt
to express our innate totality, for the archetype of the process of
 individuation is the most com prehensive o f all of the archetypes
 effecting our lives. Jung has even stated that the archetype of indi-

viduation contains all other archetypes. You all know how conclu-
sively he has shown that the process, projected into “the retort,”
is the foundation of the old alchemists' work. And most o f you are
acquainted with the quaternities and double quaternities from
the writings o f the Gnostics, which Jung brings in the fourteenth
chapter o f A io n .6 And it is just as m uch to be found in the founda­
tions of all the religions from the m ost primitive to the m ore dif-
ferentiated. The principal symbol is th e mandala, with which you
are all acquainted. It manifested as the archetypal im age in the
earliest days and places— such as the old Mayan culture— where
all connections through transmigration are out o f the question.
   Pythagoras, already in the sixth century B.C.E., drew atten-
tion in words to the fact that the num ber four— the basis of the
mandala— was the best possible expression for the totality o f man.
As far as I know, this is the first conscious and docum ented for-
mulation o f the process o f individuation, the earlier images being
produced unconsciously in the same m anner that animals and
insects carry out their patterns o f behavior. One can see the same
thing in the drawings o f children today, and they could certainly
tell you nothing in words about the process of individuation. Yet
mandalas and quaternities appear very often in their drawings. I
rem em b er myself, as a small child, the great satisfaction it gave
m e to do drawings in circular or square forms. I was especially
fond o f drawing these on clean blotting paper, an activity for
which I was often scolded— in vain. B ut o f course I had not the
slightest idea what I was doing or representing until I cam e d o ^
here to Zürich in my late thirties. T hen this habit reasserted
itself— or possibly had never stopped— and Toni W olff drew my
attention to what I was doing.
    It is, therefore, not surprising that we also find this basic pattern
o f behavior in literature. It is a kind o f unconscious searching for
one’s lost wholeness. E very child goes through a period of whole-
ness when it is very young, certain undisturbed primitives even
rem ain in this state all o f their lives. B ut the child who is raised

in our so-called civilization is soon called out of this paradise and
educated m ore and m ore to fit into our one-sided world, which
no longer has m uch o f an idea o f wholeness. O ur civilization, for
example, suffers from the loss o f the paradox, thus it is not sur-
prising that— long before m odem psychology— many individuals
Really lived their whole lives in an unconscious search for their
lost wholeness. This struck m e so m uch that I have m ade it the
 them e of a book called Striving Towards W holeness. I took there
the example of six individuals in order to illustrate this them e, all
of them authors. R obert Louis Stevenson shows the first stage of
this search in an unsurpassable way, the search for the lost dual
nature of m an, which would be, in the language of psychology, ego
and shadow. B y far the best known o f his efforts is Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde, but you will find the same them e in many other places
in his writings and most particularly in his own life.
    M ary W ebb is taken as the second example; in h e r most
famous and last com plete novel, Precious B ane, she very nearly
establishes a quatem ity with h er four principle characters that
would have been indeed a paradoxical whole, uniting those two
opposites that give us the most trouble: good and evil. B ut just
as one is enthralled watching how perfectly the process of indi­
viduation has succeeded in projecting itself into her story, her
Christian upbringing takes fright at the dark qualities o f two of
her characters, and she lets the whole thing fall apart and depicts
the triumph of the light over its opposite the dark. Although h er
attem pt to unite the opposites and to produce a lasting image
of the process of individuation fails, there is a great deal to be
learned form her very failure, especially if one com pares it vvith
the far m ore successful attem pt of Em ily B ron te in W uthering
Heights. In fact, there is no doubt that— as far as my knowledge
goes— we can find the best and clearest examples of the totality of
the process o f individuation— and its efforts to manifest itself— in
the Bronte family. Like M ary W ebb, Branwell’s failure can teach
us quite as much as his three sisters and their varying degrees of
success. Therefore, I took all four Brontes in my book as four of
 six examples of attem pts at individuation.

hom e in the world of the archetypal images of the unconscious.
They produced endless magazines in which they described their
experiences, often identifying with the famous m en o f the day.
Charlotte often w rote in the nam e o f som e famous man, usually as
one o f the two sons of the Duke o f Wellington. It is a remarkable
fa ct that C harlotte always w rote as a man until well after h er stay
in Brussels (when she was about thirty); in fact, until about the
tim e that she w rote Ja n e E y re.
    She w rote Strange Events in the person of L ord Charles
Wellesley, the younger son o f the D uke o f Wellington. “H e ” intro-
duces the work by saying: “I fell into the strangest train o f thought
that ever visited even my mind, eccen tric and unstable as it is said
by some insolent puppies to b e .”1 “H e ” continues:


       It seemed as if I was a non-existent shadow— that I nei­
       ther spoke, ate, imagined, or lived of myself, but I was a
       mere idea, of some other creatures brain. The Glass Town
       seemed so likewise. My father, Arthur, and everyone with
       whom I am acquainted passed into a state of annihilation;
       but suddenly I thought again that I and my relatives did
       exist and yet not us but our minds and our bodies with­

      I should like to consider this                  experience— presum ably
C harlottes own— from two differing vie^points, that is, from the
standpoint of those “Siamese twins.” Apparently C harlotte is, to
some extent, seeing our everyday reality as the animus himself
sees it. The human being appears as a “non-existent shadow” and
is a “m ere idea, o f some other creatu res brain.” One is vividly
rem inded o f the dreams reported by C. G. Jung in M em ories,
D ream s, Reflections. Jung writes:

      The thomy problem of the relationship between eternal man,
      the self, and earthly man in time and space was illuminated
      by two dreams of mine.
           In one dream, which I had in October 1958, I caught
      sight from my house of two lens-shaped metaUicaüy gleam-
      ing disks which hurtled in a narrow arc over the house and
      d o ^ to the lake. They were two UFOs (Unidentified Flying
      Objects). Then another body came flying directly toward
      me. It was a perfectly circular lens, like the objective of a
      telescope. At a distance of four or five hundred yards it stood
      still for a moment, and then flew off. Immediately afterward,
      another came speeding through the air: a lens with a metallic
      extension which led to a box—a magic lantern. At a distance
      of sixty or seventy yards it stood still in the air, pointing
      straight at me. I awoke with a feeling of astonishment. Still
      half in the dream, the thought passed through my head: ‘We
      always think that the UFOs are projections of ours. Now
      it turns out that we are their projections. I am projected
      by the magic lantern as C. G. Jung. But who manipulates
      the apparatus?”
           I had dreamed once before of the problem of the self
      and the ego. In that earlier dream I was on a hiking trip. I
      was walking along a little road through a hilly landscape; the
      sun was shining and I had a wide view in all directions. Then
       I came to a small wayside chapel. The door was ajar, and I
      went in. To my surprise there was no image of the Virgin on
       the altar, and no crucifix either, but only a wonderful flower
       arrangement. But then I saw that on the floor in front of the
       altar, facing me, sat a yogi—in lotus posture, in deep medita-
       tion. When I looked at him more closely, I realized that he
      had my face. I started in profound fright, and awoke with the
       thought: “Aha, so he is the one who is meditating me. He has
       a dream, and I am in it.” I knew that when he awakened, I
      would no longer be.3

300          The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



   It is clear that Jung’s dreams belong to a totally different stage
and personality, full o f positive creativeness, whereas the state-
m ent in C harlottes fantasy has a certain annihilating, negative
quality that is very characteristic o f the autonomous animus. B u t
the meaning is the same. In both cases the human being is the
^ o je ctio n , dream , o r idea o f the eternal man.
     At first C harlottes animus entirely annihilates our reality,
and particularly L o rd Charles’s own relatives, but then a grain
of humanity creeps in: “I thought again that I and m y relatives
did exist and yet not us but our minds and our bodies without
ourselves.”
   T he mind and th e body are seen as two separate entities
pointing to the fact that, when things appear double in dreams,
it is often a sign that something which has been deeply uncon­
scious is just com ing up over the b ord er o f consciousness; they
will eventually be seen as one but at first they appear as two.
‘W ith o u t ourselves” seems to be a faint realization o f the insub-
stantiality of the ego without the Self, but this becom es clearer
in the next sentence.
   H ere she seems to catch a glimpse o f what we would call, in
Jungian term s, the archetype o f the Self, or the t o t l i t y o f the
personality. Presum ably this is the “oth er cre a tu re ” whose “idea”
is the hum an being. The pronouns w e and us are very sugges-
tive: “W hen we (the subject) are m ere shadows without 'us’ (the
ob ject).” Jung often speaks o f th e Self and the unconscious as
the “objective p syche” and th e ego and its consciousness as the
“subject.” And the “beings that really lived in a tangible shape . . .
called by our names . . . from whom we had been copied” con-
tains just the same idea as w e have already seen in Jung’s dream ,
when the yogi, whose dream or m editation was Jung’s whole
life, had the same features as his earthly body. Presum ably these
beings are soul or psyche, and already a union of the two oppo­
sites, mind and body, for the psyche unites— or is— both spirit
and matter. These beings dem onstrate th e idea of the Self being
present from the beginning as the framework o f the crystal in the
solution; but which is then only seen “dimly and indistinctly at
                The Animus in Charlotte Bronte’s Stran ge E ven ts                     301



th e end o f a long vista.”4 It is the work of a whole lifetime to see
it at all distinctly— as Jung saw the yogi in his dream — or, in other
words, for th e crystal to take the shape o f the unique individual.
   F rom the point o f view o f the animus, it is quite clear that,
w hereas th e original minds and bodies o f human beings are “with­
out ourselves” (that is, flimsy and unsubstantial, personal but not
yet individual) it is quite different with the “beings in a tangible
shape.”5 This agrees with our o ^ n experience o f the animus. H e
plays ducks and drakes with the ego and its personal wishes but
when the Self is constellated, he is far m ore willing to cooperate.6
   I once saw this very clearly with a girl who was out to get mar­
ried at all costs. She got on particularly well with m en, unless they
w ere m arriageable. Then the animus always interfered and the
man retreated in alarm. She decided to go into analysis and work
out her problem. She did this very honestly and at last reach ed a
genuine sacrifice o f her m arriage plot and decided that life would
be bearable even if she rem ained unmarried. A few years later a
young m an approached her and told her he had long w anted to
m arry her, but something had ^lways stopped him from propos-
ing. Evidently h er sacrificed m arriage plot had constellated som e­
thing o f the Self— which is a unio oppositorum — and now there
w ere two opposites on her horizon— m arriage and single life— so
th e animus was no longer tem pted to destroy it, for it had gained
in substance and was now visible also from his reality.
    It is m y considered opinion that the ego alone can do very little
with the animus, for he is always too clever for it. One sees that
he is leading one do^wn the garden path and avoids that trap, only
to find he has cleverly led one down another. If one really wants
to change the old negative, opinionating animus, one is forced to
turn to th e eternal “beings” in C h arlottes vision, for only the Self
can really transform the animus.
   The vision continues:

       Another world formed part of this reverie in which was no
       Glass Town or British Realm in Africa except Hindoostan,
       India, Calcutta. England was there but totally different in
       manners, law, customs, inhabitants—governed by a sailor—
       my Father Prime Minister. I and Arthur, young noblemen
/      living at Strathaeye, or something with a name like that—
       visionary fairies, elves, brownies, the East Wind, and wild
       Arab-broken horses—shooting in moors with a fat man who
       was a great book. But I am lost, I cannot get on. 7

I should explain that the Glass To^wn, o f which this is the second
m ention, was the capital o f the Angrian kingdom that all four
children founded on the coast o f Africa in their fantasy games.
L a te r only Branwell and Charlotte continued with the Angrian
chronicles; Em ily and Anne founded their own kingdom on the
islands o f Gondal and Gaaldine.
    On the whole this passage seems to be a rather confused
attem pt to describe something o f the collective unconscious,
which she calls “another world.” There is a hint o f order in the
fact that she sees four places— Hindoostan, India, Calcutta, and
England— and that she is struck by the fourth of these being so
“totally different.” B u t, as she says herself, “I am lost, I cannot get
on .” W e will just rem em ber th e “fat man who was a great book”
and return to him later.
      It continues:

       For hours I continued in this state striving to fathom a bot-
       tomless ocean of Mystery, till at length I was roused by a
       loud noise above my head. I looked up and thick obscurity
       was before my eyes. Voices—one like my own but larger and
       dimmer (if sound may be characterized by such epithets)
       and another, which sounded familiar, yet I had never, that I
       could remember, heard it before—murmuring unceasingly
       in my ears.8

Up until now the vision was visual, but here sound enters in and
sight is im peded by thick obscurity. A nother sense is approached,
just like a hiatus in a dream wherein another image is used to get
over som ething incomprehensible to the dreamer. C harlotte can­
not see enough . . . but can she h ear? At first it is just a loud noise,
but then she distinguishes voices, one like h er own and another
familiar yet never heard before. This is a very apt description of
psychic contents which are ourselves, although we have never
b ecom e aware o f them before.
    T h e beginning o f this fantasy seem ed a definite removal from
the hum an realm, which is then seen through the eyes o f the
animus. B ut h ere— although the whole is w ritten in the nam e of
L o rd Charles— one feels that C harlotte is somewhat returning to
herself. T he thick obscurity above is m ore how the hum an being
experiences such things. It is as if the appeal to the second human
sense and the loud noise are waking h er up. B ut this is much
clearer in the next passage:


       I saw books removing from the top shelves and retuming,
       apparently of their own accord. By degrees the mistiness
       cleared off. I felt myself raised suddenly to the ceiling, and
       ere I was aware, beheld two immense sparkling bright blue
       globes within a few yards of me. I was in a hand wide enough
       almost to grasp the Tower of all Nations, and when it lowered
       me to the floor I saw a huge personification of myself . . . . 9

     O ne asks oneself of their own accord and is rem inded of the
“fat man” out shooting in the m oors who was “a great book.”
Evidently one aspect o f h er animus is presumably identical with a
book because writing was h er creative outlet and she was not only
producing volume after volume in h er childhood but was destined
later to w rite a few o f the most famous novels in the English lan­
guage. I should like to rem ind the reader here that Jung once
divided novels into two classes. The first are psychological novels,
and this m ay be why it was just books that w ere moving about
9. Ibid.
304               The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in W o ^ n



w ritten from the conscious. And the second are visionary novels
that com e mainly from the unconscious.10
   T he fact that the books are moving about o f their own accord
strikes m e as a hint that C harlottes books may belong mainly to
the second class, a fact that is born out not only in the books them -
í^lves but also in what Mrs. Gaskell tells us o f the way in which
she w rote. F o r example, M rs. Gaskell says that when C harlottes
publishers w ere pressing her for Villette, she w rote to them :

       It is not at all likely that my book will be ready at the time you
       mention. If my health is spared, I shall get on with it as fast
       as is consistent with its being done, if not well, yet as well as
       I can do it. Not one whit faster. When the mood leaves me
       (it has left me now without vouchsafing so much as a word or
       a message when it will return), I put by the manuscript and
       wait till it comes back again. God knows I sometimes have to
       wait.long—very long it seems to me.11

One wonders how a m od em publisher would react to this line
of argument. But “all haste is o f the devil,” as the Rosarium
Philosophorum says, a wise saying that was far m ore understood
years ago than it is today, and C h arlottes publishers apparently
understood such things very generously however m uch their pro-
gram was disrupted.
   Returning to h er vision, she notes that by degrees the. misti-
ness clears off and later she realizes that she is raised up above the
ground and is standing on a huge hand.
   I would say that this is the main indication that she is no longer
identical with the animus but is now undergoing the experience
m ore in her human shape and size. I would hazard a guess that the
being in tangible shape, which she first perceived at the end o f a
long vista as through the eyes of her animus, has now been realized

enough, for it is now able to take her on its hand, and the shape
has becom e tangible enough for her to stand on. It is as though the
being, called by her name and from whom she has been copied,
has lifted her up to a higher and m ore objective standpoint.
   The first result is that she sees two “immense sparkling bright
blue globes within a few yards” o f her. I am inclined to think that
these. two globes may represent the two realities, our reality and
that o f the animus or the unconscious— in other words: outer and
inner life. This does not contradict the fact that in dream s things
often appear as two when they are com ing over the threshold o f
consciousness, for the two realities— inner and outer— are still
only on th e threshold o f human consciousness. They are in the
state o f the alchem istic separatio, and in our materialistic age
we must discriminate them from the original oneness in order to
realize the reality o f the inner world at all. B u t it is probable that,
as our consciousness increases, the two may well be seen to be
one after all. F o r the present, they are two, as Charlotte can now
see while she is raised on the hand from the ground.
       must be very high up in the stratosphere to see our own
earth as a sphere. The sun and m oon are always seen as round
objects but we only know the earth is round, ordinarily we never
see it as such. W hen Jung saw the earth in “global shape” in his
1 9 4 4 vision— and even then he did not see the whole earth—
he afterward calculated that he would have had to have been
approxim ately one thousand miles above the earth to have such
an extensive view.12 So the great hand m ust have lifted Charlotte
to a vast height, a near parallel to Ezekiel 3 :1 4 , but such visions
are often characterized by exaltation. In the middle o f his great
vision, for example, Ezekiel says: “So the spirit lifted m e up and
took m e away and I went in bitterness, in the heat o f my spirit;
but the hand o f the L o rd was strong upon m e.”
   Charlotte sees her two globes as equal in every respect. H er
perception is neither from the ego point o f view, w here the
unconscious is indistinct or even invisible, nor from that o f the
animus, w here our reality is apparently indistinct or even nonexis-
12. Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, pp. 289f.
                  The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



tent, but from a standpoint lent her by the tangible psychic being,
the “eternal man” or "god-m an” in herself.
    But like all exalted visions it only lasts for a m om ent, then
she is lowered to the ground again. She is no longer in the hand
o f the eternal being but down on the earth looking at the latter.
^vidently she has now returned to h er o^wn human size, standing
on her own reality, with her feet on the ground, seeing th e being
who is “called by her name” and with h er own features as a figure
"hundreds of feet high— standing against the great Oriel.”
   This is a m ost amazing image o f the small but definite human
ego gazing up at the great archetypal Self whose “idea” makes up
our hum an life. One can scarcely doubt here th at it is Charlotte
herself who had this vision and that she is here seeing through
her own eyes and not— as at the beginning— through those of her
animus alone.
   B ut this point o f view com es back in the next and concluding
paragraph:


       This filled me with a weight of astonishment greater than
       the mind of man ever before had to endure, and I was now
       perfectly convinced of my non-existence except in another
       corporeal frame which dwelt in the real world, for ours I
       thought was nothing but idea.13

As mentioned before, we have indeed evidence, including that
of Jung’s dream of the yogi dream ing Jung’s whole life, th at she
is quite right in assuming that the hum an being is the idea o f the
eternal being. It is the "nothing but” that reveals the animus with
his original devilish opinion of the com plete unim portance and
meaninglessness of this world. Jung com m ents on his yogi dream:

       I had this dream after my illness in 1944. It is a parable: My
       self retires into meditation and meditates my earthly form.
       To put it another way: it assumes human shape in order
       to enter threè-dimensional existence, as if someone were
13. Gaskell, The Life ofC harlotte Bronte, p. 41.
               The Animus in Charlotte Bronte’s Stran ge E ven ts        307




      putting on a diver’s suit in order to dive into the sea. When
      it renounces existence in the hereafter, the self assumes
      a religious posture, as the chapei in the dream shows. In
      earthly form it can pass through the experiences of the three-
      dimensional world, and by greater awareness take a further
      step toward realization.14

   H ere— as in many oth er places— Jung emphasizes th e great
im portance o f our reality, of the h ere and now, the im portance
indeed for the Self to be able to en ter “three dimensional exis­
ten ce” in order to gain greater awareness and thus realize itself
further than ever before. SpeaMng o f the dead, who are clearly
also in the unconscious, Jung says in th e same chapter:


          It seems to me as if they were dependent on the living
      for receiving answers to their questions, that is, on those
      who have survived them and exist in a world of change: as if
      omniscience or, as I might put it, omni-consciousness, were
      not at their disposal, but could flow only into the psyphe of
      the living, into a soul bound to a body. The mind of the‘living
      appears, therefore, to hold an advantage over that of the dead
      in at least one point: in the capacity for attaining clear and
      decisive cognitions. As I see it, the three-dimensional world
      in time and space is like a system of co-ordinates; what is here
      separated into ordinates and abscissae may appear "there,” in
      space-timelessness, as a primordial image with many aspects,
      perhaps as a diffuse cloud of cognition surrounding an arche-
      type. Yet a system of coordinates is necessary if any distinc-
      tion of discrete contents is to be possible. Any such operation
      seems to us unthinkable in a state of diffuse omniscience
      or, as the case may be, of subjectless consciousness, with no
      spatio-temporal demarcations. Cognition, like generation,
      presupposes an opposition, a here and there, an above and
      below, a before and after.15

15. Ibid., p. 308.
308            The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Woimen



      H ere Jung speaks o f the two worlds as equal opposites: “A here
and there, an above and below, before and after.” B u t the animus,
in his original form, always tries to belittle the importance o f the
three-dimensional world, and h ere he reduces it to his favorite
formula: “nothing but.” Naturally, he wants the woman to see his
^ality, for very few see it at all and— according to his statem ent to
m e in active imagination— he is naturally tem pted to ignore ours
because he has the same difficulty in realizing it as we have with
his. So it is really not at all surprising that Charlotte is not able to
hold her vision of two equal globes, for this is a realization that
takes a great deal o f effort and a long tim e to attain. Yet despite
h er limited opportunities, she probably eventually w ent as far as
she could toward this realization.
    The inner world was always by far the most real to all the
Brontes, but Charlotte was the only one who later m ade the
m ost valiant efforts to get her roots into the here and now. F o r
years she regarded the inner world— the realm o f imaginative
fantasy— as a secret and fought it with all the strength o f a tyran-
nical conscience. W e already had a hint that a much m ore m ate­
rial phase would follow the animus’s denial o f the reality o f this
world seen in the fatness o f the man on the moors who was also
a book. This indicated substance and weight, which w ere bound
in time to make themselves felt. The “nothing but,” which was
pointed in our vision toward outer life, was afterward directed
against inner life which she has seen h ere as the only real world.
If she was to be true to h er vision o f two equal spheres, then such
an enantiodromia was inevitable, for at first it is only possible to
see one at a time.
      It is the nature o f the animus, in his negative aspect, to move
from one opposite to the other in— from human standards— a
completely irresponsible way. H e will assure the woman o f one
thing on one occasion, only to condem n it utterly on the next.
The anima— allowing for the differences in h er nature— behaves
in m uch the same way. Jung tells us from his o^ n experience in
his description of the anima trying to persuade him that his first
fantasies w ere art. lf he had believed her, he writes:
                 The Animus in Charlotte Bronte’s Stran ge E ven ts     309




       She would in all probability have said to me one day, “Do you
       imagine the nonsense you're engaged in is really art? Not a
       bit.” Thus the insinuations of the anima, the mouthpiece
       of the unconscious, can utterly destroy a man. In the final
       analysis the decisive factor is always consciousness which can
       understand the manifestations of the unconscious and take
       up a position toward them.16

    It was these “insinuations” of th e destructive side of her ani­
mus that w ere to torm ent Charlotte for most of h er subsequent
life. B ut the positive, creative side o f h er animus was always at
least equally strong as h er books still testify. And it strikes me
as rem arkable that a fourteen-year-old girl, well over a hundred
years ago, was able to see as m uch of th e "manifestations o f the
unconscious” and record them so objectively and faithfully.

This story has a certain am ount of warm th and vigor, but the iron-

that is destructive of illusion. This then is the essay that Barbara

It is a curiohsly fascinating yarn, which compels itself on its o^n

Appendix Two: The f e g ent Georg e IV




BY 1811 , THE RECURRENT MENTAL ILLNESS OF ENGLAND’S
King George III reached the point where his son George, Prince
of Wales, was appointed Regent. It was the Prince Regent who
personally set the tone for this period, known for its lavish expen-
ditures, material and social extravagance, a lifestyle bordering on
the indolent, and above all, for wonderful romance found today in
so many pulp fiction love stories of that time. The Regency period
was the heyday of the Romantic poets, best known for the works
of Byron, Shelley, and Keats and by authors such as Wordsworth
and Sir Walter Scott. Despite the glamour and frivolousness, the
miserable conditions of life in the slums— so vividly described
by authors of the subsequent Victorian era such as Charles
Dickens— apply equally to the misery reigning during this time.
Social reformers struggled to upgrade the prisons and rewrite the
laws for paupers, and the destitute evangelical religious groups
gained popularity, breaking from the Anglican Church. Growing
agitation for political reform came from both the rising middle
class and the laborers themselves. It was during this period that
Jane Austen delighted the country with her timeless accounts
of the manners and morals of the Regency period. The Regent
ascended to the throne and became George IV upon the death of
his father in 1820. He actually reigned as king for only ten years
until his death in 1830. His daughter, Princess Victoria, took over
the throne in 1837, ushering in the Victorian era, which prevailed
until her death in 1901.
314            The Animus: The Spirit o f Inner Truth in Women



      G eorge IV was the antithesis o f his father. H e was conserva-
tive and disinterested— or, at best, infrequent— in his political
involvement yet active in licentious affairs of the heart. As Prince
Regent, he had many mistresses until he secretly m arried Maria
Fitzherbert, a Catholic widow fully unacceptable as royalty on the
throne. G eorge III had her dismissed from court and forced his
son to m arry Caroline of Brunswick. The couple detested each
other. Caroline took their only child to Italy and returned only
when George succeeded to th e throne, and this only to claim her
right to her position as queen. G eorge barred h er from his coro-
nation and from all duties.
   Bright, effervescent, extravagantly generous, and able on the
one hand, indolent, spoiled, indulged, and lazy on the other,
G eorge IV was scandalous with his mistresses and uncontrolled
in his spending. Yet he was a patron of the arts who left many
wonderfu! artifacts— in particular libraries o f books— for poster-
ity. G eorge’s amorous relationships w ere highly controversial, and
here Jane Austen took him to task. Nevertheless, the Duke of
Wellington considered him to be a m ost extraordinary compouríd
of talent, wit, buffoonery, obstinacy, and good feelings, a m ed-
ley of the most opposite qualities, with a great preponderance
of good.
