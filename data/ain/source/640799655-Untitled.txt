Family trees of the
Norse gods

These are family trees of the Norse gods showing kin relations among gods and other beings in
Nordic mythology. Each family tree gives an example of relations according to principally Eddic
material however precise links vary between sources. In addition, some beings are identiﬁed by
some sources and scholars.

Diversity in belief

While the above family trees are based principally on Eddic material, it is widely accepted that
the Eddas do not represent the worldview of all Nordic, or more widely Germanic heathens. Terry
Gunnell has similarly challenged the concept of all Germanic pagans throughout the Viking Age
believing in a single, universal pantheon of gods that all lived in Asgard and were ruled by
Odin.[53] Cultural exchange of both ideas and practices occurred across the soft cultural
boundaries with neighbouring peoples from broad cultural groups such as Celts, Sámi, Baltic
peoples, and, particularly later on, Christians. Geographical variation in religious practices and
beliefs was also seen, which together with external inﬂuence made the belief systems dynamic,
changing over time from the Nordic Bronze Age into the Viking age.[54]

In the Early Medieval period, Odin was principally a god of the warrior elite, however, due to his
close association with skalds, whose poetry was preserved in works such as the Prose Edda and
Heimskringla, he is highly represented in extant sources on Nordic pre-Christian religion. Snorri
Sturluson also seems to have a preference towards the aristocratic-centred cosmology as
opposed to the views more likely held by the wider population.[53][55] The rise to prominence of
male, war-oriented gods such as Odin, relative to protective female gods with a closer
association to fertility and watery sites, has been proposed to have taken place around 500 CE,
coinciding with the development of an expansionist aristocratic military class in southern
Scandinavia. .[56]

Very rarely in the Eddic stories are the gods described as forming a large family, instead typically
acting individually or in groups of three. Gunnell puts forward the idea that the stories did not
originate in the same cultural environment, but instead were collected over a wide geographic
area and later compiled. This variation may be the cause of the apparent conﬂicts between
sources, such as the most closely associated female god to Odin, which Gunnell suggests never
formed a single uniﬁed system. He further puts forward the idea that Odinic myths centred on
hierarchical assemblies and feasts originated in, and reﬂected, the halls of the elite, while the
rural population would be more familiar with tales regarding Freyr and Thor; these two gods have
a signiﬁcantly more prominent position than Odin in Icelandic and Norwegian place names,
sagas and Landnámabók. Gunnell suggests that Freyr, whose cult was centred in Uppland in
Sweden, as another ﬁgure who acts more as an allfather (Old Norse: alfǫðr) than Odin, based on
his diverse roles in farming, ruling and warfare.[57]

Gunnell further argues that in stories regarding Thor, he is typically highly independent, requiring
little aid from other ﬁgures. He notes that Thor would ﬁt well into the role of a chief god, being
associated with trees, high-seat pillars and rain, and is called upon for help at sea and against
Christian missionaries. Some sources, such as the prologue to the Prose Edda suggest that Thor
was viewed by some as the father of Odin, and it has been argued that Thor was known in
Northern Europe prior to the arrival of the cult of Odin, and thus would not have been originally
viewed there as his son.[58]
It has been argued that Odin began to increasingly incorporate elements from subordinated
gods and took on a role as the centre of a family that became depicted as living together. This
conception, more akin to the Olympian pantheon, may have been facilitated by large things in
which a diversity of peoples assembled, each potentially favouring an individual god.[59]

Notes

  1. Bölþorn is only mentioned in Hávamál stanza 140 and Gylfaginning chapter 5. In these sources, the
    relationship with Bestla is established but the exact line of parents back to Ymir, progenitor of all jötnar, is
    not.[5]

  2. In Völuspá 18, Hœnir is listed as one of the three gods who created the ﬁrst humans, Ask and Embla,
    along with Lóðurr and Odin, while in Snorri Sturluson's account, it is Odin, Vili and Vé. Hœnir may be
    identiﬁed with either Vili or Vé, however this is equivocal.[14]

  3. The father of Týr is ambiguous. In Hymiskviða, Týr is called the son of the jötunn Hymir, while Snorri
    Sturluson in the Prose Edda names his father as Odin.[24]

  4. Járnsaxa is named as a tröllkona in the Nafnaþulur, while in Skáldskaparmál chapter 21, she is identiﬁed
    with Sif.[34]

  5. While Móði's father is named as Thor in Hymiskviða 34, Gylfaginning 52 and Skáldskaparmál 4, his
    mother is never explicitly identiﬁed.[37]

  6. The identiﬁcation of Beli with the brother of Gerðr is only through Freyr killing both her unnamed brother
    and Beli. Due to the sparse evidence, the conclusion is equivocal.[46]
