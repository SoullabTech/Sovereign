### **Building the Spiralogic Coaching Platform MVP: Start with the Whole MVP**

Given the platform's comprehensive nature, starting with the **whole MVP** makes sense if you want to deliver a fully functional foundation from the beginning. Here’s a step-by-step plan to develop the platform with the **interactive survey** as the centerpiece, while keeping scalability and user experience in mind.

### **MVP Development Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Spiralogic Framework and Core Features**

1. **Interactive Survey Tool**:
    
    - **Focus**: Build a robust and dynamic survey that calculates elemental scores and provides personalized feedback.
    - **Action Items**:
        - Implement questions grouped by **Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Aether**.
        - Use a **Likert scale** (0–3) for responses.
        - Include scoring logic to calculate **elemental balances** and **shadow traits**.
    - **Outcome**:
        - Survey results populate a dynamic **Holoflower visualization** and offer feedback.
2. **Elemental Wheel Visualization**:
    
    - **Focus**: Create a dynamic radar chart (or flower model) that updates based on survey results.
    - **Action Items**:
        - Map elemental scores to the visualization.
        - Include interactivity (e.g., hover to see individual scores for Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable phases).
    - **Outcome**:
        - Users can visually understand their elemental balance and areas for growth.

#### **Step 2: User Profiles and Data Tracking**

1. **User Onboarding**:
    
    - **Focus**: Simplify onboarding with step-by-step instructions.
    - **Action Items**:
        - Add a **welcome flow** explaining the Spiralogic framework.
        - Collect initial user data (e.g., name, goals, primary concerns).
    - **Outcome**:
        - A personalized user profile linked to survey results.
2. **History and Trends**:
    
    - **Focus**: Allow users to track their progress over time.
    - **Action Items**:
        - Save survey results and scores in a database.
        - Develop a **line chart** or **progress tracker** showing historical trends.
    - **Outcome**:
        - Users can view their growth and recurring patterns in elemental balance.

#### **Step 3: Coaching Dashboard**

1. **Client Profiles**:
    
    - **Focus**: Provide coaches with detailed client information.
    - **Action Items**:
        - Include client survey results, elemental scores, and trends.
        - Add session notes and feedback tracking.
    - **Outcome**:
        - Coaches can easily prepare for sessions with actionable insights.
2. **Session Planning Tools**:
    
    - **Focus**: Enable coaches to plan sessions effectively.
    - **Action Items**:
        - Pre-load exercises and journaling prompts tied to the elements.
        - Allow coaches to assign tasks and track completion.
    - **Outcome**:
        - Coaches can create tailored plans for clients with minimal effort.

#### **Step 4: AI-Driven Personalization**

1. **Conversational AI**:
    
    - **Focus**: Add a simple AI layer to assist users.
    - **Action Items**:
        - Develop prompts for daily check-ins.
        - Offer tailored recommendations based on recent engagement.
    - **Outcome**:
        - Users feel supported and guided through daily interactions.
2. **Recommendations Engine**:
    
    - **Focus**: Provide actionable suggestions based on survey results.
    - **Action Items**:
        - Use survey scores to suggest exercises, meditations, or prompts.
        - Include phase-specific guidance (e.g., rituals for Fire, grounding for Earth).
    - **Outcome**:
        - Users receive clear, actionable steps to improve balance.

#### **Step 5: Feedback and Refinement**

1. **Pilot Testing**:
    
    - **Focus**: Validate functionality with a small group of coaches and clients.
    - **Action Items**:
        - Test usability of the survey, dashboard, and feedback systems.
        - Collect qualitative and quantitative feedback.
    - **Outcome**:
        - Identify and address pain points before a broader launch.
2. **Iteration**:
    
    - **Focus**: Refine based on user feedback.
    - **Action Items**:
        - Enhance user experience (e.g., simplify navigation, improve visuals).
        - Fix bugs and optimize performance.
    - **Outcome**:
        - A polished, user-friendly MVP.
