# Embodied Wisdom and Somatic Intelligence

Exploring the intelligence of the body and how somatic awareness deepens spiritual and psychological development.

## Beyond the Mind

For too long, Western approaches to consciousness have privileged the mind over the body. But the body holds its own intelligence - a knowing that predates language and operates below the level of conscious thought.

## Somatic Markers and Intuition

What we call intuition is often our body speaking to us through sensations, tensions, and releases. Learning to read these somatic markers is a crucial skill for anyone engaged in consciousness work.

## Trauma and the Body

Trauma lives in the body, not just in our thoughts and memories. This is why purely cognitive approaches to healing often fall short. We must engage the soma - the lived body - to truly integrate and heal.

## Practices of Embodiment

Embodiment isn't something you achieve once and for all - it's an ongoing practice of coming back into presence with the felt sense of being alive in a body.

The breath, movement, touch, sound - these are all doorways back into embodied presence.
