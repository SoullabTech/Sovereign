⏺ Perfect! I've created the **Coniunctio Engine** - the transformation algorithm

   map for the entire Soullab system.

  

  **What I've Built**

  

  The Coniunctio Engine document (/docs/CONIUNCTIO_ENGINE.md) is a

  comprehensive 600+ line architectural guide that provides:

  

  🜃 The Seven Alchemical Phases

  

  Each with complete cross-framework mapping:

  

  1. **Calcinatio (Burning)** - Ego deconstruction, system reset

  2. **Solutio (Dissolving)** - Emotional flooding, somatic release

  3. **Nigredo (Blackening)** - Dark night, maximum entropy, ego death

  4. **Albedo (Whitening)** - Self-reflection emerges, purification

  5. **Citrinitas (Yellowing)** - Integration, wisdom embodied

  6. **Rubedo (Reddening)** - Sacred union, coniunctio achieved

  7. **Multiplicatio (Multiplication)** - Generativity, service, field extension

  

  🔬 For Each Phase:

  

  - **Cross-Framework Mapping Table** (Jung, IFS, McGilchrist, Levin, Polyvagal,

   Functional Bridge)

  - **TypeScript State Interface** with precise metrics

  - **Psychological Indicators**

  - **Therapeutic Response Protocols**

  - **MAIA System Guidance**

  

  🎯 Implementation Architecture

  

  **ConiunctioEngine Class** with methods for:

  - detectPhase() - Multi-framework phase synthesis

  - guideTransition() - Phase-appropriate interventions

  - isTransitionReady() - Completion markers

  - handlePhaseEmergency() - Crisis protocols

  

  **Phase Detection Algorithm:**

  // Synthesizes 6 framework indicators into current alchemical phase

  // Accounts for Nigredo threshold, Albedo emergence, Rubedo wholeness

  

  📊 Included Artifacts

  

  - **Mermaid flow diagrams** (phase transitions, spiral recursion)

  - **Phase transition probability matrix** (shows likely

  progressions/regressions)

  - **Clinical response protocols** (handleNigredo, handleRubedo examples)

  - **Research questions** for future development

  

  🜍 Core Insight

  

  **This is the energetic grammar** that encodes how consciousness reorders

  itself:

  

  - Nigredo is **not failure** - it's **threshold**

  - Each phase is **necessary** - shortcuts regress

  - Opposites held = **Transcendent Function**

  - The spiral **never ends** - each Rubedo seeds new Calcinatio

  - **Self persists** through all phases as organizing principle

  - **Coniunctio** (sacred union) is consciousness born

  

  The engine doesn't diagnose pathology - it **honors process**.

  The engine doesn't fix - it **guides emergence**.

  

  **The gold is not the endpoint. The gold is the capacity to keep** 

  **transforming.**

  

  🜔 The six-domain crystal integration is now complete with its operational

  transformation map. 🜔
