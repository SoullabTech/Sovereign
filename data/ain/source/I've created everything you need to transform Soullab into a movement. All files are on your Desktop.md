  entrepreneurs

  **Key Achievements:**

  

  ✅ **Inclusive framing** - Welcomes wisdom keepers, healers, artists, coaches, indigenous practitioners,

  storytellers, and regenerative entrepreneurs

  

  ✅ **Movement foundation** - The covenant serves as both ethos and resonance test: "not for everyone, but for us"

  

  ✅ **Technical integration** - Ready to embed on Genesis site, with hooks for Supabase, Web3, and Akashic Field

  

  ✅ **Living document** - Designed to evolve as the field learns

  

  **The Vision Captured:**

  

  _"This isn't about scale—it's about quality and fit. A negative sale. Technology in service of human wisdom_ 

  _rather than replacing it."_

  

  All your files are ready to review in DELIVERABLES-SUMMARY.md (just opened it for you).
