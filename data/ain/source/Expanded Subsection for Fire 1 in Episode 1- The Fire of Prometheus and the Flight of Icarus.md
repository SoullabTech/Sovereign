#### **Narration**:

_"Throughout myth and history, humanity has been defined by its willingness to reach for the extraordinary. In Greek mythology, Prometheus stole fire from the gods, gifting humanity the spark of creativity and progress. Icarus, often seen as a cautionary tale, also reminds us of the courage to dream, to soar, to push the boundaries of what we know."_
