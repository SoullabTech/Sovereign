 Differences

  soullab.life/maya/diagnostics - Real-time MAIA system monitoring
  focused on:
  - Live event stream from analytics tracking
  - System health (API status, conversations held)
  - Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
  - API endpoint performance
  - Quick actions to open Maya interfaces
  - Technical/developer focused

  soullab.life/beta/monitor (ARIA Monitor) - Comprehensive beta testing
  dashboard with 10 tabs:
  1. feedback - Transformative impact metrics (personal growth,
  consciousness expansion)
  2. users - Beta tester status, registration tracking, activity
  3. spiral - 12-Facet hero's journey tracking across life domains
  4. protection - Safety metrics, verification rates, hallucination
  tracking
  5. conversation - Voice flow metrics, engagement, turn-taking
  6. maya - Maya evolution & learning progress
  7. evolution - Voice & personality development

  How to Use Them

  Diagnostics (/maya/diagnostics):
  - Monitor real-time events during development
  - Check API response times
  - Verify system connectivity
  - Debug live sessions

  ARIA Monitor (/beta/monitor):
  - Track beta tester onboarding & engagement
  - Monitor user journey progression
  - View system readiness for beta launch
  - Analyze multi-dimensional metrics across all 10 tabs
  - Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

  The ARIA Monitor is much more comprehensive for beta testing and user
  tracking, while Diagnostics is lighter-weight for technical debugging.
