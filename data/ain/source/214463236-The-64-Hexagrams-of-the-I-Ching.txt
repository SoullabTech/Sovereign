01 / 63 The Creative, Heaven Assertion (Single-Mindedness, Self-contained, totalising) (12->01->11->02)

"CH'IEN: spirit power, creative and destructive; unceasing forward motion; dynamic, enduring, untiring; firm, stable; heaven, soverign, father; also: dry-up, parched, exhausted, cleared away. The ideogram: sprouts or vapors rising from the ground and sunlight, both fecundating moisture and scortching drought." ERANOS p94 Image: "[Perseverence doubled - single-mindedness]. Heaven moves continuously. using this fundamental power, one never needs to stop and rest." In a context of perseverence we utilise singlemindedness. Commentary
Hexagram 01 is both excessive but also inspirational in that filled with energy, the need for balance is achieved through continuous interaction with the outside, where each sensation is an energy release. This is an extreme state, but with controlled release of the pent-up forces it can be highly creative. Hexagram 01 is the specific form of hexagram 07 Click here for changing line details

Extended Commentary
The raw context of the situation is described by hexagram 28 - Exceeding. (too much yang). Through refinement we pass through hexagram 34 - inspiring, before reaching this one.

02 / 00 The Receptive, Earth Devoting, Trusting (Dual-mindedness) (11->02->12->01)

"K'UN: Surface of the world; concrete extension; basis of all existance, where CH'IEN..exerts it's power; all-involving service; earth; moon, wife, mother; courtiers, servants. The ideogram: terrestrial globe and stretch out, stability and extension."ERANOS p163
Image:

"[With devotion comes trust]. The power of the earth: Global nurturing. One supports others through generous devotion"
In a context of devotion we utilise trust. Commentary:

Hexagram 02 is devoid of substance, leading to an admiration for someone/ something outside. A sense of emptyness inside develops a need for balance which is achieved through the continuous absorption and nurturing of the outside; one is attracted to a goal of inner stillness rather than outer peace, achievable through devotion - the act of internalizing someone else's belief system. To be open to this requires the development of Absolute Trust and includes a degree of 'dual'-mindedness. Hexagram 02 is the specific form of hexagram 13
Traditional Single Changing Line Comments:

Line 1

"The influences of pending darkness are almost unnoticable; be wary."
Line 2

"One needs to always remain adaptable to the demands of the outside. this adaptability is more stimulus-response than considered action."
Line 3

"In testing times one retain's one's composition. It is possible to go about one's business but do not expect to complete anything."
Line 4

"By keeping things within, one avoids being aroused by blame as well as praise."
Line 5

"One acquires the robes of a devotee [a uniform]. The beginning of understanding meaning and one's identity. This is a form of security."

"CHUN : begin or cause to grow; assemble, accumulate, bring under control; hoard possessions; establish a military camp; difficult, arduous. The ideogram: sprout piercing hard soil"ERANOS p114
Image :

"[With enlightenment comes overcoming(control)]. From out of the mist, an arousing power: Beginning Growth. One uses the laws to establish things."
In a context of enlightenment, a new beginning, we utilise control. Commentary

Hexagram 03 is where one meets difficulties as one starts a new task or introduces a new paradigm (rooted in an initial context of admiration and an hungering for anything); usually because we have found the present foundations (if any) unacceptable but still in force. However, there are still basic social foundations that we can use to help accomplish our task. In the Fu Hsi arrangement, this hexagram is next to hexagram 42 Increase (order no. 36). 42 deals with the change from one level to the next. 03 (order no. 35) symbolizes the beginning of a level, the raw state eventually to become refined.
Traditional Single Line Comments:

Line 1

"The lowly person, when faced with new conditions needs to persevere through uniting others to their cause."
Line 2

"At the beginning of things when one is faced with problems, one needs to be wary of unsolicited help; it may create obligations later. Better to persevere; success will come."
Line 3

"If things become confusing one needs to get a guide. If this is not possible then perhaps one needs to desist."
Line 4

"Although weak in power, if an opportunity arises take it."
Line 5

"With developed levels of confidence there is a tendency for more than one individual to come forth as leader. These hindrances can only be resolved through perseverance and faith."
Line 6

Image :

"[From containment comes retention/selectivity : Masking]. One uses maturing to nurture self development."
In a context of containment we utilise discernment. Commentary

In hexagram 04 the goal here is learning (the lines deal with both student and teacher) and thus developing a sense of security. This is the act of learning how to put on one's social 'mask' with an emphasis on rote teaching/learning. Hexagram 04 is the general form of hexagram 43
The Traditional Single Line Change Comments:

Line 1

"Education requires self-discipline. This needs to be shown at the beginning. Once understood, there is no longer any need to keep enforcing it [avoid excess] since this can lead to dangers."
Line 2

"Learning responsibility includes understanding and respecting the differences in people, both in mind and in body."
Line 3

"Although personally responsible, when faced with the task of taking on social responsibilities one needs to be wary of imitating the apparently more experienced to the extent of losing one's dignity. Keep refining one's self; do not adopt the self of another."
Line 4

"Whilst developing, it is possible for one to become too engrossed and therefore entangled in things, thus leading to humiliation and loss of direction. This lesson needs to be learnt through the humiliation not guidance."
Line 5

"The trust and confidence of a child enables one to willingly be taught."
Line 6

"It is important that social balance (order) be maintained at all times. Development sometimes leads to transgressions. These need to be punished."

"HSU : take care of, look out for, serve; turn your mind to what is necessary; wait, await, wait on; hesitate, doubt; obstinate, fixed. The ideogram: rain and stop, compelled to wait, or rain and origin, providing what is needed"ERANOS p133
Image :

"[With perseverence comes overcoming(control)]. Clouds above relate to heaven: FORCED WAITING. One finds peace of mind in eating and drinking."
I*n a context of perseverence we utilise control. Commentary

In hexagram 05 the goal is to eventually be the active leader(14). However, when danger exists (one's 'moment' has not yet come) one needs to keep one's balance by bidding one's time and let external events follow their course; serving and cultivating as we wait.
The Traditional Single Changing Line Comments:

Line 1

"Waiting on the periphery. Advantageous to continue in this way. No harm. OR Waiting on the periphery. Not offering any opposition at all but sticking to one's principles. Advantageous to continue in this way. No harm."
Line 2

"Waiting on the shoreline. Although slandered by others, one will eventually gain a foothold."
Line 3

"One has jumped the gun and attempted to advance too far. One has become stuck (bogged down). This helplessness attracts enemies - Did no wait long enough."
Line 4

"One has stuck around too long and has lost control of the situation - Waited too long."
Line 5

"One waits by enjoying the moment with drink. A testing time, but appropriate."

"SUNG : dispute, plead in court, contend before a ruler, demand justice; wrangles, quarrels, litigation. The ideogram: words and public, public disputation."ERANOS p142
Image :

"[With containment comes confidence]. Heaven associates with flowing water, opposing movements. COMPROMISE. One prepares well before one starts."
In a context of containment we utilise singlemindedness Commentary

In hexagram 06, since the people we are dealing with are definitely NOT like minded, we need to maintain balance by avoiding going beyond the half way point - meet them in the middle. Thus an emphasis on reflection and not being too rigid (relaxed structuring).
The Traditional Single Changing Line Comments:

Line 1

"It is possible to avoid conflict, especially at the beginning, by passing it by; forget it."
Line 2

"When faced with overwhelming odds, withdrawal is advisable otherwise one's whole community my suffer the consequences."
Line 3

"One can avoid conflict by using history and tradition as a form of nourishment (possession) rather than trying to acquire things for oneself and thus facing the dangers that go with materialism (theft etc)."
Line 4

"When one's situation is uncomfortable there is the temptation to change things (through conflict) if one perceives the external forces as being weak. This would be unwise. By changing oneself and persevering a solution will come."
Line 5

"In any dispute, a suitable arbiter/judge can help resolve an apparently unresolvable situation."
Line 6

"A price is paid for continuing to fight until victory, for one now one has a reputation and there are many others who wish to do battle."

Image :

"[With containment comes trust]: The Army. One allows the common people to form a large group."
In a context of containment we utilise trust. Commentary

Hexagram 07 is the formalized manifestation of like-mindedness. The like mindedness is imposed by the structure and is therefore sociological rather than psychological (as in 13); the only way is the Army's way through the concentration of forces and the dispelling illusions/clearing things away) Hexagram 07 is the general form of hexagram 01
The Traditional Single Changing Line Comments:

Line 1

"An army emerging from the law[created by], if allowed to obstruct virtue (natural law) is dangerous."
Line 2

"A dependence on armies leads to central stability. Advantageous."
Line 3

"A dangerous situation can occur within an army if it is inefficient or if the 'raw' take control over the 'refined'. (Breaking with tradition)"
Line 4

"An inferior army withdraws to rest. No blame. OR An inferior army rests. No blame. It still maintains it's form."
Line 5

"One is faced with the 'untamed'. In times of invasion experienced leaders are required as inexperienced youth could lead to defeat."
Line 6

"The successful general has his fate in his hands. Entering the city he receives a warm welcome. He does not take advantage of the small people. OR The successful general issues commands.

Image :

"[With devotion comes overcoming(control)]: Unity. In primitive times one created many cities to connect the provinces.[And thus unite the state.]"
Commentary

In hexagram 08 one is influencial by one's presence in that one attracts people from all around and establishes a sense of unity. Thus the contextual emphasis on augmentation and distinguishing chaff from wheat. Hexagram 08 is the specific form of hexagram 30
The Traditional Single Changing Line Comments:

Line 1

"To be capable of unity requires sincerity. This may be all one has at the start."
Line 2

"The desire for unity must come from the heart not from the mind, as may be found in an opportunist."
Line 3

"There are times when we attract the wrong people. Be sociable but not intimate."

CH'U : hoard, gather, retain, herd together; control, restrain; domesticate, tame, train; raise, feed, sustain, bring up. The ideogram: field and black, fertile black soil good for pastures, accumulated through retaining silt." ERANOS p168
Image :

"[With perseverence comes influence]: Small Gains. One highlights the noble to enhance one's way."
In a context of perseverence we utilise influence. Commentary

In hexagram 09 we recognize that to become influencial requires work. The process of gentle change through emphasizing one's accomplishments acts as a way of refining one's power, so we make small gains that accumulate and eventually one's time will come.
The Traditional Single Changing Line Comments:

Line 1

"Although capable, one has limited strength and should not be impatient. Refrain from going on this path. Go back."
Line 2

"One is pulled back from this path."

"[With self-reflection comes confidence] [Forced reflection]: Treading. One differentiates the highs and lows, with the purpose of setting right the common people."
In a context of self-reflection we utilise singlemindedness. Commentary

In hexagram 10 one is in a position which requires decorum and the following of the socially 'correct' path. This is not a time for deferring but more of submitting to the situation through a degree of balance (decorum/proper conduct) without moving from one's personal position nor making one's desires apparent; forced reflection whilst we walk in the confines of our environment (thus the context of 47 - the enclosure of a tree 'drives' the roots deep and so one becomes bound and difficult to move beyond one's 'place' - There is a lot of wasted energy).

In a context of devotion we utilise singlemindedness. Commentary

In hexagram 12 we find that there are those who do not seek to change but more to keep the status quo; To those who seek change, this is stagnation; a hindrance. The context is a firming sense of belief and parrying (by forseeing) the thrusts of those against you.

"[With self-restraint comes trust] : Modesty. In the centre of the earth, a mountain : Modesty. One reduces the many to augment the few, and assesses things for an even distribution."
In as context of self-restraint we utilise trust. Commentary

In hexagram 15 we are at a moment where the use of 'acceptable' appearance is required despite our inner desires. This is a time for avoiding excess by keeping things 'grounded'; words to facts. This functions within the context of worth and beauty. (words + facts = value. words or facts alone are 'valueless'; they only serve as 'meaningless' ideals). By maintaining this relationship (a 'level' head) it acts as a gateway into the future. (All four hexagrams (10,15,19,33) cover the concept of deference and advancement which correlates with the overall concept of development found in their base trigrams) Hexagram 15 is the specific form of hexagram 25

In hexagram 16 resistance can be overcome through enthusiasm and foresight, for one to be eventually accepted. (34 and 20 symbolize the total acceptance of an individual within society such that their mere presence can influence. 16 and 9 symbolize resistance to an individual and how to overcome it - here forsight emerges from a generic context of problem-solving and firming belief)

In a context of cultivation we utilise discernment. Commentary

In hexagram 18, as hexagram 17 symbolizes a natural degeneration, so hexagram 18 symbolizes degeneration caused by spiritual neglect and the corrections required to fix the problem; the price of too much cultivation. (All four hexagrams,(17,18,27,28) deal with concepts of degeneration and methods of regeneration. These are consequences of the transition of time and are associated with their corresponding base trigrams of transition). Hexagram 18 is the general form of hexagram 58

Image :

"[With self-reflection comes trust] : [Deference] Above a marsh there is earth : Approach. To reflect, one uses teaching exhaustively. To protect the common people, one uses unbounded tolerance."
Commentary

In hexagram 19 we find a time of deference for the high(top trigram) and a time of easy approach for the low(bottom trigram); not a time for the high to stand one's ground even if appearing 'balanced' . The 'high' is generous and aids and teaches the low. (There is a very obvious difference in lines 1-3 and lines 4-6 when we read the traditional line comments (see below).

In a context of devotion we utilise influence. Commentary

In hexagram 20 we are setting an example through one's presence; being admired. However we need to be weary of the possibility that the power of our presence can cause people to make decisions based on our point of view, not their own. Here it is not so much our actions to others that can cause the problem (as in this hexagram's complement - hexagram 34) but more our own spirit. (All four hexagrams (9,20,16,34) deal with the concept of personal power and it's influence as a function of the generic concept of seeking balance as symbolised by their base trigrams).

In hexagram 21, problems are solved through the establishment of laws as part of the process of moving from chaos, or an old established order (50), to order.

"[with guidance comes retainment]. Below mountain there is fire : [Facade]. One uses [the guidance/awareness] of the many regulations rather than dare to stop legal proceedings."
In a context of guidance we utilise discernment. Commentary

In hexagram 22 we find that facades can be important for social survival, but one must be weary of mistaking them for reality; There is at times a tendency to suck-out the inner light to prop up the outer. The context gives us the linking of words with facts (15) in the correct order (63) and thus establishing an attractive 'look' or attitude; linking things together generates 'value'.
The Traditional Single Changing Line Comments:

Line 1

"Only enhancing one's foundations and progressing just on those is more beneficial than using a full facade."
Line 2 "To achieve any progress it is beneficial to adopt a facade such that one appears in one's

In a context of devotion we utilise discernment. Commentary

In hexagram 23 we recognize that the establishment of history is an important part of social development. It enables the culture to have depth and firm ground to stand on and thus something to balance on. This sense of history, and therefore tradition, is fostered by studying the thoughts of old (26) as well as spiritual celebration. An imbalance can occur when the deeds of the past are interpreted as being relevant and superior to now. Spiritually, this can be a backward step and these thoughts should be discarded; only the core is retained. The context gives the return to the 'correct' path, together with uniting others around the core principles - seperating chaff from wheat - Pruning. (All four hexagrams (26,43,45,23) deal with the social past and it's influences on the now as part of the generic concept of balance seeking as symbolised by their base trigrams.)

In hexagram 24 we are at a point of crossing, symbolically from the dark(uncomfortable) to the light.

Commentary

In hexagram 25, to express one's self strongly and openly and unexpectedly is an act of innocence since it comes from the heart and thus is not premeditated ( a moment of enlightenment). To escape from the dark side, the side of service, requires an initial act; one needs to do something and get involved with the new and disentangled from the old.

In a context of perseverence we utilise discernment. Commentary

In hexagram 26 we recognize that by studying and accumulating things of the past, one is able to develop a sense of balance; the power of tradition. This, however, forms a restraint, but of the social kind rather than self restraint (52).

In hexagram 27 we recognize that nourishment is a vital part of generation, without it we die. But it does not need to have meaning, it just needs to be filling; be warned. Contextually, a degree of devotion and openness develops into a difficult beginning and one hungers for information.

In hexagram 28 we learn that in the process of regeneration one must be weary of going to far, for in becoming too full we lead to the path of decay.

This hexagram also reflects the positive aspect of excess in the form of going beyond what is required. (The hexagram quartet 17,18,27,28 deals with the concepts of degeneration and regeneration.

29 / 18 The Abysmal, Water. Containing, Control (63->29->64->30)

"HSI K'AN HSI : Practise, rehearse, train, coach; again and again; familiar with, skilled; repeat a lesson, drive, impulse. The ideogram portrays wings and a cap. It suggests thoughts carried forward by repeated movements... K'AN : dangerous place; hole, cavity, hollow; pit, snare, trap, grave, precipice; critical time, test; risky. The ideogram: earth and pit" ERANOS p344

"[with containment comes overcoming(control)]. Flowing water arrives at the top. Repeated Pit. And teaches affairs through repetition.[Rote-Copying-it's safer]"
In a context of containment we utilise control. Commentary

In hexagram 29 we recognize that there is always the need to guide and protect; if not done properly we end up not complete. But what is security to some is danger to others and thus the concept of rote-learning is dangerous in that it is just filling the individual as a social requirement. The complement of this hexagram, 30, is also dangerous in that it can lead to the uncovering of 'facts' that may be socially unacceptable. Contextually we start with the concept of a soft center and a hard exterior (61) - the latter acting as a form of mask (04). From this emerges the concept of containment (e.g. 'social knowledge') as a form of control, and thus a continual awareness of the presence of danger. (Note that since none of the other hexagrams made-up of the same trigram in upper and lower positions have the word "HSI" in their names, it is assumed that it is of special significance in this hexagram. The more traditional systems seem to ignore this point. When

looking at the contextual hexagrams, we find that the hexagram immediatly prior to 29 is 04, which deals with social 'masking' and education, thus reinforceing the refined educational aspects within 29.) Hexagram 29 is the general form of hexagram 14

Image :

"[With guidance comes (a sense of) direction/directing] Brightness doubled generates radiance. One uses continuous brightness (guidance) to illuminate (become aware of) the direction of the four point of the compass."
Commentary

The idea of 30 is given in the cycle, (64->30->63->29), where a failure to complete(64) implies the need for a guide (30). Once found, completion is successful (63). But once successful the guiding principles become taught by rote (29) and thus we get back to failure (64). (failure is more 'mis-sequencing' than 'failing'). Contextually, we emerge in a state of over emphasizing (62 - acting/portraying) and this develops into the ability to stripping things away, revealing the underneath (49) - and thus the shining light of the intellect as a guide and developer of direction. As the comment on line 6 shows, we can happily chop-off the head in this process of analysis and revealing 'truth'. (All four hexagrams (29,30,63,64) deal with the concept of protection and getting things in correct order, either with the defensive contractive bias of 29 or the expansive use of guidance in 30. This correlates with the concept of bounding(making distinctions) manifest in the base trigrams; as you follow a path a map is useful.). Hexagram 30 is the general form of hexagram 08

"[With self restraint comes intensity] Above mountain there is marsh. Influence (Come into contact with). One uses emptiness to make peace with people."
In a context of self-restraint we utilise intensity. Commentary

In hexagram 31, The seeking of satisfaction has become concentrated in that one has found what one wants or fits with. By initially putting oneself in a giving position one can thus stimulate the other. The line text is partially a step by step description of one rising to speak. The emphasis is on the intent and purpose of the act, putting it all together to make a whole. Contextually, we develop from a loose associating (13) through a stronger degree of loyalty but at a distance (56) to a refined, but restrained, degree of joining. (All four hexagrams (58,31,52,41) deal with attaining satisfaction as implied by their base trigrams associated with submission/self-restraint. There is thus an overall bias to concentration in a literal and metaphoric senses; concentration allowed 'outwards' comes across as intenseness)

Image :

"[With cultivation comes awareness]. Thunder, Wind. Persevering (Constancy). One uses (permanency) rather than continuous change."
In the context of cultivation we utilise awareness. Commentary

Hexagram 32 is the point of balance between the two main hexagrams of transition (51,57). We are as far away as possible from the moment of transition. We experience duration in a social context of an enduring relationship; the idea of commitment. Contextually, we develop from a raw sense of direction (14) that becomes seductive (44), leading to wholehearted commitment. (The four hexagrams (51,32,42,57) deal with the cyclic nature of transitions. As influenced by their base trigrams).

Image :

"[With self restraint comes confidence] Below heaven we have mountain. Withdrawal. One distances oneself from 'small' people using neither hate nor intimidation."
In a context of self-restraint we utilise singlemindedness. Commentary

In hexagram 33 we find that deference to the enemy through a structured retreat is the best path. This is a form of trickary, where we lead the enemy into believing we are retreating, only to return at another more opportune time. Contextually, we combine pulling away (49) with pretending (62), leading to apparent withdrawl.
The Traditional Single Changing Line Comments:

Line 1

Withdrawing one's tail, danger. No advantage in having a direction. [Pretending to withdraw is not advised, even if you can escape. Besides, your position is still influencial.]

"[With devotion comes direction]. Light over the Earth. [Attraction]. One uses natural guidance [devotion to] to brighten one's 'Way' (tao)."
In a context of devotion we utilise setting a direction (an ideology). Commentary

In hexagram 35 we find that when one's presence is not yet influencial, one must still persevere. This is done through 'purification' of the self, hopeful for the moment of recognition (8). This progress is noticeable (51) and highly attracting (45). Both in benefit and adversity - (read the line comments.)

"[with guidance comes trust] The light enters the centre of the earth[moves up]. Hiding the Light. One oversees the people to know when to darken and lighten."
NOTE: In one of the alternative titles, The term 'calling pheasant' implies trickery, hiding one's true nature. Another title is 'bright pheasant'. The latter describes an excellent official who attempts to get the message across to his ruler but is totally ignored. This act of ignorance manifests the darkening of light; light in the inner position manifests guidance.
In the context of guidance we utilise trust. Commentary

In hexagram 36 we find that at times it is necessary to control expressing one's point of view, especially when there is no other likeminded people around. In this siutuation it is best to keep the light within as you find that your guidance is ignored; best to observe when to advice and when to be quiet (as the image says). Contextually we come from a degree of selfrestraint (52) and rigid structure (37) to an uncompromising position. The complement of this hexagram is hexagram 06, Conflict or the concept of compromise, meeting halfway. This hexagram, 36, symbolizes a bias to no compromise.

Image :

"[With guidance comes influence] : The Clan. One uses words to [influence] people as well as direction to [influence] commitment."
In the context of guidance we utilise influence. Commentary

In hexagram 37 we find that release from tension need not be explicit. For example, here a man returns to his family/clan where there is no tension in that each member of the family speaks the same language and fulfills their role - mother is mother, father is father, first son is first son etc - the social structure is rigid. Benefically, this creates a tension free environment - no competition - such that when a family member returns from a tension creating situation, the tension is released just by walking in the door. There is an association with 'communicating' in that within the family or clan, we all speak the same language. This is a relaxing influence; when one has travelled in foreign lands it is good to sometimes hear one's own language. The subtle influence here is the concept of everything being in the 'exactly correct' place and thus a degree of tension release. However, this degree of structuring is also inflexable and we find the contextual roots of obstruction and uncompromising states leading into rigidity.

Image :

"[With self-reflection comes direction : Mirroring] One uses harmony as well as difference."
In a context of self-reflection we utilise a sense of direction (an ideology). Commentary

In hexagram 38 we find that the adoption of a facade can ensure that one can follow their own path (which is here in direct opposition to 'out there') whilst appearing socially acceptable. Here a mirror is thrown-up such that those opposing see the individual as a reflection of themselves and the opposition diminishes. This is not a limitation imposed for development but more for survival. This can however lead to a degree of personal isolation; whereupon the mirror starts to work inwards (see line 6 comments below).

In hexagram 39 one is blocked in one's path, but this blockage is from within. It is therefore best to try and find an alternative route - bypass to overcome rather than conflict.

In hexagram 40 we have the explicit form of release from tension; the loosening of structure. The first flash of lightning and crack of thunder signalling the break of a storm. In the image, from a position of security one is able to forgive generously, and thus reduce tension. This is an explicit act of tension release, compared to the hexagram's complement, hexagram 37 The Family, where the implicit nature of the structured environment is relaxing; here it is the release of structure that works.

In hexagram 41 there is a double meaning implied, which is brought out by the term 'Reduce'. The hexagram implies, in a social context, the concentration of richness and poorness; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer. At the same time this is applied to the individual as combining selectivity with self reflection, and the act of taking a step back to reconsider something. All of this corresponds with the concepts of lessening or diminishing, since concentrating something implies lessening or diminishing something else. Contextually, we move from uniforming to standardizing and thus reduction. This duality is perhaps seen more if we make the interpretive distinction of opposition versus cooperation. The oppositional form gives this hexagram a reductionist flavour but in a deteriorating sense. The cooperative form gives this hexagram a reductionst flavour but with a qualitative refinement; a distillation.

"[Wtth enlightenment comes influence : Ascending] One ascends by seeing improvement and controlling excess."
Commentary

In hexagram 42 we find a moment given to understanding the cycles. We are far from the points of transition. We are in a position to see the cycles and thus to observe them and learn to use them to succeed (augment oneself) and avoid those that can do damage. This is a step up, a change from one level of refinement to the next; an increase in one's commitment to a path. Contextually, we combine uniting (drawing in) with coming back to the 'true' path and thus augmentation and ascendence.

"[With perseverence comes intensity : Resoluteness] By passing out benefits, one can reach below. By staying aloof one can keep to one's 'way'."
In a context of perseverence we utilise intensity. Commentary

Hexagram 43 is a long way from the use of tradition. We need to see inside ourselves to get through this. This can generate what some see as resoluteness and others see as arrogance. This total self development needs to be balanced by opening up to others. This is accomplished by 'spreading the word', analogous to taking cuttings from a plant to use elsewhere. Hexagram 43 is the specific form of hexagram 04

"[With cultivation comes Single-mindedness : Persuading/Seducing] The prince uses the aid of fate to command all."
In a context of cultivation we utilise singlemindedness. Commentary

In hexagram 44 we are crossing the border. It symbolises the way from the light to the passive and seductive dark. A point of potential and non-innocence far from the actual and innocent. It is the path from the firm to the yielding, emphasized in the image by the using of the concept of fate as a tool to control the people (i.e. "It is supposed to be this way, it is fated."). The line comments emphasize the concept of holding on to things possibly past their, or your, time; their apparent 'value' keeping the tie. Contextually, we are combining seeding with commitment.

Image :

"[With devotion comes intensity: Assembling] One eliminates all weapons to implement this. [As a result] guards are setup to warn [and protect]."
In a context of devotion we utilise intensity. Commentary

In hexagram 45 we find a social unit with strong traditional roots remains balanced. These spiritual foundations are celebrated, with the celebration itself acting as a boost to unity; enforcing the strength of the group. In the image, to avoid possible conflicts in these situations, all weapons are banned and, as a result, weapons as a precautionary tool no longer exist. This requires that guards be to be set to warn of possible dangers.
The Traditional Single Changing Line Comments:

Line 1

"Being not wholly sincere. Disorder because of it, grouping because of it. Similar to a little outcry that sets off laughter [within a crowd]. No concern. Move on without fault." [Lack of sincerity (immaturity at the beginning) leads to wasted energy. In a crowd concentrating on something, a sudden, and intentional, yelp can break the tension/spell. This shows a lack of sincerity but is done usually by the immature. So too, lack of sincerity can cause disorder as well as people grouping together for safety]

"[Letting oneself] be drawn is favourable, no harm in this. [Things are] balanced because of an advantageous, although limited, offering." [Imposing a self limitation by allowing outside forces to control(draw you)]

Image :

"[With cultivation comes trust : Involvement]. One uses flexability to follow one's way and small accomplishments to build great things."
In a context of cultivation we utilise trust. Commentary

In hexagram 46, through the conversion of small potentials into actuals, one has risen to a point of recognition. All of this achieved by willpower and innocence; acts of deep-seated involvement to the exclusion of everything else. This is the process of refinement; the act of distillation rather than the product itself. Contextually, we have held firm (26) and cultivated (57) leading to ascending and entanglement.

Image :

"[With containment comes intensity] : Confining. One is induced to follow fate to free one's will."
In a context of containment we utilise itensity. Commentary

In hexagram 47 one is not in a position to do anything about existing ideologies. One therefore needs to control(limit) one's attitude. Develop a facade until times change. This is more a behavioural facade than that of 22, in that we are penned in. In the ideogram this is symbolized by a tree closely surrounded by a fence. This implies forcing (Stimulating) the roots to go deep, a form of external control on the 'free will' of the tree. Another word for this situation is imprisonment. Contextually, we develop from the pressure of following a path (10) and getting the order incorrect (64), leading to enforced waiting. The positive side is the sinking of roots into the context and so integrating oneself into the environment.

Line 1 -

"One's seat is so confined it is like a stump of wood. [Withdrawing into himself]. For three years he sees no one." [Initial exposure to oppression can cause withdrawal, self reflection]

"[From cultivation comes overcoming] : The Well. One uses the working people to encourage unity."
In a context of cultivation we utilise control. Commentary

In hexagram 48, the establishment of a source of nourishment enables the passage from chaos to social order. This 'Well' is passive; its presence encourages people to congregate around it and develop, and thus its influence generates a sense of security and thus overcoming chaos. Contextually we mix making small gainings and correcting corruption into making foundations for the future. Hexagram 48 is the general form of hexagram 38

Commentary

In hexagram 49 we find that there are times when ideologies need to be changed. The opportunity has come for the change to occur. Let the outside reflect YOUR direction/ideology. This is like removing a facade, and letting the inner shine, rather than adopting one (22). In the image context, by creating a calendar the cycles of the heavens can be seen and predicted; we have revealed the inner workings.

"[With cultivation comes direction : Refining] One uses the ideal to set fate."
In a context of cultivation we utilise a sense of direction (an ideology). Commentary

In hexagram 50,the establishment of order out of chaos, the generation of social foundations, does not guarantee development, they just set up a suitable environment. To enable social development, these foundations need to be refined. In the image, the idea is to adopt a single point of view thus forcing 'fate' to appear fixed. Any form of controlling influence introduces a fixed set of possibilities and excludes others purely by definition alone. Contextually, inspiration and excess leads to transformation.
The Traditional Single Changing Line Comments:

Line 1 -

The overthrow (tien) of foundations (ting), removing 'stagnating stuff', but implicitly retaining the cooking pot in which the raw (unrefined - a concubine's son) can be cooked and refined. Even the most lowly can be refined and thus succeed.
Line 2 -

The foundations have some substance. By careful consideration one can benefit(develop) from this but one needs to be wary of the envy of others.
Line 3 -

The ability to grasp the foundations has been removed and despite the potential nourishment within it, we are unable to consume it. (Implied here is that this is a form of

protection in that the method of access has been removed, protecting the contents from the outside.) We must let this go (the phrase 'rain lessens repenting' implies water,tension release).

"[With enlightenment comes awareness : Arousing] One uses anxiety and fear to regulate watchfulness."
In a context of enlightenment, a new beginning, we utilise (sudden) awareness. Commentary

In hexagram 51 we are at the explicit moment when one detects a transition from stillness to movement. An arousing influence that inspires one to action. In the image, the feelings of anxiety and fear are enhanced in the people by the powers that be, such that any change in the environment will trigger these emotions and the change is thus quickly detected.

In the image, one is encouraged to to understand the wholeness of things and thus be able to detect something which is faulty, broken, or not yet ripe (Immature). The name emphasizes the continous return to basics (and thus no development); we keep doing the same things and getting nowhere. (Given by the context of treading a path combined with mis-sequencing). Hexagram 54 is the specific form of

"[With guidance comes awareness : Overflowing] One uses severe laws to enforce punishments."
In a context of guidance we utilise (sudden) awareness. Commentary

In hexagram 55, once one has reached a peak, it follows that we head towards the down cycle. Here, tension is at it's peak pending a conscious release and these 'social outbreaks' need controlling - An arousing influence with guidance. In the image, current ideologies have led to an outbreak of crimes which need to be contained. In the line comments, the continuing use of the term "Sun-centering", meaning midday, emphasizes reaching a peak. Hexagram 55 is the general form of hexagram 20

Image :

"[With self-restraint comes direction] : The Wanderer. One uses an enlighten and true heart in punishing and refrains from extended court cases."
In a context of self-restraint we utilise setting a direction (an ideology). Commentary

In hexagram 56 self-imposed limitations enable one to survive in any environment. It is excess that fosters obstruction and oppression. These limits should act as guides in the form of a sense of direction, not absolutes. Guided restraint/ restrained movement; when wandering in a strange land, one's loyalties are still with 'home' and thus one should be restrained (selective) in one's actions.

"[With cultivation comes influence] : The Gentle. One introduces subtlety in controlling affairs."
In a context of cultivation we utilise influence. Commentary

Hexagram 57 is a soft form of transition. A subtle controlling influence, through persuasion, forces one to adapt to the change conditions and therefore themselves change.

In a context of self-relfection we utilise intensity (self-reflection doubled). Commentary

Hexagram 58 is a hexagram symbolic of both intenseness and self-reflection. In the image, one joins one's business with businesses of others and thus speeds up the process of selling; increases one's market through joint ventures. (establishing a degree of intenseness).

In a context of containment we utilise influence. Commentary

In hexagram 59 a gentle change can be used to soften any defense mechanism. Once a crack appears the influence strengthens by slipping through the crack and working from within. This form of release is far more subtle and long term than 37/40 and is associated with the conscious (explicit man created) release of 55. It involves the concept of trust and penetrating defenses leading to the ability to clear things away - to dispell illusions.

"[With self-reflection comes overcoming(Control) : Standardizing] One uses analysis to create standards and the right words in following one's path."
In a context of self-reflection we utilise control. Commentary

In hexagram 60, self imposed limits are useful for development. they enable one to set reachable goals and to stretch the limits as well as set up standards by which one can compare progress. This form of discipline helps avoid possible obstruction and oppression. These limits are set from within (56,60) not from without (38,39). In the image, just as measurement standards are a form of limitation but beneficial, so is determining a 'best course' as one develops one's path. These standardization processes imply the concept of staying and reasoning things out; to seperate and distinguish.

In hexagram 61 apparent firmness hides a forgiving heart. This is the point of switching from firm to yielding in inner truth. The text symbolizes a judge (apparent firmness) protracting discussion due to a forgiving heart and thus "..delay[ing] executions". Capturing the heart(centre) and thus sympathizing.

"[With self-restraint comes awareness : Acting.] One uses excessive behaviour to show respect One uses excessive behaviour to mourn One takes advantage of excessive behaviour to show moderation."
In a context of self-restraint we utilise (sudden) awareness. Commentary

In hexagram 62 an emphasis on detail and over exaggerated conduct is sometimes required by those in positions of influence to help maintain traditional perspectives. This emphasis helps to maintain the 'ideal' in the eyes of the people. However, these behaviours can be used to hide a weak individual in that they work as a facade and can be used as an excuse for delays in decision making. In the image, moderation, respect, and mourning are usually acts manifesting a level of restraint. In this situation this behaviour is 'hammed up' (a context of guidance and trickary).

In a context of guidance we utilise control. Commentary

In hexagram 63 we find the successful end of a journey masks the beginning of another. The mask of completion helps memory to distinguish events and some form of guide is useful for the new dangers ahead.

"[With containment comes direction : Ordering]. One uses caution to categorize those everywhere."
In a context of containment we utilise setting a direction (an ideology). Commentary

In hexagram 64 we realize that seeing the end of something can make one hasten and not watch their step, just as being at the beginning of something can make one look to the end and not watch where they are going. Things need to be done in correct order to succeed. The image combined with the traditional title suggests that by not getting things in proper order (sequence), the successful completion of tasks is difficult and we thus need to set-out some sort of path/plan. In a positive vain the hexagram also manifests keeping oneself 'open' as long as possible, avoiding closure recognising the emphasis on dependencies and so a lack of 'completeness' in that completion is an illusion.

It is symbolic of perseverence when in the bottom position of a hexagram, and is symbolic of confidence/power when in the top position of a hexagram. In the template it is representative of expansive blending and thus an overall bias to seeking wholeness.

Symbol of self-reflection in the bottom position of a hexagram, and intensness when in the top position of a hexagram. One of the six 'mixed' trigrams, symbolic of the interaction of degrees of yin and yang.

Earth AKA The Receptive

Symbol of pure yin. It is the half of the whole symbolized by T'ai Chi, and is thus an extreme state that requires to link with it's opposite half, Yang (The trigram called "Heaven" or "The Creative") to restore balance. It is symbolic of devotion when in the bottom position of a hexagram, and is symbolic of trust when in the top position of a hexagram. In the template it is representative of contractive blending and thus an overall bias to seeking wholeness. (balance) In the Myers-Briggs/Keirsey systems of persona classification it is linked to XNFP/Advocates and is mostly concerned with identity seeking and thus intagrating inner and outer to become 'one'. (balance) (e.g. Seekers, Enthusiasts, Questors - it is the establishment (or re-establishment) of balance 'inside' that is seeked. This is often done through following of a creed or charismatic individual) The numeric link is with whole numbers.

Spacial and Temporal links in the traditional I Ching sequences This article deals with semantic groupings in the ‘traditional’ listing, demonstrating the directional (temporal) aspects of the King Wen Sequence compared to the structural aspects of the Fu Hsi sequence and how grouping these pairings forms a consistent pattern of meaning. The pairings we find in the King Wen sequence reflect the temporal (directional) aspects of the hexagrams and these pairs are what we see in the 'traditional' numbered sequence used by Wilhelm etc. The pairings we find in the Fu Hsi sequence reflect the structural (spacial) aspects of the hexagrams. In these sequences so there are pairings that reflect BOTH aspects in the single pair. There are eight of these. In what follows are presented all of the pairings, giving both the spacial and temporal characteristics of these pairs. The overall emphasis for the directional patterns is the distinction of begin/end; raw/refined.

01, 02
This is the first of eight groups where the structural and directional patterns are the same for each hexagram. In this case the directional complements (top to bottom, bottom to top) are indistinguishable, or more so that they overlap. Hexagram 01 covers the concept of perseverance and single-mindedness whereas hexagram 02 covers the concept of devotion and double-mindedness. These distinctions can be seen as directional in that perseverance doubled expresses developing single-mindedness, and devotion doubled expresses developing double-mindedness. The structural emphasis is the expansive emphasis of hexagram 01, and the contractive emphasis of hexagram 02. With these sorts of hexagrams so the overall form contains BOTH the structural and directional aspects.

03, 04 49, 50
This group of four hexagrams deal with raw beginnings (03, 04) and resulting ends (49, 50). Hexagram 03 emphasises difficult beginnings as we start-out on a new endeavour. Hexagram 04 complements this directionally in that the imposed education process also has difficulties at the beginning. Hexagram 49 is the refinement of 04 in that we have the skill to reveal the hidden (and transform). Hexagram 50 is also refinement in that these raw processes lead to transformations.

05, 06 35, 36
This group of four hexagrams deals with advancement The directional form of 05, 06 emphasises compromise or perhaps a bett er phrase is ‘holding back’; the ‘waiting’ of 05 and the ‘compromising’ of 06.

The directional form of 35, 36 emphasises uncompromise; no ‘holding back’; the ‘progressing’ of 35 and the ‘uncompromising’ of 36.

11, 12
This is the second of eight groups where the distinction of structural and directional are the same hexagrams. The dynamic perspective is hexagram 11 dealing with harmonising and so balancing. Hexagram 12 does the same but in an oppositional context in that it captures the process of neutralising opposition. The structural perspective is an emphasis on peace (11) and standstill (12). This emphasises a degree of stillness for both, but with hexagram 11 having potentials whereas 12 does not.

13, 14 07, 08
This group of four hexagrams deals with organisational concepts.

15, 16 09, 10
This pair - 15, 16 - covers the directional aspects in that 15 is the act of evening things out – levelling, and so the concept of modesty through reducing highs and lows. Hexagram 16 does the same thing but uses foresight and planning as it’s methods and so reducing having to deal with ‘sudden’ extremes – all is prepared for. The pair of 09, 10 cover directional aspects in that 09 is the act of making small gains by accumulating things and so ‘lifting’ oneself. Hexagram 10 does the same thing but by following a path. Structural aspects are covered in the consideration of the 15, 10 relationship and the 16, 09 relationship.

17, 18
This is the third of eight groups where the distinction of structural and directional are the same hexagrams. Hexagram 17 deals with establishing a belief system and following it. Hexagram 18 complements this by using feedback to correct the corruptions that can emerge from 17 (and so 18 goes in the opposite direction)

19, 20 33, 34

This group of four hexagrams deals with motivational concepts. (hex 33 deals with retreat but in a context of tricking the opposition and so there a motive for the act).

21, 22 47, 48
This group of four hexagrams deals with regulatory (containment) concepts.

23, 24 43, 44
Hexagram 23 deals with the concept of pruning, of cutting back to the bedrock and so ‘pure’, fundamentalist’ levels – the one ‘true’ way. Hexagram 24 deals with the concept of returning to the one ‘true’ way in the face of many distractions that appear in the form of other paths to follow. 23 leads from the general to the specific whereas 24 leads from the specific to the general. Hexagram 43 deals with the concept of seeding, of spreading the word in a direct, concentrated and robust manner. Hexagram 44 deals with the concept of persuading/seducing, of spreading the word in a more subtle way. The structural links for these are in that 23,43 oppose each other as do 24,44. The other form of opposition is in direction and in this context so 23 opposes 24 and 43 opposes 44.

25, 26 45, 46
This group of four hexagrams deals with entanglements. The 25, 26 pair emphasise dis-entanglements through breaking-free (25) or not getting entangled in the first place (26) The complements are in the 45, 46 pair which stress entanglements in forming congregations (45) or else ascending in the organisation (46)

27, 28
This is the fourth of eight groups where the structural and temporal aspects are combined. Hexagram 27 covers the concept of hungering (seeking nourishment - underweight) whereas hexagram 28 covers the concept of exceeding (overweight).

29, 30
This is the fifth of eight groups where the structural and temporal aspects are combined. Hexagram 29 emphasises containment and control, whereas hexagram 30 emphasises guidance and establishing a sense of direction.

In the structural aspect so 30 manifests a dependency (fire needs to burn something) whereas 29 manifests another dependence in that water will flow everywhere unless contained. There seems to be an emphasis on fire spreading outwards/upwards and water spreading downwards.

31, 32 41, 42
This group of four hexagrams deals with concentrated commitment concepts. Hexagram 31 emphasises a journey of increasing commitment compared to 32 that starts with commitment. Hexagram 41 emphasises increasing concentration, both literal and metaphoric, whereas 42 emphasises augmentation and so a stated of refinedness ‘at the start’.

37, 38 39, 40
This group of four hexagrams deals with rigid and relaxed structuring and the overall emphasis on tension release. Hexagram 37 manifests the dynamic of a formal structure that can reduce tension, with hexagram 38 manifesting the use of mirroring, of letting others see themselves ‘in’ you. Hexagram 39 emphasises the bypassing of obstructions, together with 40 that emphasises relaxing of structure.

51, 52 57, 58
This group of four hexagrams deals with forms of realisation. Hexagram 51 emphasises the use of awareness from enlightenment, whereas 52 reflects a similar outcome based on self-restraint leading to discernment. Hexagram 57 emphasises cultivation and the development of influence, whereas 58 covers the same outcome through self-reflection leading to intensity.

53, 54
This is the sixth of eight groups where the structural and temporal aspects are combined. The emphasis is on relational developments in the form of a gradual structured build-up (53) versus an intense unstructured/’unusual’ expression (54). The latter ‘starts’ with high energy that goes on to ‘fade away’ whereas the former starts haltingly but then develops.

55, 56

59, 60
This group of four hexagrams deals with limitations and crossing boundaries. 59 manifests dispelling illusions to make things clear, whereas 60 manifest the same process by establishing standards. 55 manifests the reaching of a limit, abundance, but not crossing it, as does 56 in the form of being a traveller and so limiting one’s behaviour by staying ‘true’.

61, 62
This is the seventh of eight groups where the structural and temporal aspects are combined. Hexagram 61 emphasises a position that is yielding and a developing advocate-biased, compared to 62 that reflects starting in this state to a degree where it is exaggerated.

63, 64
This is the eighth of eight groups where the structural and temporal aspects are combined. The predominance here is order in that 63 manifests ‘correct’ ordering compared to 64 that manifests ‘incorrect’ ordering.

The Hexagram Quartets

We here summarize the sets of hexagrams that form balanced hexagram pairs as discussed in the text. The sequence is based on the following cyclic algorithm discusses in timelines. The generic mixing terms are translated into more specific terminology and the hexagram names are those from Wilhelm (1951):

The Creative The Receptive Peace Standstill

In this group hexagram 1 is moving towards hex 11 and visa versa. Hexagram 2 is moving towards hexagram 12 and visa versa. Hexagram 1 is concerned with establishing balance/harmony by pouring out, it's goal is to achieve the state symbolized by hexagram 11, peace (as in balanced). This peace, however, is a peace filled with potential, for tomorrow is another day, and so the cycle is from 11 to 1.
Hexagram 2 is concerned with establishing balance/harmony by sucking in, it's goal is to achieve the state symbolized by hexagram 12, standstill. This is a form of peace but with no potentials, no tomorrow. It is treated negatively within the I Ching since the I Ching is bias to movement. What is seeked here is the sensation of movement, but not death, just a form of being without the potential of doing, a firming of one's beliefs as all outside criticisms are 'parried' and neutralized. If we ignore the movement scenarios, then the hexagram pair of 11 and 12 (Stillness) form the balancing pair to the hexagram pair 01 and 02 (Movement). PROTECT ------CHANGE

In this group hexagram 3 is moving towards hexagram 21 and hexagram 50 is moving towards hexagram 48 and visa versa for both.

Ignoring the movement scenarios, the hexagrams in this set deal with the establishment of foundations. These can be achieved through movement or stillness. The movement option is symbolised by the hexagram pair 03,50 and the stillness option by hexagrams 21,48. At the same time we have the concepts of 03 and 50 being foundationless at the start compared to the start of 21,48 which establishes foundations first.

In this group hexagram 4 is moving towards hexagram 47 and hexagram 49 is moving towards hexagram 22 and visa versa for both. Ignoring the movement scenarios, the hexagrams in this set deal with the imposition of ideologies. The movement option is symbolized by the pair 04,49 and the stillness option by the pair 22 and 47. At the same time we have the change of ideologies symbolized in 04,49 and the hiding from ideologies symbolized in 22,47.

In this group, hexagram 5 is moving towards hexagram 14 and hexagram 35 is moving towards 8 and visa versa for both. Ignoring the movement scenarios, the hexagrams in this set deal with the centre of attention. 05,35 symbolize the waiting prior to becoming and 08,14 symbolize the being. At the same time 05,35 symbolize the movement of external forces out of one's control compared to the incorporation of these forces within oneself and thus aiding one's control as in 08,14 - centered stillness.

Ignoring the movement scenarios, these hexagrams deal with the concepts of likeminded and unlikeminded. 06 and 36 symbolize the actions(movements) required to deal with a time when one is alone amongst unlikeminded. Hexagrams 07 and 13 symbolize the 'entities' of likeminded groups (still).

Ignoring the movement scenarios, these hexagrams deal with the concept of innocence. The knowledge of the light and the dark sides reflected in 24,44 compared to the lack of knowledge within 25,46. 24 and 44 have within them the concept of 'been this way before'. The boarder line is known. 25 and 46 do not know that a boarder exists nor want to be involved; they just 'push on'.

Time cycles and the I Ching

THE TIMELINE.

A hexagram is not a static form. It symbolizes a moment of frozen time. As time moves on so the hexagram changes. The full cycle of change is from a hexagram to it's structural opposite. But there are steps inbetween; There are points of balance. For each hexagram, one can locate it's movement by:(1) Interpreting the current state as a point of balance.

(2) Assigning the top trigram position as FUTURE, and the bottom trigram position as PAST. Each trigram has either evolved from it's opposite (Bottom) , or, is evolving into it's opposite (top).

(3) The current hexagram's PAST trigram has therefore evolved from it's opposite. Create a hexagram with the current top trigram over the opposite of the base trigram. This is where we have come from or are moving away from.

(4)

The current hexagram's FUTURE trigram is therefore evolving into it's opposite. Create a hexagram with the current bottom trigram under the opposite of the current top trigram. This is where we are going or moving towards.

(5) If we group all the sets we find that we can create sets of four hexagrams that cover full circles e.g.

01 --> 11 --> 12 --> 02 --> 01 ...

Each pair of complements are the balance points of the other pair. e.g. [01,02] complement and therefore balance [11,12]. [11,12] are the structural balance points of the trigrams within [01,02]. The relationship of each set to the other can be treated both structurally and procedurally; the latter manifest in a movement around the circle and the former as one pair opposite and therefore balancing the other:
01 | | 11--------+--------12 | | 02

There is a common theme here in that these two modes of interpretation (balance/circumvent) are reflected in the traditional diagrams of early(opposite/balance/still) and late(circumvent/move) heaven, and continue the manifestation of the structural and the procedural wrapped into one. By adding the concept of time, we can map these circles in the form of sine waves. In this we find that, for any set of pairs, the direction of movement changes. For example, in the pair 1,2 the direction of movement is left to right (Clockwise on the circle), whereas in the pair 11,12 the movement is right to left(Anti-Clockwise on the circle), although the order of the hexagrams is fixed for both. The sine wave is a template onto which we can place hexagram sequences. We can form a 12 point template thus:

*04 / \ / \

*03 / / *02 /

*05 \ \

*06 \ / \ / --*01---------------*07---------------*01-/ \ / \ / *08 *12 \ / \ / *09 *11 \ / \ / *10 A sine wave template

Having derived the quartet patterns, one can insert other hexagrams within the sequence. For example, in the group (1,2,11,12) which is ordered 12 <-> 01 <-> 11 <-> 02, we can introduce hexagrams that are structurally inbetween the primary hexagrams of the group. This gives us the sequence (left to right) 12,33,44,01,43,34,11,19,24,02,23,20,12,... We find that this specific sequence infact consists of the twelve hexagrams traditionally associated with the seasons, the standard order of which is 19,11,34,43,01,44,33,12,20,23,02,24. In this sequence January is associated with hexagram 19 and December associated with hexagram 24 (Northern Hemisphere). This sequence 'maps' onto the sine wave starting at position 8 for hexagram 19, and then moves right to left, backwards in our language. It is possible to create a sequence for each group of four hexagrams, which, as we will see, gives us a unique ordering of the hexagrams onto which can be overlaid the sine wave. Using the sine wave, the maxima (peak) and minima (trough) are associated with the current pair under review, with the 'balanced' pair being on the x-axis. The sine wave acts as a template of time in order of :
balance-increase-peak-decrease-balance-decrease-trough-increase-balance

The increase/decrease markers are reversible on direction. Having come up with the sets of four hexagrams, I recalled a diagram and some comments regarding 'mutating hexagrams'. This is in chapter 9 of Diana ffarington Hook's book "The I Ching and Mankind". She gives as her reference the work of W.A.Sherrill titled "Heritage of Change" (I have some of his work with W.K.Chu but not this text). The diagram used gives the order for hexagram 01 as:
01,44,33,12,20,23,02,24,19,11,34,43,01.

As we can see, this is the same order as I have used but with a different start point, it moves backwards, and there is no sinosodial emphasis. By mapping to a sine wave the cycle of behaviour becomes more apparent. Note that this sequence moves backwards whereas in my sequence, for 01, we move forwards. Closer examination shows that Sherrill's sequence results from the changing of line position values, one at a time, from the bottom up through a full cycle (originating hexagram to originating hexagram). For example in Hook/Sherrill's sequence for hexagram 11 the same process as for 01 is performed, starting with a root hexagram, each line is changed from the bottom up giving a sequence of hexagrams.i.e.
11 ,46,15,02,16,45,12,25,10,01,09,26,11 root change line: 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6

Change line 1 of 11 gives 46. Change line 2 of 46 gives 15 etc. Hook/Sherrill's diagram gives this pattern for all hexagrams as roots. The sine wave sequences are subtly different in that some work top down (e.g. the 01 set) and others bottom up. Furthermore, there is a variation of this in that the group analysis work shows sets of 4 hexagrams that can join other sets. For example, in the 1,2,10,12 set, group analysis shows (see chapter 1 page 20) an association with the 10,15,19,33 set. This suggests an eight point sine wave:

*01 / \ / \ / *15 / / \ *19 \ \

start / \ / --*12-------------*11-------------*--/ \ / \ / \ / *10 *33 \ / \ / \ / *02 An eight point sine wave template

This reflect the 'flow' of highs and lows. As the wave moves to the left (or right) the next point becomes the maxima and it's complement the minima. (e.g. In the above, if the wave moves left one point then 15 becomes the maxima and it's complement 10 the minima. This causes the other balancing pair, 19 and 33, to take on the 'balance' points on the 'x' axis replacing 11 and 12).

From this analysis we can create a full sequence:
12, 15, 01, 19, 11, 10, 02, 33, 12,...

From the group analysis, the above numbers associate with the BALANCE line of the groups. This is complemented by the LIKENESS line. Therefore we can create a sixteen hexagram sequence:
12,15,01,19,11,10,02,33,12 44,07,25,36,24,13,46,06,44 44,12,07,15,25,01,36,19,24,11,13,10,46,02,06,33,44,...

For now I will continue with the sine wave as I have mapped it. I place the balance hexagrams along the x-axis. With Sherrill's concepts, I have added the relevant sequence to the details on each hexagram, and it is of interest to note that Sherrill's sequences can be mapped to the sine wave with the same behaviour in that each point on the y-axis (vertical) when extended through the wave has two intersect points that are numerically in sequence ((11,12), (44,43) etc). To get Sherrill's sequences (which are relative to each hexagram rather than groups of balanced fours) to map to a sine wave and maintain the balance concepts, we allocate the 12 sine wave positions in the following order for all of Sherrill's sets:
04 03 02 01 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 ..

This methodology categorizes the current hexagram and it's complement as the maxima/minima regardless of their 'fixed' nature. Furthermore, if we take the sequence associated with hexagram pair 1,2 as a template, then each hexagram in each sequence is that sequence's 'mirror' of the template. For example, in the first sequence, hexagram 19 (Approach) symbolizes January if we interpret the sequence as the set of calendar hexagrams. In this context, in any sequence, the hexagram at sine position 08 relates to the whole sequence as does the january hexagram to the other calendar hexagrams (the near end of winter prior to the crossing (11 - stillness with potential) into the coming summer. This path moves backwards. At the height of summer (01) the return of winter is the return of the contractive (yin) through 44 and then 33 and then the crossing into the winter phase through 12 (Stillness only) heading down to 02. To use the southern hemisphere we just need to swap the calendar associations (19 becomes associated with July.). In this context, the sequence for hexagram 03 has hexagram 30 in the sine's 08 position. Prior to crossing into the 'easier' ground (through 14 - management) we have a guide. For each sequence, therefore, mapping it onto the sine wave, the sine positions 01 and 07 are interpreted as the crossover points for the sequence.) A possible wave nature for events can be the unification of different wave phases.

There is a circular trigram arrangement credited to King Wen. This is cyclic in form in that one starts in the sign of the Arousing and moves clockwise. This format seems to be derived from an ancient I Ching commentary (The Shuo Kua - Discussion of the Trigrams) in which paragraph 5 reads:
"5. God comes forth in the sign of the Arousing; he brings things to completion in the sign of the Gentle; he causes creatures to perceive one another in the sign of the Clinging(light); he causes them to serve one another in the sign of the Receptive. He gives them joy in the sign of the Joyous; he battles in the sign of the Creative; he toils in the sign of the Abysmal; he brings them to perfection in the sign of Keeping Still."

This quote is from R.Wilhelm's translation (p268). Other translations interpret 'God' to read 'Lord' or 'Sage' and there is an extended version of the first statement which reads " [God] comes forth, with his creation, in the sign of the Arousing". As we shall see the commentary comes into it's own when we use the binary sequence together with the MBTI and the extended version of the first phrase will seem the more appropriate.

Wholes, aspects, and the Genetic Code

Axiom: the derivation of amino acid codes in RNA and DNA develops within the dichotomy of purines/pyramidines. These are initial, and highly speculative, notes on genetic coding. The full map is not included here since it requires all 6 levels of the template to manifest itself fully. The template is discussed in the text on dichotomy. Over the years a few publications have emerged noting the ease of making analogy between the sixty-four hexagrams of the I Ching and the sixty-four possible codes that occur in the genetic code for the linking of amino acids. (refs given at end of this page). The following introduces the wholes/aspects perspective to the analysis of the coding, working on the premise that the 'universal' concept of whole/aspects must manifest itself in the sequences; details on the inclusion of the I Ching follows this section.
DNA/RNA sequencing

There is a strong suggestion that in the DNA/RNA system in humans we have: DNA - storage. (form bias - hierarchic structure (all contexts)) RNA - transfer and encoding/decoding. (aspectual bias - single context(gene))

A gene is cut from various parts of the storage area (DNA) and made into one gene sequence (mRNA). This passes through to the ribosomes where the sequence is read and matched to a free transfer codon (tRNA) that has attached an amino acid. This amino acid is tagged on to a growing amino acid chain that is the protein. In the genetic code there is one start codon and three stop codons, with each codon being madeup of a three letter code sequence that is derived from four possible letters.

Strings of amino acid codes (using RNA codes of AUCG or DNA of ATCG)

Some possibilities: Either (1) A string is context free in that each bit is independent of the previous bit and only serves a function that appears in the whole.

ACCACA

Or (2) A string is context dependent in that each bit is dependent on the previous bits.

ACCACA this sequence functions differently to that in (1).

Thus, in any amino acid sequence which has several different code sequences, there is the implication that the same amino acid could work differently depending on context and this is set by the code. Using the mixing template and the whole/parts dichotomy we can assign amino acid codons to generic 'meanings'. This is a simple one:one mapping that has no meaning at this time outside of the mapping. Implied in this are the following groupings based on the template positions at level 6 of the template derived from applying the pyramidine/purine dichotomy:
Static-----------------------------------------------------Dynamic Wholes Parts-to-Whole Relate. (static aspects) Parts Transition/ Transformation (dynamic aspects)

AAA ACA ATA AGA CAA CCA CTA CGA TAA TCA TTA TGA GAA GCA GTA GGA

Lys Thr Ile Arg Gln Pro Leu Arg (STOPochre) Ser Leu (STOPopal) Glu Ala Val Gly

AAC ACC ATC AGC CAC CCC CTC CGC TAC TCC TTC TGC GAC GCC GTC GGC

Asn Thr Ile Ser His Pro Leu Arg Tyr Ser Phe Cys Asp Ala Val Gly

AAT ACT ATT AGT CAT CCT CTT CGT TAT TCT TTT TGT GAT GCT GTT GGT

Asn Thr Ile Ser His Pro Leu Arg Tyr Ser Phe Cys Asp Ala Val Gly

AAG ACG ATG AGG CAG CCG CTG CGG TAG TCG TTG TGG GAG GCG GTG GGG

Lys Thr Met(START) Arg Gln Pro Leu Arg (STOPamber) Ser Leu Trp Glu Ala Val Gly

The last member of the codon gives a clue to the overall explicit context of the codon and the first member gives the root context:
A - wholes C - part-to-whole relationship (static aspects) T/U - parts (which can be 'wholes' at a different level of analysis) G - change (transition/transformation) (dynamic aspects)

Using this information we can analyse codon changes. For example, the sickle -cell mutation, a deformity of blood cell structure, results from the change of a single base in a codon. This change is from an A to T/U (GAA to GUA). In the above classifications, we have gone from a whole to a part within the explicit context of a whole (xxA) developed within the root context of change (Gxx). The amino acid codes listed above are in binary order. That is, using the template, they start at the contractive end (AAA) and finish at the expansive end (GGG) of level 6 of the template. If this is of value or not is unknown, but the 'fact' that we can map an external coding system to a human coding system is interesting. There is a faint possibility that there is 'something' going on since the DNA/RNA coding system is strongly based on dichotomy. The question is whether our classification of DNA/RNA results fron our method of classification or whether our method of classification is an extention of 'nature'. Life refines the basics despite the complexity of the system. Of interest to the reader may be my observation, based on the published sequences of three genes, two human and one mammal (mouse), that within the coding sequence (intron area) there was a marked reduction in the number of amino acid codes that I have classified as 'Whole' biased. In the non-coding areas there seemed to be no strong difference. However, these 'results'

could have been due to chance or a specific attribute of the genes that caused their sequences to be published. This all warrents further investigation. One of the main elements in DNA/RNA is Carbon, and considering the discussion in this site on dichotomy, a look at the element, so strongly connected with life, shows some interesting characteristics.
Carbon - a chemical dichotomy.

What has been explicitly described so far is the emergence of a rich reality from the 'middle' space of any dichotomy. I have suggested that there is a fundamental process at work and thus our intuitive use of dichotomous analysis in our making of maps. The question arises as to whether our maps are thus highly personal or whether we have adapted to the environment by internalizing one of it's fundamental characteristics - dichotomization and thus our maps have some value outside of our heads. (especially 'public' maps which are based on a high degree of 'consensus' to make the maps as easy to read as possible - they are kept generic enough to allow for a large number of possible interpretations that still lead to the same 'conclusions' - X is west/left of Y. The template allows for this format and thus we find the rich 'generic' nature of the dichotomously-derived esoteric typologies.) Of note is that some of the models of reality developed within physics continue to manifest this emergent property and one of the strongest models to date is that of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, besides being the 'flavour of the month' in physics, is the main tool used in chemestry and it is in chemestry that we find a shining example of dichotomous 'emergence' in the form of the carbon atom. In chemestry, it is the outer shell of an atom that is concerned with the mixing of elements. This shell is restricted to having a maximum of eight electrons in it. The first five shells within the classification system follow the sequence 2 - 8 - 8 - 18 - 32... Thus the 18-shell only starts to fill up with more than 8 when the 32 shell is first created (with one electron). This is a function of maintaining stability and stresses the maximum-of-8-in-the-outer-shell rule. (The 'noble gases', that do not combine with anything, all have the maximum 8 electrons in their outer shells). What is of interest (as far as life is concerned) is that the carbon atom has four electrons in it's outer shell and is found to be one of the most chemically active elements around within the context of possible variety as well as maintaining stability. It is this ability that leads to the emergence of carbon-based life forms since it is this ability that allows for a high degree of variation and thus the forming of complex structures. (The simplest organic material are hydrocarbons - combination of hydrogen and carbon atoms). In Carbon, note that the number of electrons in the out shell are at the mid-point between the possible range of outer shell electrons (1-to-8). We can symbolize this dichotomously as min/max; 'rich reality' emerges from the middle:

min/max ^ 'emergence'

This emergence is a natural phenomena and correlates with the mid point allowing for the highest degree of possible states. But, since this is the midpoint it suggests that a dualistic bias would be a 'natural' aspect, since all emergent states would be framed within the initial gross context of a 50/50 split. As far as 'perception' is concerned, it would be favourable to maximize our abilities and thus the emergence of this 'balanced' point of view would be natural; Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety the system with the most choices, rules. Considering the concept of the Context Ratio, the initial frame (1) is akin to the above emergence but where there is no dependence. The development of hierarchy emerges when previous text and context becomes the context for the next degree of emergence and thus we have the most primitive form of hierarchic development in the form of the fibonacci sequence; a rather common developmental attribute found in many lifeforms. All of this suggests that the most common lifeforms in the universe would be carbon-based, or else based on an element with four electrons in the outer shell:
1 2-4 (carbon - non metal) 2-8-4 (silicon - metalloid) 2-8-8-4 (germanium - metal) etc

This takes us back to the requisite variety concept (the system with the most choices controls the situation) and suggests that the concensus approach to map-making is akin to the allowing for as many possibilities that will still maintain the stability/integrity of the whole. And we find that the only state in which we can maximize the potential choices is in the 50/50 split. Going from the micro to the macro, another example is Hubble's Law. Using a dichotomy of Speed of Recession / Distance, we find that the galaxies in the universe end-up bunched along the midpoint; this is in fact a 'map' of the expansion of the universe - a map of change. This law was derived by Hubble using a property of waves, specifically lightwaves in that moving away objects are seen as redshifted and coming towards as blueshifted; another dichotomy in which 'reality' would occupy the middle space, with the older the system the more central the data - no extremes.

In the context of humans,when we consider the claimed period of human evolution, it is easy to see how such a preference could emerge 'randomly' and then develop a degree of stability. Furthermore, the preference for this format in information processing gives the organism as rich a degree of choice as is statistically possible and so the optimum analysis of wholes, parts, and their aspects would appear to be based on dichotomous analysis with DNA/RNA coding being an example.
The I Ching, The Template, and The Genetic Code

As mentioned, there have been a number of books that point out the correlation between hexagram creation and the codes for amino acids found in DNA and RNA. What this leads to is a model of thought based on strings of hexagrams, just as a coding sequence for a protein is based on strings of codons (a codon is a 'string' of three molecular bases that, taken as a group, lead to the insertion of a specific amino acid in a protein chain.) Using the DNA/RNA pattern, there is a suggestion that we can produce strings that map to thoughts (the normal process of building a hexagram is based on this, but here we replace yin/yang with a hexagram. Using the normal generation of a hexagram, we find that a hexagram links to a specific codon and so we use hexagrams to map strings of codons.). As the template shows, at any one moment there is a specific state that corelates with(describes) the moment. We determine the state by the degree of dichotomization. Thus, if we only dichotomize to level 2 (4 states) then any moment has one of the possible states as context. Since we wish to avoid generalities, we find that we can start to get good models from level 3 onwards (trigram level) and start to 'loose it', in that we enter the world of complexity and rich individual differences, after level 6 (hexagram level). Using level 3, we find that at a specific moment one of the eight states is active, and it follows that any of the other states can be the next state. This follows for the hexagrams, but at that level we get a more refined state analysis. Therefore the binary I Ching map can be read both vertically and horizontally, futhermore, the left edge wraps around and attaches to the right edge, and the top folds and joins the bottom (this is so because the top is the whole, and the more we cut, the more refined we get until we get to a point where we can cut no more - a continuum which is the whole). All this forms a torus.
DNA/RNA states and specific hexagrams as descriptors

In DNA/RNA systems, a gene string start with the sequence AUG. In the I Ching this links to hexagram 53, Development(Gradual Progress - 'With restraint comes influence'.). A gene ends with one of three possible sequences - UAA (24), UAG (42), or UGA (55). In the current model, these hexagrams deal with:
UAA

24 - Return - A transition point (stimulus). (from yin base to yang base) 'With enlightenment comes trust'.

UAG 42 - Increase - A transition point (stimulus). (change levels - hierarchy) 'With enlightenment comes influence.'

UGA 55 - Abundance - A transition point (response). (overflowing - tension release) 'With guidence comes awareness'

Note that the start hexagram is contractive (yin based) and the end hexagrams are all expansive (yang based). Using the mixing principle, the start is:

53 - contractive binding in the context of contractive bonding. And the ends are: 24 - Contractive blending in the context of expansive binding. 42 - Contractive binding in the context of expansive binding. 55 - Expansive binding in the context of expansive bounding.

In all four hexagrams, binding is predominant, setting the root context for two of the four, with bonding and bounding being the other root contexts. (NOTE: my own mapping of the DNA/RNA codes to the I Ching falls in with that of Johnson Yan. See his "DNA and the I Ching : The Tao of Life" North Atlantic Books (1991) ISBN 155643-097-3.)

If we use the whole/parts dichotomy mappings we have: start:

- (53) aspectual transition/transformation in the context of a part-to-whole relationship. (contractive/contractive)

ends:

(24) wholeness in the context of transition/transformation. (42) transition/transformation in the context of transition/transformation. (55) transition/transformation in the context of parts.

This suggests a possible sequence pattern of endings: 55 <--> 42 <--> 24. To me, there are some 'deep' connatations in this, but then the template can cause that without there being any 'fact'. NOTES: In DNA sequencing, RNApolymerase is required to detect a start position for a specific gene in a DNA sequence. There are two such positions, the -35 sequence and the -10 sequence. It is presumed that the -35 sequence is for the sigma factor of the RNApolymerase to link to and the 10 sequence is the pointer to the start position(+1). Of note is the fact that the amino acids at the -10 sequence (also known as the 'Pribnow Box') are all of the A or T type (A=wholes, P=parts) and the overall pattern (consensus sequence) is deemed TATAAT. The consensus sequence for the -35 sequence is TTGACA (G=dynamic aspects, A = whole). In the gene sequence, the start code is always AUG, a dynamics aspect marker and ends with UAA,UAG,UGA (whole,pAspect, or whole).

Hexagrams

A hexagram is a symbol made-up of six stacked lines. It can also be considered as a symbol made-up of two three-line symbols, called trigrams, one on top of the other. In the I Ching, a line has one of two possible forms, a fixed line linked to the expansive concept of yang, and a 'broken' line linked to the contractive concept of yin. These concepts, yin and yang, form the aspects of a whole, or more specifically, any aspects of the whole that form a pair, or are considered to form a pair; this includes the pairing of whole/aspects. (See sample list of yin/yang pairings) In the traditional I Ching, a hexagram is built by the creation of a line from a 'random' process whilst thinking of a question. Too many, this is a 'synchronistic' process, where synchronicity can be considered as the linking of apparent random events that generates 'meaning'; this linking process happens to be a property of metaphor. A modern-day form would be some of De Bono's 'lateral thinking' concepts. Each line created has four possible states:
A yang line A yin line A yang line changing into a yin line A yin line changing into a yang line

The most common way of creating a hexagram is through the tossing of three coins, the head/tail outcome of which determines the character of a line. Since there are six lines, this is done six times, building the hexagram from the bottom upwards, whilst 'holding' a question in one's mind. The resulting 'meaning' of the hexagram is then considered within the context of the question. When tossing coins (the commonest method) the head/tail results create the lines thus: 3 tails means a changing yang line, symbolized as ----O---3 heads means a changing yin line, symbolized as --- X --2 heads and a tail is a stable yang line, symbolized as --------2 tails and a head is a stable yin lin, symbolized as --- --Usually one would think that yin is even, yang is odd. Yang is the head, yin is the tail. Since yin/yang manifest 2/3 (1 = t'ai chi) so a yang is either 9 (changing) or 7(fixed) and a yin is either 6 (changing) or 8 (fixed). These numeric associations comes from the yarrow stick method of determining a line. BUT then if so, using heads=3, tails=2 an unchanging yang line should = 8 (3+3+2) which is an EVEN number. You need to link tails = 3 and heads = 2 to map the coins to the yarrow stick. 3 heads = 6 (changing yin)

3 tails = 9 (changing yang) 2 heads + a tail = 7 (all yang) 2 tails + a head = 8 (all yin) thus the odd numbers go with yang and the even numbers go with yin. Note however that the intuitive association of heads = yang AND odd, tails = yin AND even is 'screwed' :-). There is no problem with doing the reverse, it just means that the odd/even numbers get mixed up rather than the head/tails getting mixed up. If you keep to numeric terms then a 9 is a changing yang line (Greater Yang). A 7 is a non changing yang line (Lesser Yang) a 6 is a changing yin line (Greater Yin) and an 8 is an unchanging yin line (Lesser Yin). you need to manipulate whatever system you use to ensure these numeric associations. The resulting symbol can look like this:
--- X ------O-------- is changing into ---------------------------------------------------------

The left-hand symbol is the hexagram which is changing into the right-hand symbol. Each of these hexagrams is given a number and linked to some text that describes what the hexagram represents. For the questioner, the above implies a changing process. In this site a slightly different method is used, in that you are asked questions rather than to toss coins or get the computer to generate a random number; we thus combine a causal approach with a synchronous approach. We believe that by doing this one get's a far better understanding of the processes involved, especially the structure of metaphor and how we humans deal with wholes and their aspects. This approach does extend the consultation process, but it leads one into a deeper analysis of a situation and gives better results with which to work. (there is scope to feedin coin toss data if you wish.)
Traditional and Binary Numbering

The origin of the traditional numbering of the hexagrams is unknown and seems to bare no 'logical' ordering (although there may be a semantic influence - see Comments on the Traditional Sequence. We can however derive a number from the line structure of a hexagram. This is done by considering each line position representing a power of 2. A line in a position determines if the

number for that position is used or not. The rule is, for each position filled by a yang (or changing yang) line, we add it's number to any others of the same type (yang lines in the position). Thus the hexagram with all yin lines has a value of 0, whilst the hexagram with all yang lines has a value of 63. The line position numbers are: top - 1 5th - 2 4th - 4 3rd - 8 2nd - 16 bottom - 32 In the hexagram table, these numbers are paired with the 'traditional' numbers. This pairing of numbers is intentional, since most references use the order of the hexagrams according to the traditional method - unfortunate, since the structure of the hexagrams can help lead to a number without having to lookup a trigram table - a common tool in I Ching books. You will find that in this site, I use the traditional numbers to maintain a degree of 'continuity' with the past, but I also use the binary number to get around. At all times assume the traditional number is being used unless told otherwise (like here). (for the binary 'purists' note that the order is top down and thus limited, rather than a more 'logical' bottom-up sequence which would be open-ended). The traditional I Ching gives each trigram a character, and each hexagram can be considered as a description of one character (the top trigram) within the context set by the other (bottom trigram). Through the centuries, the 'meanings' of these relationships have been considered and writtendown. Their 'success' is due to the manner of analysis (dichotomy) being common across all systems with dichotomous roots; the I Ching is a metaphor for wholes and aspects categorization within the process of dichotomous analysis; it thus 'resonates' with any other system based on dichotomous categorization - we 'see' the I Ching in mathematics just as we see mathematics in the I Ching. In fact what we detect is the resonance of the metaphor template; common to both systems, and thus allowing for the ease in making analogies.

SOME NOTES ON THE TRADITIONAL SEQUENCE.

In the 'Ten Wings', a series of ten commentaries on the I Ching and often credited (probably falsly) to the hand of Confusius, there is one wing which writes only about hexagrams 1 and 2 (wing seven "The Commentary on the Words of the Text (Wen Yen)), stating that all the others

are derived from these. The general consensus amongst the various sources is that this is all that remains of the 'full' wing which would comment about the rest of the hexagrams. But maybe this is not the case. Since hexagrams 1 and 2 are the only pure hexagrams, pure yin and pure yang, if we then treat these two as a special case and the rest of the hexagrams as the manifestation of the interaction of yin/yang, then we can group the remaining 62 in order. A result of doing this is that, using the complementary concept, where a hexagram on the left side in some way complements a hexagram on the right side, we find some interesting semantic pairings (I have also included the link to the hexagram details for you to read the meanings linked to the chinese name for a hexagram - these are found in the hexagram page immediately following the hexagram diagram):
Hexagram 01 Giving,Powering Hexagram 03 Difficult Beginnings Hexagram 04 Masking (Socialization) (initial completion) Hexagram 05 Waiting, Serving Hexagram 06 Compromising Hexagram 07 Uniforming Hexagram 08 Uniting (Attracting) Hexagram 09 Small Gaining Bartering) Hexagram 10 Treading (a path) Hexagram 11 Balancing Hexagram 12 Neutralizing Hexagram 13 Grouping Hexagram 14 Directing Hexagram 15 Evening, Levelling Hexagram 57 Cultivating Hexagram 56 Restrained Journeying Hexagram 55 Overflowing Hexagram 54 Wasting,Immaturing Hexagram 53 Maturing Hexagram 52 Self Restraint Hexagram 02 Receiving Hexagram 64 Difficult Endings Hexagram 63 'Correct' Sequencing (final completion) Hexagram 62 Portraying,Acting,Pretend (serve tradition) Hexagram 61 Sympathizing Hexagram 60 Standardising Hexagram 59 Dispelling (Making things clear) Hexagram 58 Self Reflecting (Intenseness - also

The point I am making is that the 'traditional' hexagram sequence may have started off as a map of similar influences on hexagrams with similar meanings and structures (e.g. 64 is the reverse of 03 with a line added, and both deal with difficulties. 63 is the reverse of 04 with a line added, and both deal with transformation; 04 at the start where one learns a social 'mask', 63 at the end where a process of transformation occurs; mask and body become one.) If we put the list in a numeric sequence from yang to yin, then the only number out of sequence is pure yin (02). The most likely dichotomy here seems to emphasize begin/expand (yang) with end/contract (yin). Thus many of the pairings can be read as "you begin with X (left side hex) and you end with Y (right side hex)". Another point is that the current sequence seems to reflect refinement where the first 'book' starts with the pure trigrams of yin and yang doubled as hexagrams of 1 and 2, and ends with the hexagrams 29 and 30; what may be called the pure mixed trigrams doubled; the former symbolize earth and heaven (air) and the latter fire and water. The second book begins with the social concepts (and therefore refined over the pure but raw yin/yang) of wooing and marriage (31,32) and end with the transformation hexagrams of 63 and 64. Of note is the fact that the books are imbalanced as far as hexagrams are concerned, 30 in book I and 34 in book II. This format is associated with two of the ten wings. These wings, 1 and 2 are combined and called the "Commentry on the Judegement" (T'uan Chuan). As we see in the link "The Qabalah and the I Ching" the format is not restricted to China and there is the suggestion that there is a relationship between the two systems in that either the I Ching and the Qabalah have a common source, or, they symbolize the concept of refinement so well that they seem to be tied but infact have evolved seperately. From this author's point of view, both the I Ching and the Qabalah as well as the Tarot and Astrology are manifestations of typologies created by humans and these typologies reflect an underlying template within the mind of humans. The fact that a copy of the I Ching dating back to 168 BC was dug up in 1973 and found to have a different order to the 'traditional' sequence suggests that the traditional sequence is of later development and so the above comments about refinement suggest a possible tie-in with alchemy and Taoism, which puts a development path for the 'traditional' order ranging from 168 BC to 1100 AD. As far as the ten wings are concerned they seemed to have been developed between 600 BC and 100 AD and it is in one of these that we find the Fu Hsi and King Wen arrangements. However, there is evidence to suggest that the world of thought arrangement did not exist until the Sung Dynasty when it was either discovered or created by one Ch'en T'uan (c906-989CE). This has ramifications as to the true content of the Shuo Kua wing prior to this time. (See "The Trigrams of Han" by S. Moore for details). With regard to the refinement concepts, however, the traditional format of the I Ching together with the Fu Hsi sequence and the King Wen sequence combined with actual hexagram interpretations strongly suggest a modelling of paths of refinement and that this system existed

PRIOR to the development of Confuscianism and Taoism (500BC). Since texts from 600 BC exist refering to the I Ching, and the Duke of Chou, the originator of the line comments, existed circa 1000 BC, the I Ching as we know it was probably in a usable form around 800BC.
The Binary format and predictability.

I have shown in the first part of this link the emergent character of a binary tree resulting from the simple application of a dichotomy. This suggests that, for each step that is predictable, a specific state is mapped. Experience over time would enable the development of a system of prediction as well as a system of analysis of the past. If we treat the individual as having a future time cone and a past time cone, then the binary tree extends from the individual both forwards and backwards:
\------------/ \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \/ (ME) /\ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /------------\

Future

Past

Using the yin/yang symbols, we develop a tree system forwards and have a tree behind. The tree behind is analysed top-down, and the tree forward is created bottom-up. The number of levels that we decide to use is immaterial, although the I Ching system suggests that six is deep enough. At any moment in time we are at the end of, at the beginning of, and in the middle of a hexagram. The determination of current position is based on past contexts, and tried-and-true paths can strongly influence descision making. Furthermore, this is not a serial system, we can have many trees operating at the same time within different timeframes. The 'meanings' of this information can be strongly subjective but there is also a level objectivity in that common psychological states can be mapped to a system that is applied sociologically. In the creation of typologies, an initial observation, in the form of a dichotomy, can be written down and, as such, becomes timeless (all x are y or z). This form can now be used as feedback for the creation of another dichotomy based on a finer level of observation (all x are a or b). By this process we build a typology, the whole of which is now applied at one timeframe (you are this type) even though it needed a number of timeframes to develop. This shows the oscillation between temporal and non-temporal states within development, and the feedingback of data to help create more data. The temporal componant is the derivation of the single dichotomy which upon expression is added to the developing hierarchy that becomes the 'whole' typology.

What determines the 'completeness' of a typology is, I suggest, it's usefulness. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is founded on four dichotomies and is useful for determining the sociological aspects of behaviour. Fewer dichotomies make it too general and increased dichotomies make it too specific, and therefore too personal; there is a 'window' where the system works when applied to individuals within a group. As far as the I Ching is concerned, it's level of completeness is set at sixty-four hexagrams. What is of interest is that, when we compare the I Ching and the MBTI�, as we can do since they are based on dichotomies and can be layed-out on a binary tree, we find that the words used to describe specific states share common themes within identical positions. What this implies is that the binary tree manifests a form of template that has PRECISE meanings for all positions, irrespective of actual content. This is an emergent property and it's presence only becomes obvious after analysis, it is not a 'known' level of consciousness; the tree more of a template. The question considered here is what is the path from a hexagram to any other hexagram other than that hexagram's opposite; e.g. what is the path from any hexagram into 56? For discovering contextual hexagrams, when we change lines in a hexagram we then swap the resulting trigrams to get the contextual hexagram linked to influencing the specific line changes. If hexagram 01 is changing into hexagram 02, then all lines are changing and swapping the trigrams still gives hex 02; this becomes the contextual influence. From our descriptive chart, and using 02 as the key, we find that 23 describes the flow from 01 to 02. However, if hexagram 01 is changing into hexagram 56 the we have to change lines 1,2, and 5 of hex 01. Swapping the trigrams we get hexagram 22 as the hexagram of contextual influence, 22 influencing 01 leads to 56. From the descriptive chart, using 22 as the key, we find that 62 describes the flow of 47 into 22. What this implies is that the path leading into 56 is the same path that leads from 47 to 22. But the proposed path from 60 to 56 (working on opposites) is described by 36. What we see here is at least two paths into one hexagram.
60-->56 = 36 01-->56 = 22

Of note here is that the two resulting hexagrams both symbolize forms of covering-up. However, I am not satisfied that this is valid; there are many variations on the path of making a cake but there is a 'base' path - parts that are invarient. In this, the contextual concept seems to work well but the descriptive concept, as it stands, has limits. Therefore, I have done a step by step analysis which seems to make better 'sense'.

For any hexagram, the description of the path leading into it is obtained by (1) determining the contextual hexagram for the whole hexagram. (2) use the descriptive table previously derived to find the descriptive hexagram. In this we find that the path from 01 to 02 is described by hexagram 23 (as previous) but unique paths emerge for the other transformations. As an example I here use the transformation process of hexagram 01 into any other hexagram:
Key: Ctx = context hexagram influencing the line changes. Des = hexagram that best describes the transformation process. -> = ..transforming into..

The influencing hexagram (Ctx) nudges the influenced hexagram (A) into a specific state (B) and this transformation has a specific format described by (Des). What this implies is that the influenced hexagram (A) is *any* hexagram whereas the resulting hexagram (B) has fixed Ctx and Des formats. Simply put, *any* hexagram changing into, for example, hexagram 50 is being influenced by 37 and the process of transformation is described by 32. The differences are the number of changing lines imposed on the influenced hexagram (A). Using this we find that the sets of hexagrams previously discussed (A-H) change slightly as far as descriptions are concerned (although the members of sets A and H remain the same). This system states that the path into a hexagram is fixed and has a specific format. This is 'logical' in that to get to a specific house you follow a specific route. But the initial start position is 'global' (anywhere) and thus the 'specific route' is local and fixed to the destination (like the path upto the door of the house) Furthermore, to get onto the path requires a specific influence irrespective of the current situation. To go to jail, for example, requires the breaking of a law. Thus a specific context can influence a situation to a degree that it changes into another situation and there is a specific process involved in the transformation. So, not only is the transformation of 01 into 02 described by hexagram 23, but so is any transformation into 02 (the influence is also 02). Thus, the transformation of any hexagram into 05 is influenced by 06 (seek compromise) and described by 09 - making small gains.

It's complement is the transformation into 35. Here the influence is 36 (no compromise) and described by 16 - making plans (forsight). Any transformation into 47, enforced waiting, is based on an influence of limitation (60) and is described as compromising (06). (control the 'light'). whereas any transformation into 22, fascading, is based on an influence of 'conforming' (56) and is described as uncompromising (36) (covering the light).
Conclusion.

What we see here is a refinement of the descriptive hexagrams in the context of transformations. The original contextual material remains valid and is used to derive the descriptive hexagram but there are still 'loose ends', possibly resulting from the context-dependent nature of the I Ching allowing for subtle variations on a theme. It seems as if the previous descriptive format is infact one of form rather than process, 01 encapsulates the 'whole' of the 15-to-10 relationship rather than describes the process between them. This is done through hexagram 58 within the influence of 43. (going from 15 to 10 is symbolic of increasing intensity and self-reflection resulting from a pressure to break out. But this would be the same description for 01, or any other hexagram, going to 10.) As far as 'encapsulation' is concerned, the emphasis on 01 being too yang (gross context of 28) as well as inspiriational (immediate context of 34) is governed by the traditional texts expressing a need for the maintenance of balance at all times; both traits of 15 and 10. (and note that this point is also emphasised in 02 - too little yang/too much yin). An example of a 'questionable' descriptor from the previous work is that of 04 describing the 'flow' from 14 to 08. This is weak, but what is not weak is the 'attractor' nature of 14 (active) and 08 (passive) and the encapsulating of this by the 04/49 pair. (04 says 'approach a teacher' passive attractor whereas 49 has a somewhat more active approach). Using 08/14 as reference, in the above 'improvements', any hex changing into 08 is influenced by 07 and the transformation is described by 20. Any hexagram changing into 14 is influenced by 13 and the transformation is described by 34. Note that the 04/49 influences still linger in the form of changing into 07 is influenced by 08 and described by 04 (uniforming is influenced by a sense of attraction and involves 'masking'). And changing into 13 is influenced by 14 and described by 49. It is interesting to note that there is a degree of slipping and sliding involved in all of this but I dont think it is all 'me'. The patterns that emerge are often stunning in their clarity but there still seems to be a bit of mist (fog!?) around.

The I Ching, Context, and Reality (Copyright � 1996 C.J.Lofting)
Wholes & parts.

There seems to be a tendancy to treat the universe as if it is all yin or yang. What is important to recognize when dealing with any dichotomy is that an element of the dichotomy is only 'meaningful' when considered in the context of the other element. This derives from the creation of the dichotomy, which is done when we analize a whole; we break the whole down and thus form a set of dichotomies:
whole/aspects whole/parts parts/aspects etc.,

Thus, in the domain of yin/yang, which only exists when we cut a whole since the union of yin and yang leads back to the whole and thus yin and yang 'dissapear', no matter what is studied, any aspect manifesting a yin bias MUST have a yang element as context and visa versa to be considered as a whole. To exclude one element is akin to trying to get a complete understanding of a fish without considering it in it's natural habitat, water. When we consider the hexagrams of the I Ching in their structural form, each hexagram has it's structural opposite, and the union of these two hexagrams creates a wholistic concept; the hexagrams opperate as opposite sides of the same coin, so to get an idea of the whole we need simply to name the coin. This is structural context and deals with the hexagrams as having either yin or yang biases. It is akin to cutting a fish down the middle and comparing the halves without considering any developmental aspects. With yin and yang, the idea is to get them to re-unite and become whole, and this is also in the process of refinement where yin/yang form the raw materials. This process of refinement forms the foundations of alchemy. In it's modern form, we find this transformation process in the forming of a new metal alloy. If I take two raw materials (call them yin and yang) and then mix them and heat them, only after a specific time at a specific temperature does the new alloy form. If I stop the process, or let it go on too long, or use the wrong temperature, I get nothing but hot raw materials or I get a lump of 'something' which I can do nothing with other than melt it down and try and do it all again. What emerges from this is the affects of surroundings on development.

When we analize a hexagram as a whole, using the concept of refinement, we introduce a degree of bias which is not present when we consider structure. In refinement we introduce a developmental bias, either line by line or trigram over trigram. The development of hexagram 01, for example, implies that it did not suddenly 'appear' but that it developed from a gross state to the refined state; this is analogous to studying the fertilization of a fish egg and the emergence and development of the fish within it's natural context. The only form of dichotomy that deals with whole/aspects relationships is the one:many type which is different to the one:one type which is the type usually considered in dichotomous analysis. The process of refinement introduces the concept of hierarchy and thus 'the many'. Therefore, the refined meaning inherant in hexagram 01 is considered to have emerged from less refined sources. But, the meaning of hexagram 01 can be treated in a gross or refined way, implying that it can be used as the finished product or as the context for something else. In the I Ching, this seems to be the case for all of the hexagrams. Semantic analysis leads to the emergence of contextual hexagrams, but formal structural modifications (e.g. changing lines 1 & 6 to get the initial contextual hexagram) link text and context hexagram suggesting structural-semantic dependance. All other contexts that emerge in the process of developing hexagram 01 must function within the initial gross context. The difference when compared to the structural context concept (structural opposites) is that the refinement gives us more information about the development of a specific hexagram; we are at a deeper level of analysis. This link retains the yin/yang nature of wholeness in that one element must have the context of the other element, but also introduces developmental aspects not previously considered in the 'Western' analysis of the I Ching, although it is loosly covered in the analysis of the context of lines where the line characteristics similar to hexagram 63 are used as line contexts for all of the hexagrams. The demonstration of the existance of contextual hexagrams other than the opposite structure type, only emerges through dynamic structural analysis followed by semantic analysis, and it opens-up the I Ching in ways not considered before. This also shows the principle of dichotomy at work, for all of the processes found in the mixing of yin/yang are processes inherant in any use of dichotomous analysis. The success of the I Ching, and many other systems of predictiom based on dichotomy, is that they all function within the context of the prime dichotomy of prediction - me/universe. This is often treated in a one:one manner although it is in fact a one:many type of dichotomy. If the process of dichotomous analysis is a natural tool of the brain, if it has neurological roots, then any 'map' of reality will infact resonate with one's mind irrespective of 'truth'; no matter what pattern emerges we will find some 'value', some how.

The question therefore arises as to the 'value' of using the I Ching as a tool of prediction rather than simply as a guide to the different forms possible when using dichotomous analysis. The answer to this is that, since the I Ching can be considered as a map of dichotomous analysis, and since this form of analysis is continuously used in the everyday world, analogies can easily be found. However, to use the I Ching in a passive manner, by throwing coins or using random number generators to emulate the yarrow stick method, is to cheapen it - especially if that is all we do. We can suggest that the act of throwing coins is part of the way of the inferior; creative but, in the long term, sterile. Only by activly using the I Ching, by knowing all of the possible manifestations and putting oneself under the influence of one or the other can 'true' progress be made and we follow the way of the superior; this way includes the tossing of coins but as an innovative aspect of the whole process rather than the 'only' method of using the I Ching.
(Note that "the way of the inferior" does NOT mean an inferior person. It means an inferior method.)

Thus, the placing of text within context becomes an active methodology based on the explicit nature of the I Ching and thus enables a more refined understanding of one's 'true' position; the determination of the context of one's own situation is easy and far more effective than throwing coins and leaving it all to chance (The possible results of which, for those who want to do it 'properly', can be found in the novel "The Dice Man"). The I Ching can work as an excellent guide to the possibilities that emerge from the mixing of yin and yang, but to consider the I Ching solely in the light of an active response to a passive enquiry will lead to confusion and frustration. In the context of the individual, the I Ching is more like an idiot savant and serves the same function as does mathematics in that it contains the works of many and thus serves as a source of information within a specific context, and the use of this information is upto the individual. In the social context, the I Ching can be used to determine social evolution in that once a path has begun it is often hard to leave unless a lot of energy is put-in to change direction. Thus, the determination of social context and the resulting text can display a path of development. It is then upto the individual to decide whether he/she wishes to be under the influence of this path or whether he/she wishes to find a different influence. At all times there are specific social situations occuring that the I Ching can 'map'. This is purely from the use of dichotomy. Free will is the ability to activly place oneself outside or inside of one of these situations and thus be influenced and/or influence the situation. In consistantly following the throwing of coins etc., is to stick to the way of the inferior, and is akin to saying 'I have attempted to understand my world and I have totally failed - you decide for me'. To follow this path is acceptable, but to then refuse or ignore the result is an act of betrayal; one enquires and then says "no no no, I know better than you, you are wrong". This act is 'out of context'; the moment one picks-up the coins to toss them, one has surrendered all claims to selfdetermination, and to then attempt to move the goal posts implies a degree of self-betrayal of the

worst kind. In this method, the resulting hexagram is taken literally - as a real influence on the situation, and to apply analysis to the method is invalid - you do not question, you just accept. The act of using the I Ching as a map and thus guide is the way of the superior, it says "I decide on my future, but since possibly all of the combinations of the future are shown within the I Ching (due to dichotomy) I will actively use it as a guide rather than wandering around rewriting the I Ching in the process." To then emphasize coins and yarrow sticks and the concept of synchronicity is a betrayal since this act is 'out of context'. The way of the superior is one of active (dynamic) structural and semantic analysis of the elements of the I Ching and the placing of oneself in the appropriate situation that one could participate in and thus satisfy one's desires. At first, this can be a highly energy-intensive exercise. But as one starts to learn the affects of context on the emergence of situations and the reluctance of many to put-in energy to change a path once it is underway, so one learns to pre-empt, and thus choices of action become easier. In this context, the use of random methods to generate a hexagram is acceptable when seen in the light of it's purpose - to play with text and context and possibly ellicit a difference, innovative perspective. This is a property of metaphor rather than some 'synchronistic' moment; the result is taken as metaphor, and thus open to aspectual analysis as one endevours to capture all of the nuances hidden in the metaphor. 'Reality', the whole, is the unification of these two extremes; and thus the realization that perhaps, when one side starts to serve you badly, it is time to go to the other side. This introduces a degree of oscillation which allows for observation of the emergence of invariant componants of the two extremes. These componants, since they are common, imply that they manifest a part of 'reality' rather than attributes of the extremes.
The emergence of meaning.

The previous emphasis on the dichotomy of inferior/superior within the context of the I Ching, introduces the concept of meaning; how is it that following the path of the inferior I can get just as much 'meaning' out of the I Ching as if I followed the path of the superior? We can extend this by asking, how is that, despite the advances of science, a vast number of people on this planet favour the use of esoteric forms of knowledge (I Ching, Astrology, Tarot, etc.,) over scientifically derived forms? The answer has to be that these esoteric forms ellicit 'meaningful responses' that are equivalent to those derivable from science. How could this be? The answer seems to be the use of the principle of dichotomy to categorize.

Kin Wen's World of Senses

One of the most 'obscure' parts of the commentries in the I Ching is the part that describes the nature of the World of Senses diagram. (In the Shuo Kua Chuan - Discussion of the trigrams) "God comes forth [with his creation] in the sign of the Arousing; he brings things to completion in the sign of the Gentle; he causes creatures to perceive one another in the sign of the Clinging; he causes them to serve one another in the sign of the Receptive. He gives them joy in the sign of the Joyous; he battles in the sign of the Creative; he toils in the sign of the Abysmal; he brings them to perfection in the sign of Keeping Still" Wilhelm/Baynes p268 Wilhelm suggests that this passage is extremely old, to the extent that the passage following in the text is an addition from Confusist sources to detail what the above is all about. However, if we consider the derivation of the I Ching in binary format (Structural bias) a pattern emerges that correlates with the characteristics of the above passage when we overlay the MyersBriggs Type Indicator®, a personality typology based on the work of Carl Jung. The method I use makes the following MBTI/Keirsey associations with the I Ching trigrams:
--------------------------------------------------------------------The Arousing - Engineers (XNTP), i.e. architects, philosophers, inventors designers. In other texts there is the suggestion that the term 'God' in Wilhelm's text should be replaced by the generic term 'he' and also that the term [with his creation] should be included in the translation. Doing this creates a correlation between The Arousing and XNTPs "[he] comes forth [with his creation] in the sign of the Arousing." ------------------------------------------------------------------The Gentle - Monitors (XSTJ) i.e. trustees, inspectors, administrators, supervisors. The management crowd. Those who direct/control tasks to their completion "he brings things to completion in the sign of the Gentle" -----------------------------------------------------------------------The Clinging - Organizers (XNTJ) i.e. Scientists, planners, theorticians, Commanders, Strategists. The map-makers and organizers of the culture. "he causes creatures to perceive one another in the sign of the Clinging" ------------------------------------------------------------------------The Receptive - Advocates/Disciples (XNFP) i.e. seekers, questors, revealers, enthusiasts, journalists. "he causes them to serve one another in the sign of the Receptive" ------------------------------------------------------------------------The Joyous - Players (XSFP) i.e. artist, composer, appreciator, entertainer, performer.

"he gives them joy in the sign of the Joyous" ------------------------------------------------------------------------The Creative - Operators (XSTP) i.e. Artisans, Crafter, Promoter, Trouble-shooter, Negotiator "he battles in the sign of the Creative" ---------------------------------------------------------------------The Abysmal - Conservators (XSFJ) i.e. Preserver, conservator, protector provider, salesperson. "he toils in the sign of the Abysmal" ------------------------------------------------------------------------Keeping Still - Mentors (XNFJ) i.e. seers, authors, prophets, ringmasters pedagogues. "he brings them to perfection in the sign of Keeping Still" --------------------------------------------------------------------------In this context the 'signs' relate to the binary sequence and should not be confused with the 'traditional' houses of the I Ching.

Sociological Development

If we look at the world of senses order, we can read it as a sociological development path:
Arousing | V Gentle | V Clinging | V Receptive | V Joyous | V Creative | V Abysmal | V Keeping Still ('death') --> enlightenment and thus awareness ('birth') --> cultivation and thus influence --> guidence and thus direction --> devotion and thus trust --> reflection and thus intensity --> perseverence and thus confidence --> containment and thus control --> self-restraint and thus retainment/discernment (perfection)

Multiple changing line combinations in hexagrams.

The model of the I Ching proposed to date deals with the fixed text and context for each hexagram position. The use of the randomisation process enables one to discover a finer level of refinement, namely the 4096 possible states in which text can exist in any of the other contexts. (64 * 64 = 4096). This works on the principle outlined in the discussion on context that since the hexagrams are supposed to encapsulate all that there is, then line changes are caused by the influences of other hexagrams being placed as context, for it is a change in context that can ellicit a change in the text. The intention is for the user to consider the text/context dichotomy applied to the hexagrams of the I Ching. For example, a 'pure' hexagram 01 exists only in it's own context, but the root of 01 has a different context, namely that symbolised by hexagram 28 - exceeding. (excessive yang). So as we work our way through a hexagram, we are in fact working our way through contextual changes with the text held constant. With 28 as introduced context it affects the line 1 position which in turn introduces hexagram 09 as the contextual line change influence and the system then transforms in hexagram 44. What this introduces is the specific paths into and out of hexagrams through the process of changing contexts; for it is contextual change that forces text to adapt and also change - just as with one's own persona, change your immediate environment and 'you' change to deal with it. Another, and 'deeper', example would be how to get hexagram 01 to change into hexagram 33. This requires the transformation of the bottom two lines and the context position list given at the end of this page gives hexagram 31 as the influence. Thus, by introducing a context of 31, it influences the 1 & 2 line positions of hexagram 01 and that leads to the line change influence of 26 that gives us hexagram 33. (If the middle step seems complicated you can ignore considering it - just note that a context of 31 leads to a change of the text, anytext, to 33). The hexagram questions at this site enable the generation of a hexagram that 'describes' a particular situation. To change specific lines in the hexagram to something else requires a change of the current context and this is delt with by introducing a context that will influence one or more lines to change. There are 64 possible combinations for any one hexagram, giving 4096 possible states in total. There is a price for this, however, for the lines to be changed require energy to do so. The hardest line to change is the bottom line and the easiest the top line. Multiple line changes increase the amount of energy required, unless they are in the process of change already. For each hexagram 'required' there is a hexagram that works as context to change the lines of the current hexagram to those of the 'required' hexagram. This contextual hexagram encapsulates a process, namely the interaction of one hexagram's transformation into it's opposite. In the context of, say, hexagram 31, the influence is to change the bottom two lines of hexagram 01 giving hexagram 33. This change is driven by one of the hexagrams that 31 encapsulates - namely hexagram 26.

At the line change level we are dealing with the 45/26 pair and 26 - holding firm - implies a change and a favouring of values as well as a time factor of what will be. 31 encapsulates the meaning for this pair which is a gross state of joining (or re-joining) together) Consider: this 31 HSIEN : Contact, influence, move; excite, mobilize, trigger; all, totally, universal, continual, entire; unite, bring together the parts of a previously separated whole; come into conjunction, as the planets; literally: A broken piece of pottery, the two halfs of which we used to identify partners." p102 (KARCHER 1995)

encapsulates the overall generic meaning behind these two going from 45 to 26 (41 concentrating - does the reverse in hex 02) "45 T'SUI : Gather, call or pack together; tight groups of people, animals and things; assemble, concentrate, collect; reunite, reassemble; crowd, multitude, bunch; dense clumps of grass. The ideogram portrays a bunch of grass and a servant. It suggests gathering the capacity to do things" p136 (KARCHER 1995) "26 TA CH'U : TA - Big, noble, important; able to protect others; orient your will towards a self-imposed goal; the ability to lead or guide your life; yang energy. CH'U - Gather, collect, take in, hoard, retain; control, restrain; take care of, support, tolerate; tame, train or pasture animals; raise, bring up, domesticate; be tamed or controlled by something. The ideogram portrays fertile black soil accumulated by retaining silt." p90 (KARCHER 1995)

This overall context is behind the change from 01 into 33 Retreat, the hexagram we get when we change the bottom two lines of 01:
"33 TUN: Withdraw, run away, escape, flee, hide yourself; disappear, withdraw into obscurity, become invisible; secluded, anti-social; fool or trick someone. The ideogram portrays a pig (the sign of wealth and good fortune) and the sign for walk away. It suggests satisfaction, luck and wealth through withdrawing." p107 (KARCHER 1995)

The emphasis on group ('whole') formation/re-formation runs through all of these hexagrams. Hex 33 is more often concidered symbolising a structured withdrawl of forces to fight another day; uniting the emphasis on withdrawl with that of trickary. The question is now raised as to how do I stop a system from changing? The answer is to introduce the opposite context to the change. In the discussion so far we have been concerned with changing 01 into 33 by introducing an overall context of 31 that 'lets loose' 26 that makes the changes to lines 1 & 2 of hexagram 01. If you describe a system that is already in the process of change (line 1 & 2 are changing lines) then to abort the change introduce the context of 31's opposite - 41, this will 'let loose' 45 to neutralise the influence of 26. BUT, this could lead to the emergence of 19, the opposite of 33, if allowed to go too far. As you can see, it is all a matter of maintaining balance. Once balance is maintained, use a context of hexagram 43 that should make the system stable leading to a 'clean' 01.

This system gives a hierarchic format (and there are 4096 of these):
01 (text) 31 (context for combination of positions 1&2) / \ 45 26 (line no-change/change influences) / \ 19 33 (change) (by implication)

What this means is that, in a situation of pure yang, as symbolised by hexagram 01, to get it to change to 33 requires the change of context from 01 to 31; this contextual change forces the transformation of 01 (text) into 33 by influencing the bottom two lines of 01. It should be noted that this is not an easy task since other forces will also be trying to change (or maintain) the current situation to a state of their liking, and the more the number of lines to change the more energy required (unless some are already changing which means they just need a 'push'). Due to the potentially large size of this section, the process is applied only to hexagram 01, thus showing the many possibilities for the reader to study. In the context list below it is only the line positions that change for each hexagram (under the 'Change Positions' column) - the other data is constant. (e.g. to change *anything* into 01, introduce a context of 43 - to get the hang of things, try just working on one line). For interest here are the possible single position associations for a hexagram as used in the traditional I Ching:
(6) Sage , Refined, Ending (5) Ruler (4) Minister ----(INNER/OUTER TRANSITION POINT)--(3) Noble (2) Supervisor (1) Worker, Raw, Beginning

In summary, what should be noted is that here you have all of the 64 possible states of the hexagram 01 - as it appears in all of the possible contexts. The traditional line commentries are restricted to 6 lines; there should in fact be 64 commentaries per hexagram! The best way of getting a 'feel' for the missing material is to imagine the context hexagram here listed and then the text hexagram (01) 'within' that context; you combine text and context to give possibly 'enhanced' meaning. For example, the overall influence on the line 1 position, irrespective of change or no change, is the root context of hexagram 28 - excess. 01 in this context helps to express the raw

excessiveness of yang, to the extent that we change into an 'excessive' hexagram, 44, that deals with extremes of persuasion/seduction. As we move through all of the possiblities so we find we are part of a cycle, moving from the gross nature of the hexagram to it's peak and then transforming into it's opposite; encaspsulated here by 01 being in the context set by hexagram 23 - cutting-back/pruning - that transforms 01 into 02. For those interested in a a finer level of analysis we have, for example, the pair 16/09 that affect the non-change/change status of line 1 rather than the position. From this model we see that the positional context hexagram serves as a static aspect of the whole - it is invarient over change - whilst the line hexagram pairs are more related to dynamic aspects - so we move from the whole (01) and into analysis of it's static and dynamic aspects.
NOTE

If the below seems complex, just note the 'Position context' and 'Result' columns. These say that to change any hexagram into the hexagram whose number appears in the Result column, just change the context to a context symbolised by the hexagram number in the 'Position Context' column. This may seem 'easy' but it is not, since for each hexagram, the number of lines requiring change can be excessive and thus require a lot of energy - be warned :-)

The following lists various texts that have contributed to my analysis of the I Ching as well as my concept of brain structure and it's manifestation in 'meaningful' literature. Most of the I Ching texts are translations of translations with the exception of those marked with an * at the beginning of the line. (for listings of neurological interest, see the reference list at the end of the "brain" link found at the beginning of the first page) The mixing template and definitions that I have used are 'mine'. You will not find them explicitly in any of the texts but you will find clues to their existance. (Qualification: Of all the texts that I have read I have not found the grouping definitions. There maybe some chinese texts that contain them or perhaps they were all burnt in the burnings of 200 BC). A 'fuller' analysis of the template is in the dichotomy links as well as in my text - "The Sense of Dichotomy" (email).

It basically introduces the Spacetime Continuum Mind concept and then applies the concept to various areas of study. I suppose the 13 'books' are the explicit manifestation of the implicit concept).

Overview

Below are all sixty-four line changes for this hexagram. This is possible since this site, having analysed the I Ching in detail, works on the following axioms:

(1) The I Ching symbolises all there is. (2) Given (1) so all changes to the lines of a hexagram are caused by the influence of another hexagram that serves as context. (3) The distinction of text from context, at the trigram level as well as the hexagram level, enables a richer understanding of this oracle, and includes recognition of the concept of refinement where the same hexagram/trigam can have qualitative differences depending on position. For example, the trigram called heaven, when in a context position emphasises perseverence whereas when in a text position so this is 'doubled' and reflects a refinement of perserverence in the form of self-confidence and singlemindedness. In the following sections we analyse the result of taking the major hexagram, here being hexagram 01 and capturing the essence of singlemindedness, and seeing the result of it being influenced by a particular context, where that context causes the line changes. This process not only shows where things are going but what is influencing the situation. This information enables (a) a better understanding of what is going on, as well as (b) a possible path to 'block' the change. The user has the choice of either letting things change or else fighting the change; to fight the change means to introduce a context in opposition to the one currently acting as influence; the required context is mentioned in each section. It is important to remember that ANY change is seen as a distraction from following the path of the 'pure' hexagram. There will be conditions where the change seems attractive and so preferred but this will take you 'off' the path in that to experience the totality of any path so you need to experience the lows as well as the highs...the choice is yours...
Changing Lines

Line 1 "Although having potential, one must must lie low (hidden) for now." Singlemindedness, combined with a context of developing influence through making small gains (hexagram 9) leads to the behaviour of being seductively persuasive and influencial (hexagram 44).

To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to be discerning and seperate the wheat from the chaff; prune (hexagram 23). Line 4 "If one enjoys oneself in a seductive environment, no harm." Singlemindedness, combined with a context of seductive persuasion and influence (hexagram 44), leads to the behaviour of developing influence through making small gains (hexagram 9). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to avoid these distractions and return to the 'true' path (hexagram 24). Line 5 "One may be riding high but one needs some guidance[direction]." Singlemindedness, combined with a context of making partnerships with the like-minded (hexagram 13), leads to the behaviour of becoming the center of proactive directing and advancement (hexagram 14).

Line 6 "One has become somewhat overbearing and is losing one's way. Repent." Singlemindedness, combined with a context of intensely following a path (hexagram 10), leads to the behaviour of being resolute and strongly 'spreading the word' (hexagram 43). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to level-out, reduce the highs and lows through developing a sense of modesty (hexagram 15). Lines 1 & 2 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of holding firm (hexagram 26), leads to the behaviour of using trickary and 'false' retreats (hexagram 33).

Lines 1 & 3 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of calculated waiting (hexagram 5), leads to the behaviour of making compromises (hexagram 6). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to ensure continued progress (hexagram 35). Lines 1 & 4

Singlemindedness, combined with a context of cultivation (hexagram 57), leads to the behaviour of influencing (hexagram 57). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need only to be aware (hexagram 51) of things around you and so avoid entanglement. Lines 1 & 5 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of everything having its place (hexagram 37), leads to the behaviour of completing transformations (hexagram 50). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to relax and so maintain some flexibility (hexagram 40). Lines 1 & 6 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of sofening (hexagram 61), leads to the behaviour of going beyond what is required, exageration, excess (hexagram 28). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to over-declare the 'true' way (hexagram 62). Lines 2 & 3 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of motivating (hexagram 34), leads to the behaviour of disentanglement and asserting one's position regardless of consequence (hexagram 25). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to be admired by setting an example (hexagram 20). Lines 2 & 4 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of completing transformation (hexagram 50), leads to the behaviour of putting things in their correct place (hexagram 37). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to go back, or stay, to the beginning of transformation (hexagram 3) Lines 2 & 5 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of guiding (hexagram 30), leads to the behaviour of establishing a particular direction (hexagram 30). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to maintain containment/control (hexagram 29) rather than surrender to guidance. Lines 2 & 6 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of opposition (hexagram 38), leads to the behaviour of unmasking; revolution (hexagram 49). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to bypass obstructions (hexagram 39) rather than oppose them.

Lines 3 & 4 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of excess (going beyond what is required) (hexagram 28), leads to the behaviour of yielding (softening of the heart) (hexagram 61) and of singlemindedly going to 'bat' against a perceived injustice. To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to continue to hunger for knowledge (hexagram 27) and so maintain a degree of emptyness. Lines 3 & 5 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of revolution (hexagram 49), leads to a behaviour of unmasking; opposition (hexagram 38). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to mask (hexagram 4) rather than unmask. Lines 3 & 6 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of self-reflection (hexagram 58), leads to the behaviour intenseness (hexagram 58). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to apply self-restraint; discernment (hexagram 52) and so avoid excessive self-reflection. Lines 4 & 5 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of constructed retreat (trickery) (hexagram 33), leads to the behaviour of holding firm (to one's beliefs) (hexagram 26). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to advance (hexagram 19). Lines 4 & 6 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of compromising (hexagram 6), leads to the behaviour of calculated waiting (hexagram 5).

Lines 5 & 6 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of disentanglement (a hexagram 25), leads to the behaviour of motivating (hexagram 34). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to push on, maintaining entanglement (hexagram 46). Lines 1 & 2 & 3 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of harmonising (hexagram 11), leads to the behaviour of neutralising (hexagram 12). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to maintain neutrality (hexagram 12) in the face of harmonising since to go down this path the best you can do is neutralise. Lines 1 & 2 & 4

Singlemindedness, combined with a context of correcting (hexagram 18), leads to the behaviour of maturing (gradual progress) (hexagram 53). To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to emphasise belief (hexagram 17) rather than try to 'correct' things. Lines 1 & 2 & 5 Singlemindedness, combined with a context of facading (hexagram 22), leads to the behaviour of maintaining loyalty (hexagram 56 - a form of limitation). Hexagram 56 tradtionally is known as "The Wanderer" and deals with travelling in other lands and still maintaining home ties. This process involves putting on 'faces' but still keeping one's 'true' identity. To stay on the path of singlemindedness you need to force your roots grow deep (hexagram 47) and so maintain a firm grip rather than use facades.
