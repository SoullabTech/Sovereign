which we inherit genetically. It contains general
ideas, themes, or motifs which are passed along
from one generation to another and are retained
        as part of our human inheritance.

which have the characteristics of language.
      Historical-critical Theory


There are a multitude of factors which influence
the origin and development of myths and that no
         single explanation will suffice.
