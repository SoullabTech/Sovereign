✅ **Interactive Holoflower Check-In is LIVE!**

  

  **What's Been Built**

  

  1. **Complete User Flow**

  

  /welcome-back (greeting)

    Two buttons:

    - "Check In with Holoflower" → /holoflower-checkin

    - "Continue to MAIA" → /maia (skip check-in)

    ↓

    ↓

  /maia (INFORMED)

    └─> MAIA now knows your current state!

  

  2. **Smart Caching (12 Hours)**

  

  - Once you check in, data is fresh for 12 hours

  - Next visit within 12 hours skips straight to MAIA

  - After 12 hours, offered check-in again

  

  3. **Multi-Modal Oracle Foundation**

  

  The interpretation engine is designed to support:

  - **Holoflower** ✅ (built): Somatic/kinesthetic field signature

  - **I Ching** 🔮 (ready): Add hexagram to check-in data

  - **Tarot** 🃏 (ready): Add card spread to check-in data

  

  All feed into MAIA's "fuzzy logic" context.

  

  4. **What MAIA Sees**

  

  When you check in with, for example:

  - **Earth: 9/10** (deeply grounded)

  - **Water: 3/10** (emotions need attention)

  - **Fire: 8/10** (vision is strong)

  - **Air: 6/10** (mental clarity present)

  - **Coherence: 72%** (good integration)

  

  MAIA's system prompt includes:

  User's Current State (from Holoflower check-in):

  

  Elemental Balance:

  - Earth: 9/10 (deeply grounded—practical wisdom is strong)

  - Water: 3/10 (water seeks attention—what emotions need acknowledgment?)

  - Fire: 8/10 (vision burns bright—creative fire flowing)

  - Air: 6/10 (mental clarity present and balanced)

  

  Integration: 72% (integration level)

  Dominant: Earth — Deeply grounded, solid foundation

  Shadow: Water — Emotions asking for space to flow

  

  Guidance for MAIA:

  Support integration—acknowledge both strengths and emerging edges with equal reverence.

  If they mention water, acknowledge this as a sacred invitation, not a deficit.

  If they lean into earth, celebrate this strength and explore its depths.

  

  5. **Sacred Geometry Detection**

  

  The system detects patterns like:

  - **Fire Triangle**: All fire petals high → "Visionary Leader"

  - **Water Triangle**: All water petals high → "Healing Guide"

  - **Cross Patterns**: Vision + Heart → "Aligned Purpose"

  - **Living Mandala**: Perfect balance → Special recognition
