INTRODUCTION

LESSON1: Thank You & Your Spirit Guides

Acknowledgement

First of all, I would like to thank YOU.

It means a lot to me that you decided to buy course. You did everything right and
I firmly believe that this is a step in the right direction to change your life and find
yourself.

I wish you that this course will put you on the path to the answer you were
looking for. Even if it was only the last small step you needed on your way. I am
happy to have inspired you. My mission is to help people/souls/energies on this
earth and to give them light and love. This course is one of many intentions to
spread light and love and maybe an impulse for you to do it too.


I would also like to thank with all my love and strength my guardian angel, my
spirit guides Archangel Raphael, Archangel Metatron and Master Jesus, who
accompany, protect and guide me during this time. I LOVE you! A special thanks
and much love goes to all my friends, souls, wonderful energies and beings who
have accompanied me until here who put a lot of trust, faith and love into this
project and my path.

It is a unique feeling to know that there are people who accept you as you are
and who share these experiences with you. I am infinitely grateful that God/the
Universe/Source has brought us together and that we can help and inspire each
other along the way.

Often we are too caught up in our waking consciousness and are very much
controlled by wrong/old beliefs from this life or previous incarnations. I am
infinitely grateful that my soul/my consciousness/my divine spark/my higher self
always looks out for me and has sent and still sends me messages, chances,
possibilities, thoughts and love. Because the only thing our beloved Creator
(God/Universe/Source/All/Light) knows are the words - "So be it". Therefore, I
hope this course can help you believe a little more in the magic of life and
connect better with God and your Higher Self so that you can find YOU again.
LESSON2: Who am I? (Free Preview Lesson)

Who am I?

Welcome to my first course.

I am already infinitely grateful to you for taking the time to read this. I would like
to introduce myself briefly.

My name is Gerome Raphael, Reiki Master & Teacher, Author, Lightworker and I
am 27 years old. I have been meditating since I was 18 years old, but only
recently have I had transcendental experiences. And that is after I learned to
harness the power of meditation and thought. It is the gateway to your inner
being, the gateway to
higher dimensions, the gateway to Source, the gateway to God - your Higher Self.
I am an explorer, an alchemist, and I am very interested in inner mastery and the
connection to higher worlds.

I know that when we focus on what is inside us and start working with it, it has
an incredible transcendental effect on what is outside. We can literally shape our
reality and be creators. The year 2022 was really breathtaking and I was able to
learn a lot about ancient knowledge and energy work - this includes meditation
as energy work. It helped me indescribably to connect deeper and deeper with
myself and the universe/source/God.

I want to help humanity to reach a higher consciousness and show every single
human being that he is worth to live, to love, to be free, to be healed, to be
happy and give him back his stolen right to determine his life, to recreate his
reality and show him that every human being has a higher purpose and a place
on this earth.

We are all perfect beings and there is enough for everyone. We are here to learn
and experience. For better or for worse. I firmly believe that we can direct this
energy and path, because everything is happening just for us. For your good and
the good of humanity. I know that one of my tasks is to work for the good of all
living beings and to help them. This does not mean that I have to neglect myself,
because I know that there is enough for all of us and that my own mastery has a
high value. It has always been a give and take. It is one planet, one universe, one
cosmos of infinite abundance. If you don't love and heal yourself, it's harder to
externalize that love and infinite gratitude.

Heal yourself and you heal the world. Change yourself and you change the
world, not the other way around.
When you start to change inside, everything around you will change. Every
human being has this huge, unique, great potential to change the world and his
world, but we have forgotten it.

Be aware; As above - so below -- as within - so without. You create your reality
and this course is to get the ball rolling.

So many people are changing for the better and we should all be a part of it. It is
time to say goodbye to the old dogmas and beliefs and move forward into the
new Golden Age.


Are you ready?

Chapter 1: Elevating Your Consciousness

Lesson1: The Basics of Consciousness (Free Preview Lesson)



The Basics of Consciousness



Understanding the Basics of Consciousness is pivotal for spiritual evolution.
Consciousness, the essence of being, embodies the fabric of reality, shaping our
perceptions and interactions. It represents the awareness of one's existence and
the surrounding environment, extending beyond the physical realm into the
depths of the metaphysical and spiritual dimensions. Exploring the depths of
consciousness unravels the intricate tapestry of the universe, revealing profound
insights into the nature of existence and the interconnectedness of all things.

Rooted in ancient wisdom and esoteric knowledge, the 7 Hermetic Laws serve as
guiding principles that underpin the fundamental workings of the universe.
These laws, as outlined in the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, provide a
profound understanding of the dynamics governing both the material and
spiritual realms. Let us explore these laws in detail:

   1. The Law of Mentalism: This law emphasizes the primacy of the mind,
      asserting that all creation is mental. It highlights the power of thought and
      the significance of consciousness in shaping our reality. According to this
      principle, the universe is a mental construct, and our thoughts and
      perceptions influence the fabric of our experiences.

   2. The Law of Correspondence: As above, so below; as within, so without.
      This law elucidates the interconnectedness between the macrocosm and
      the microcosm, asserting that patterns and phenomena observed in one
      realm can be found reflected in others. It emphasizes the inherent
      harmony and resonance within the universe, encouraging seekers to
      recognize the parallels between the spiritual and physical planes.

   3. The Law of Vibration: Everything in the universe is in a constant state of
      motion, resonating at different frequencies. This law underscores the
      dynamic nature of existence, emphasizing the vibrational energies that
      permeate all aspects of reality. It encourages individuals to attune
      themselves to higher frequencies, fostering spiritual growth and alignment
      with universal consciousness.

   4. The Law of Polarity: This law highlights the existence of dualities within
      the universe, emphasizing the interplay between opposites such as light
      and darkness, good and evil, and love and fear. It underscores the notion
      that these seemingly contradictory forces are interconnected and
      necessary for the balance and evolution of the cosmos.

   5. The Law of Rhythm: The universe operates in rhythmic patterns,
      characterized by cycles of expansion and contraction, creation and
      destruction. This law emphasizes the natural ebb and flow of life,
      underscoring the inevitability of change and the need for adaptability and
      resilience in navigating the cosmic dance of existence.

   6. The Law of Cause and Effect: Every action has a corresponding reaction;
      every cause has an effect. This law emphasizes the interconnected nature
      of events and experiences, highlighting the principle of karma and the
      repercussions of our thoughts, words, and deeds. It underscores the
      importance of mindful living and conscious decision-making, fostering
      accountability and personal responsibility.

   7. The Law of Gender: This law emphasizes the presence of masculine and
      feminine energies within all beings and aspects of the universe. It
      underscores the dynamic interplay between these polarities, highlighting
      their role in creation, manifestation, and the perpetuation of life. This
      principle encourages seekers to embrace the balance and harmony
      between these complementary forces, fostering wholeness and unity
      within the self and the cosmos.

Integrating the wisdom of the 7 Hermetic Laws into daily life enables you to
navigate the complexities of existence with clarity and purpose. These timeless
principles provide a framework for understanding the interconnectedness of all
things, fostering a deeper appreciation for the underlying harmony and balance
within the universe.

Meditation, a powerful tool for your spiritual growth and self-discovery, serves as
a gateway to higher realms of consciousness. Through dedicated practice, you
can transcend the limitations of the physical realm, accessing expanded states of
awareness and profound insights into the nature of existence. Meditation
cultivates inner peace, clarity of mind, and heightened intuition, fostering a deep
connection with the divine and facilitating the exploration of spiritual dimensions
beyond the material world.

Delving into the realm of higher consciousness, you can embark on a
transformative journey of self-realization and spiritual awakening. This
exploration transcends the boundaries of conventional perception, offering
glimpses into the mystical realms of existence and the boundless potential of the
human spirit. By cultivating a profound connection with higher realms, you can
tap into the infinite wisdom and guidance of spiritual beings, accessing profound
insights and divine inspiration to navigate life's challenges and fulfill your soul's
purpose.

Occultism, often misunderstood and misrepresented, refers to the study of
hidden knowledge and esoteric wisdom that transcends the boundaries of
conventional understanding. It encompasses a vast array of mystical teachings,
practices, and rituals aimed at unveiling the mysteries of the universe and
harnessing the latent powers of the human spirit. Delving into occult knowledge
allows seekers to explore the realms of the unknown, uncovering ancient truths
and arcane wisdom that offer profound insights into the nature of reality and the
interconnectedness of all things.

In summary, understanding the Basics of Consciousness lays the foundation for
your profound spiritual growth and self-realization. By delving into the wisdom
of the 7 Hermetic Laws, embracing the transformative power of meditation,
exploring the depths of higher realms, and unlocking the mysteries of occult
knowledge, you can embark on a transformative journey of self-discovery, inner
peace, and spiritual enlightenment. This exploration transcends the limitations of
the material world, offering you a profound connection to the divine and a
deeper understanding of the universal forces that shape your existence.



LESSON2: How does your Mind work?



Conscious and Subconscious Realms

The human mind, a complex tapestry of consciousness and subconsciousness,
shapes our perceptions and governs our experiences. Understanding its inner
workings unravels the profound interplay between the conscious mind, our
center of deliberate awareness, and the subconscious mind, the silent force that
steers our behaviors beneath the surface of conscious thought.

Heightened Awareness and Self-Reflection

At the forefront of our mental landscape lies the conscious mind, a realm where
we deliberate, analyze, and express our thoughts. It's akin to the stage where our
ongoing inner dialogue unfolds as we navigate daily activities. This conscious
awareness serves as the architect of our thoughts and behaviors, influencing the
narratives that define our lives.

Reshaping Thought Patterns

Through heightened self-awareness, we gain the power to consciously reshape
our thought patterns. This deliberate rewiring allows us to edit the lines of code
within our subconscious, steering us towards transformative growth and self-
mastery.

That's why it is highly important that you practice daily meditation.

Unveiling the Subconscious Mind

Delving into the depths of our psyche, we encounter the subconscious mind—a
powerful force that operates surreptitiously, influencing our beliefs, behaviors,
and emotions. It operates like an autopilot, guiding our actions and responses
based on the deep-seated programming established over the course of our lives.

Unconscious Behavioral Patterns

Consider the automatic actions we perform effortlessly, such as driving or
walking. These learned behaviors exemplify the prowess of the subconscious
mind. They are etched into our subconscious through repetition, allowing us to
navigate life with minimal conscious intervention.

Conscious Limitations

It's crucial to acknowledge that our conscious mind can only process a fraction of
our cognitive functions, while the subconscious mind dominates the majority of
our mental processes. Our conscious awareness represents our identity,
thoughts, decisions, and personality, while the subconscious realm houses our
deeply ingrained beliefs, perspectives, and behavioral patterns.

Path to Transformation

Within the depths of the subconscious lie a myriad of beliefs—about the self,
money, relationships, and the world at large. These beliefs are often established
during our formative years and become deeply embedded within our
subconscious. However, the recognition dawns that, despite not authoring our
initial programming, we have the capacity to reprogram and shape our
subconscious beliefs as adults.

Decoding Mental Frequencies

Our brain's activity operates through various brain waves, each representing
different mental states and functions. From the deep sleep of delta waves to the
heightened cognitive activity of gamma waves, these frequencies orchestrate the
symphony of our consciousness, guiding us through the realms of sleep,
relaxation, engagement, and hyperactivity.

The Solfeggio Frequencies, rooted in ancient musical traditions, are a set of
specific tones believed to impart spiritual blessings when incorporated into
meditation and sound therapy. Each frequency within the Solfeggio scale is
associated with distinct healing properties and is said to resonate with different
aspects of human consciousness.

These frequencies include:

   1. 174 Hz - Known for its ability to promote a sense of safety, security, and overall well-
      being.
   2. 285 Hz - Associated with promoting energy balance and deep healing of body and
      mind.
   3. 396 Hz - Revered for its capacity to release feelings of guilt and fear, fostering a sense
      of peace and liberation.
   4. 417 Hz - Recognized for facilitating positive change and breaking down negative
      thought patterns and behaviors.
   5. 528 Hz - Known as the frequency of love and miracles, believed to restore harmony
      and balance.
   6. 639 Hz - Revered for enhancing communication, understanding, and connection in
      relationships.
   7. 741 Hz - Associated with the power of self-expression and problem-solving,
      promoting a sense of inner clarity and creativity.
   8. 852 Hz - Known for its ability to awaken intuition and heighten spiritual awareness,
      fostering inner peace and spiritual enlightenment.
   9. 963 Hz - Revered for its connection to the awakening of the perfect state, often
      associated with higher consciousness and transcendence.

Integrating the Solfeggio Frequencies into meditation practices can amplify the
benefits of mindfulness, promoting emotional healing, spiritual growth, and
overall well-being. By attuning ourselves to these sacred frequencies, we can tap
into the profound potential of sound and vibration to harmonize the body, mind,
and spirit.

Additionally, I will be providing free self-made Solfeggio Frequencies every
month, designed to facilitate a deeper meditation experience and enhance the
journey of self-discovery and inner transformation. These carefully crafted
frequencies aim to amplify the healing potential of sound, fostering a
harmonious resonance within the mind, body, and spirit. Stay tuned for these
monthly offerings, as we embark together on a transformative odyssey of self-
realization and spiritual elevation.

Shaping Our Early Years

During the formative years of 0 to 7, our minds are highly susceptible to external
influences, absorbing beliefs and behaviors from our immediate environment.
This period lays the groundwork for our identity, shaping our personalities based
on the influences of our caregivers, society, and cultural norms.

A Driving Force in Human Experience

Belief serves as a powerful force within us, shaping our perceptions, actions, and
experiences. Our beliefs can either propel us toward growth and success or
hinder our progress. Understanding the influence of beliefs in our lives allows us
to take control of our thought patterns, leading to positive shifts in our behaviors
and outcomes.



LESSON3: How to work with your Mind!



How to Work with Your Mind

Our minds, akin to intricate computers, possess the remarkable capability of
upgrading their operating systems. Consider the inception of our mental journey
as a culmination of inherited software, a symphony of beliefs and patterns gifted
by our environment. But therein lies the pivotal crossroads—do we passively
inherit these beliefs or do we aspire to become the architects of our mental
destiny? Let's embark on a profound exploration of how we can consciously
navigate and reshape our minds to craft our unique symphony.

Conscious Reprogramming

The process of rewriting our mental codes initiates with a profound sense of
awareness, unveiling the threads of inherited beliefs woven into our
consciousness.

Awareness

Develop a vigilant awareness of the mental narratives that echo within your
consciousness. Recognize the origin of these inherited beliefs and the impact
they wield on your thought patterns and behaviors.

Research

Foster a healthy sense of skepticism, questioning the validity and relevance of
these inherited beliefs. Scrutinize their alignment with your authentic self and
discern whether they serve your growth or hinder your potential.
Selection

Consciously curate beliefs that align with your personal growth and authenticity.
Deliberately choose wisdom from various sources, fashioning a tapestry of truths
that resonate with the essence of your being.

Affirmation

Embed these consciously chosen beliefs within your psyche through
affirmations. Repetitively affirm these beliefs to reinforce their presence,
anchoring them deep within your subconscious for holistic integration.

Practice

Consistently practice and embody these chosen beliefs, allowing them to
gradually replace the inherited ones. Over time, these beliefs evolve into the
guiding principles that shape reality.

Reading

Much like outdated software, our current mental databases may no longer serve
our evolving aspirations. Engaging with transformative books can serve as the
catalyst for this conscious evolution.

Embrace reading as the gateway to reprogram your mind. Initiate this
transformation with a simple commitment, setting aside a few moments each
day to engage with transformational literature.

Anticipate and overcome the mental resistance that might arise as you engage
with this transformative practice. Employ affirmations to reframe your
perception of reading, recognizing it as a valuable opportunity for growth and
self-development.

Embrace the essence of the literature you engage with, focusing on depth rather
than quantity. Revisit transformative texts, allowing their wisdom to unfold and
integrate into the fabric of your consciousness.

Meditation

Meditation serves as a powerful tool for cultivating inner awareness and
tranquility.
Observe

Recognize that you are not your thoughts but rather the conscious observer of
them. Embrace meditation as a practice that allows you to detach from the
incessant chatter of the mind and cultivate a state of inner calm.

Breath Awareness

Utilize focused breathing as an anchor for your meditation practice. Redirect
your attention to your breath whenever your thoughts drift, nurturing the ability
to refocus and cultivate a heightened sense of awareness.

Harness the foundational power of awareness in your journey towards replacing
negative thought patterns. Cultivate a conscious shield that protects your mind
from the influx of negativity, allowing space for transformative growth and self-
realization.

Chapter 2: Sacred Geometry

Lesson 1: Mysticism of Sacred Geometry (FREE PREVIEW)



Forms, Effect & Meaning


This chapter is about how the specific Sacred Geometry Forms work and what
they mean.



But first, what is Sacred Geometry anyway and how can it improve my life
and support such a transformation?
The structure of the universe (in the microcosm and macrocosm - as above, so
below; as within, so without) is called Sacred Geometry. Simple mathematical
structures and geometric patterns bring forth the entire creation. Sacred
Geometry helps us humans to return to our divine origin.

Our lives become simpler, richer and more enlightened through the sacred
symbols. Life is formed through sacred geometry. The occurrence of chaos or
randomness in the cosmos, on earth and in our daily lives is only a surface
phenomenon. Basically, the entire universe is made up of patterns and
structures that follow a certain symmetry and order known as sacred geometry.
These laws and patterns apply to all aspects of our existence, including the
physical world, but also to our life paths, events, thoughts and emotions.



How does Sacred Geometry help you in your daily life?


People's deep-rooted memories of the basic divine order are awakened by
simply looking at the shapes and symbols. There are times when you probably
cannot get away from a symbol, because the energy and power contained in
these symbols is very strong and wonderfully beautiful. The information is
literally absorbed by the body. Nature is the most perfect manifestation of the
divine plan. This is also the reason why we enjoy flowers, trees and landscapes.
We have come a long way from the beginnings and their simplicity in our man
made structures. Sacred Geometry takes you directly back to the original state of
divine perfection.

You can use the Sacred Forms profitably in your daily life. You must learn to
recognize and understand them. By attuning your mind to these geometric
patterns and surrounding yourself with them, you can navigate through life more
easily and with fewer challenges. I wanted to specialize in a small number and
found 3 a very beautiful number, which in itself is also very sacred. Besides,
these 3 sacred symbols are among themost interesting and important - in my
opinion. Therefore, in the following 3 small chapters I will introduce each symbol
once. This is for a deeper understanding of my meditation, how you can tune in
and use the energy of these symbols.

This also includes the most important affirmations and feelings you should focus
on. Just be aware that this transformation that is coming into your life now is not
going to happen overnight. It is a long-term process that can bring a lot of fun,
joy and happiness. All the more I am happy to be able to accompany you on this
path. I'm just asking you to stay on the track. I'll also give you some guidance to
help you understand all these concepts easily.
Lesson 2: Metatron’s Cube

Metatron's Cube



Metatron's cube is a geometric symbol composed of all the Platonic solids. These
are the fundamental building blocks of all creation and order.




The 5 platonic bodies are:

Tetrahedron (four triangles):




Hexahedron (the cube or cube; that is, six squares):
Octahedron (eight triangles):




Dodecahedron (twelve pentagons):




Icosahedron (twenty triangles):
According to numerous legends, the archangel Metatron is the only angel who
has seen God and the only archangel who has a physical incarnation has gone
through to ascend to the archangel state. His boundless energy is reflected in his
fiery eyes. According to the "Key of Enoch" Metatron is the "Garment of Shaddai"
(that means the "clothing of God"). The visible manifestation of the Godhead as
the "Garment of the Father" - creator of the outer world.

It is said that Archangel Metatron is above duality. Therefore, the daily use of
Metatron's cube leads you to realize the highest and greatest meaning for your
own existence and incarnation on this planet. We were all created as a perfect
blueprint to fulfill a special task on this planet. We all have to learn to direct and
manipulate energy (for good only!).

However, we all go through the process of forgetting and disconnect from the
true purpose of our existence. Your higher purpose gets lost and
Metatron/Metatron's Cube can help you remember, help you reconnect with
your Higher Self - the Source.

It is infinitely important to me that we rediscover and remember the roots of our
divine lineage. This can free the mind again and establish contact with the Higher
Self. In my meditation I use Metatron's Cube because this symbol is a powerful,
transformative energy of infinite knowledge. In connection with our artwork, the
initiation into the "System of Sacred Geometry Metatron's Cube" and the request
for guidance and support from the Archangel Metatron, the energy becomes
even more intense and cannot be compared to any other energy. It is truly
transformative and filled with infinite love and knowledge.

Meditation with this symbol also restores the balance between the female and
male poles of the body. Also, you can ask this energy/symbol questions when
you are stuck. Just listen to yourself and let your intuition guide you. Because the
answers to all your questions lie within you. Your Higher Self/Source/God/the
Angels always want to help you and are always with you. You can hear, feel and
perceive them. Trust your intuition and do not doubt your intuition - do not
doubt yourself. You are wonderful and always loved! We all have and possess
this ability, we just need to reawaken and train it. Please remember to use its
energy wisely, only for the good and benefit of yourself and those around you.
For spiritual people who work with Metatron, this unique symbol is the perfect
tool and a reliable companion.



Lesson3: The Flower of Life

The Flower of Life



Probably the most famous sacred geometry symbol is the flower of life.




This wonderful symbol is associated with many positive qualities, including
healing, protection, harmony and recovery. The 19 interlocking circles are
considered the original blueprint of creation. They convey the eternity and
connectedness of all things. One could also say you are looking at God's face/the
face of the source. A very strong energy is hidden in this sacred symbol. From
this can also be derived all known geometric shapes and numerous other sacred
symbols.


• Metatron's Cube
• The Merkaba
• The platonic bodies
• The Kabbalistic Tree of Life
• The structure of human DNA
• And so much more
Even the ancient people were aware of the deep meaning and powerful
influence, as well as the beauty of geometric patterns and symbols. Throughout
history, people also knew how to use them, for example, for various purposes
and rituals. Only this knowledge has been lost and I would like to show how we
can regain this power, this wonderful energy and knowledge about it. The Flower
of Life creates a unique, energetic vibrational pattern that deeply harmonizes its
environment.

That is why the flower of life is associated with the following properties:


• Bringing the body and soul back into harmony and unison
• Healing & Recovery
• The harmonizing and energizing of rooms, food and objects
• Dissolving negative and destructive energies,
• And much more.


The symbol serves as a gateway to higher states of consciousness during
meditation. The light body process is supported by it. In addition, it serves as an
image to protect the room from harmful energies.



Lesson4: The MerKaBa



The MerKaBa



Two identical tetrahedra (pyramids) form the ascension symbol Merkaba.
They lie inside each other and together form the star tetrahedron.

Today, the Merkaba is closely connected to the process of the Light Body, which
began in 1987 for the Cosmic Convergence, reached critical mass in 2012, and is
expected to continue until 2032, when we will enter the Golden Age together. We
all need to help and adjust to this.

Moreover, it is connected with the conscious perception into the fifth dimension
(5D). The symbol increases the vibration when placed in the room. The physical,
astral and spiritual bodies are brought into harmony. The Merkaba is the means
of transportation of the gods for people on the journey of transformation and
experience, seeking a way to connect with the Source.

The Merkaba is a symbol of awakening and a link for spiritual practitioners. It
represents the duality of ying and yang, male and female. A perfect geometric
miracle for spiritual growth on the path to self, so you can connect with and
experience the Akashic Chronicle more easily and naturally.

As you can see, the Merkaba is the symbol of transformation and also a perfect
helper on your path to inner mastery and meditation practice.



LESSON5: What are the benefits?(free preview)

What are the benefits?



The concept of true sovereignty is rooted in the freedom from interference and
constraints, allowing you to follow the guidance of your spirit (soul/intuition) with
unwavering certainty. In the beginning, we recognized ourselves as descendants
of God, designated as natural heirs to His kingdom. However, the choice to
embrace duality led to a loss of balance, prompting actions primarily influenced
by our lower chakras. Reclaiming our original state entails reconnecting with our
roots and rediscovering our sovereignty. The Adam Kadmon embodies an
individual who harnesses all their talents and powers without limitations.
Embracing this sovereignty empowers us to live a harmonious and fulfilled life.

Metatron's influence transcends duality, enabling you to reclaim the capabilities
of your Light Body. You were originally designed as a perfect blueprint for a
specific function on this planet. Many individuals traverse numerous lifetimes
without ever comprehending their true purpose or function.
The creation holds an inherent purpose and order, with energies beyond the
fourth dimension maintaining their pristine state and arrangement. The
archetypes within Metatron's Cube realign your entire energy system with the
perfection of these energies. Consequently, your original purpose is unveiled,
and the brilliance of your essence is revealed and brought into manifestation.
Jesus the Christ's call to "be ye therefore perfect, even as My Father in Heaven is
perfect" signifies the attainability of this state.

The core focus of this work lies in restoring balance, primarily addressing the
prevalent imbalance between male and female energies within individuals and
on Earth. When we fell from grace, we lost the equilibrium between these
energies, relegating the feminine energy to a secondary position, rendering it
undervalued and even detrimental. However, the restoration of balance is
facilitated through specific meditative practices.

Represented by the Serpent or Kundalini energy, the female energy is associated
with the concept of the "Mother" and is traditionally depicted as coiled at the
base of the spine. Metatron's Cube meditation facilitates the safe and automatic
awakening of the Kundalini, thereby fostering balance between the feminine and
masculine poles within the body. This process doesn't disrupt your daily
functionality, unlike instances where the energy rises too quickly or dramatically
during meditation, resulting in adverse effects.

In tantric meditation, the objective is to awaken the feminine energy, allowing for
the union of Shiva and Shakti, representing the male and female energies,
respectively. As you progress with this meditation, the Kundalini embarks on a
journey to reunite with the Father, initiating a transformative process that
enables you to access the capabilities of your Divine Parents, the tools of
creation.

As the union between the feminine and masculine energies is completed, they
ultimately merge into the Formless, Genderless Void of God. Referring to the
Kabalistic Tree of Life model, the progression from ten to one, from Malkuth to
Kether, signifies a return to the primal formlessness. The Mother, as the creator
of form, enters her fullness upon merging with her True Counterpart, not
surrendering anything but rather gaining completeness. This understanding
resonates with the realization that, despite the reference to God in masculine
terms in sacred texts, the concept of God transcends gender-specific attributes,
encompassing a holistic and comprehensive essence.
   Lesson 7: Facilitating the process

Facilitating the Process

All of this does NOT happen overnight. Your Higher Self makes sure you are
ready before this process begins and you will be. If you wish to expedite and
maximize this whole process, there are things you can do to assure that matters
move along smoothly, albeit rapidly. They are as follows:

Brain Hemispheric Synchronization

This is the most important item in this section. Since the hemispheres of our
brains correspond to the female (right) and male (left), balance cannot really
occur until the computer (the brain) of our system is functioning correctly. We
tend to be either too flaky and ungrounded (right imbalance), or bull-headed and
overly-analytical (left imbalance). By entraining our brain via sound and lights
using brain synchronization machines or labyrinth work, our brain hemispheres
and our whole body and energy system, work in perfect concert. This balancing
alone can bring about amazing results within us. Coupled with Metatron's Cube
and the meditation thereon, it is a combination difficult to beat.

You will find links to Self-Made Hemisync Meditation later in the course!

Physical Detoxification

Toxic Food, Toxic Mind. Although too much emphasis should not be given to our
lowest member, the human body, it IS necessary to keep it working properly if
we wish to advance. According to Ayurveda, the centuries-old system of healing
from India, there are certain substances that are detoxifying and beneficial for all
body types the main one being ALOE VERA. Because it is a blood purifier (among
its many attributes), daily consumption of at least 8 ounces acts as a steady
detoxifier, without having to endure any radical fasting or other taxing
techniques. Because Ayurveda is "specific herbology", it is the most precise and
beneficial system of preventative medicine available to us. Two excellent books
on the subject are "Ayurvedic Healing" by David Frawley and "Ayurveda: The
Science of Self-Healing" by Dr. Vasant Lad. Both are excellent to keep around for
steady reference.

Body Scrubbing

The skin is the largest organ in (on) our bodies. Care of the skin should figure
into your everyday regimen. Since the skin is constantly regenerating (as our
other organs) and sloughing off debris, it is important to keep it moving (off of
you!). Any drugstore will have "shower brushes", and it should be used daily to
keep a steady level of detoxification.
Magnets

Our bodies are like giant "D" batteries; we have a positive and negative pole, just
as batteries do. There is a gentleman in Northern California who offers
instructions (and the magnets themselves if you cannot make your own) on how
to construct beneficial hand and foot magnets that keep your system in
alignment with the North and South Poles of the planet. Although I haven't used
them very long, the technology is sound, and they DO assist in keeping the
energy field in alignment.

I Ching

If you dare! The I Ching is a 5,000 year-old Chinese oracle that you may learn,
keep and consult as to what conduct is most appropriate and when. It is really
your Higher Self communicating with your conscious mind from the "outside-in",
and can act as a highly accurate, if sometimes stern, consultant, during this
process of transformation. When engaging with Sacred Geometry (the Cube), you
will find your reality base aligning with that of the Christ, and with all of those
Christed Beings who have walked and transcended the cycle of birth and death.
Unfortunately, this is 180 degrees from the reality base of this three-dimensional
world. Therefore, special circumstances require special action, and the I Ching is
always on top of what is "correct" for you do do (or not do) during this process.

In closing, the following is from the Keys of Enoch, Key 308:37:

" ...Enoch also explained to me that there would be three resurrections
depending upon the con- sciousness state of belief. Those who would unify their
spiritual consciousness with ALL FIVE BODIES (emphasis added) would be taken
first.....
....And those who are operating only with the pure physical vehicle would be
given a physical witness at the end of time (emphasis added) so that when the
chambers of the earth break open they might (emphasis added) be prepared to
be quickened at the final resurrection."


Well, I don't know about you, but I'd just as soon go with the first group!

You have the tools before you to take you all the way. Who would have thought
of it - all on a piece of paper costing, what, 7 cents? God has a great sense of
humor.

This is called the "Big Three" clearing. Your life will proceed so much smoother if
you do this clearing EVERY DAY, since Christed energies will NOT cooperate and
flow when negativity is present.

REVOCATION OF VOWS

I, the being known as _____________ do hereby revoke and renounce any and all
agreements and contracts, made by me, with any organization, entity, alliance,
group, person, being, family member, spouse; all human beings, all incarnates
and discarnates; all astral beings, all energies in all universes, that are NOT of the
Christ vibration and do not serve my highest good. This applies to all agreements
and contracts, made by me, known or unknown, for all time frames, spaces and
locations, for all dimensions, past present and future lifetimes. I cut the cords to
these agreements, they no longer have any access to me or power over me, they
are completely NULL AND VOID. I state this to the face of God in the name of
May-Tah-Tay-Roh-oh-Noo. So let this be written in the Book of Life. And so it is.

IMPLANT REMOVAL

With your left hand on the symbol to the right and the right hand on the crown
(top of the head), state:


BE FREE, BE FREE, BE FREE

BE FREE, BE FREE, BE FREE

BE FREE, BE FREE, BE FREE

BE FREE, BE FREE, BE FREE




Keep hand on head for 2-5 minutes.



ENTITY CLEARING
State aloud with authority:


I wish to heal all of the entities around my auric field, around all of my bodies,
around this entire ____________ (room, house, apartment, etc.).


"Dear Ones, you are healed and forgiven, healed and forgiven, healed and
forgiven. You are lifted to your Christ self. You're surrounded by the Christ love.
You're surrounded by the Christ Light. You're free from fear, pain, anger, death
and the earth vibration. I send you all now to your rightiul places; to your next
step on your own path to enlightenment. Go now, in peace. Go in peace. Go in
peace."




LESSON 8: More Occult Knowledge

Metatron's Sigil on the Rose Cross:

This is one of the most powerful sheets of paper on the planet! The Rose Cross is
made up of the 22 letters of the hebrew alphabet. By spelling out Metatron's
name in hebrew, this figure appears, and is in effect, Metatron's signature. You're
aware from your human signature, the glyph itself carries the vibration of the
one it represents. Although the emphasis is not on the open-eye meditation of
the Rose Cross, it is included for absolute protection and as a pathway, when
inscribed, into the actual Metatronic energy. It also makes a fine specimen for
open-eye meditation, itself!
The Hierarchy of our Father Universe:

This diagram, from the Keys of Enoch, is included to show Metatron's position in
the whole scheme of things. As you can see from the pointing arrow, Metatron is
the First Expression of God; truly, the Voice of The Father.
The Serpent of Wisdom:

This diagram of the Kabalistic Tree of Life is taken from the Complete Golden
Dawn Book of Magic. It is herein included to show Metatron's position on the
Tree of Life - at the very top (around Kether, the tiret Sephiroth). You can't get
much higher on the food chain than this! This diagram is also included for the
Serpent illustration, which will be discussed later in the section regarding
Kundalini.
Platonic Solids, Tattwas and Organ Correspondences:
The five platonic solids; the cube, tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron and
dodecahedron, are the building blocks of all creation and form, and are
contained within Metatron's Cube.

The five Hindu Tattwas; prithivi-earth, tejas-fire, vayu-air, apas- water and akasa-
spirit are also represented in Metatron's cube, as they directly correspond to the
five platonic solids, the chakras and the internal organs.

The following page illustrates the correspondences. The table below gives the
names and attributes of the solids and tattwas, to be matched directly with the
exhibit on the following page.
The Chakra System:

The chakras are the "wheels within wheels", the seven (plus) energy centers in
our bodies that correspond directly with the glands. Clearance of the chakras
allows life force energy to flow directly through them, from the lowest to the
crown, the seat of God consciousness and Self-awareness. This exhibit shows
how the energy centers are represented in Metatron's Cube, and therefore
positively affected.




The Kabalistic Tree of Life:
The Tree of Life is not a model that exists somewhere in space; we are IN the
tree; we ARE the tree. In this depiction of the Cube, you will see that even Daath
is represented, which is considered "hidden" and not yet clearly defined. On the
following page, this diagram is included so that you can compare positioning of
the sephira around the human body, and how closely it relates to the positioning
in Metatron's Cube.
The Ten Pythagorean Numbers on the Kabalistic Tree of Life:

According to H.P. Blavatsky, Israel Regardie and Pythagoras, the Ten Pythagorean
numbers, the ten sephira on the Kabalistic Tree of Life, and the ten dots on the
Tetraktys (on the following page) ARE ALL THE SAME. They are all geometric
representations of powerful energies governing all of creation. They can also be
found in Metatron's Cube, as illustrated. Even though the focus
is not on the Flower of Life in this work, it is included on the page following the
"Numbers" to illustrate the Tetraktys; this is also another "all-encompassing"
symbol.
Planetary Correspondences in the Tree of Life:

All of planets including the sun, moon, zodiac and "no name", are shown in this
diagram. When you are connecting with this symbol in meditation, you are also
accessing the energy of the cosmos.




The Microcosm and Macrocosm:

Before we can be of true service to the universe, we must be in balance;
otherwise, our projections stand to do more harm than good. All that exists in
the universe exists within us we are a small, compact version of all creation! The
Envelopes of Light These final three diagrams show what appears to be an
envelope: first closed, then half open, then completely open. It may be mere
coincidence, but it would make sense that Metatron's Cube takes us from a
closed, asleep state, and opens us up to the inspiration of our Higher Self, which
we can receive once we are completely "open" to it.




Metatron's Cube: Now that you know what it does, here's one for you! It would
be a grand idea to keep it on your ceiling and to look at it daily (details to follow).
Envelopes of light through which we receive information our Higher Self and our
Christed brethren. Envelope is closed here.




In Kez 107:12 of the Keys of Enoch, it states:

"Metatron provides the light envelopes for the Tought-Forms of the Ancient of
Days.."



Envelopes of light, continued. Here is the envelope half open.
Final envelope, fully opened. Notice that it opens above the crown (See "One in
the Cube" diagram)
CHAPTER 3: KUNDALINI ENERGY

Welcome to 'The Path to Source & Sacred Geometry,' an immersive journey that
delves into the depths of spiritual awakening and self-realization through the
exploration of Kundalini Energy.



What is the Kundalini Energy?

In the realm of esoteric philosophy, Kundalini is often described as the dormant
cosmic energy coiled at the base of the spine, representing the primal life force that,
when awakened, leads to profound spiritual enlightenment and self-discovery. This
mystical energy, often envisioned as a coiled serpent, is believed to traverse the
body's seven chakras, igniting a transformative journey that culminates in a
heightened state of consciousness and a profound connection to the divine. Ancient
spiritual texts and traditions, including Hindu and Tantric scriptures, have expounded
upon the profound implications of Kundalini awakening, portraying it as the ultimate
goal of human existence, the realization of one's true nature, and the attainment of
union with the cosmic source.



Who practices Kundalini Energy and Awakening?

The practice of Kundalini Energy and Awakening has been a sacred tradition within
various ancient spiritual and mystical traditions, including certain schools of yoga,
tantra, and esoteric knowledge. In Hinduism, the concept of Kundalini is intricately
linked with the practice of yoga and the awakening of the spiritual centers within the
body. Yogic practitioners have long sought to harness the latent power of Kundalini
through dedicated spiritual practices, meditation, and breathwork, aiming to unlock
the transformative potential of this cosmic energy and attain a state of divine union
and self-realization. Similarly, within the framework of Tantric philosophy, Kundalini
Energy is revered as the embodiment of divine feminine energy, representing the
creative and transformative power inherent in the universe and the human psyche.
Tantric adepts have traditionally engaged in elaborate rituals, meditative practices,
and esoteric techniques to awaken the dormant Kundalini, facilitating spiritual
evolution and the realization of the interconnectedness of all existence.



What do we know about the Kundalini Energy?

The concept of Kundalini Energy has been shrouded in mystery and reverence
throughout the ages, drawing upon ancient texts, spiritual teachings, and personal
accounts of spiritual awakening experiences. It is believed to be the key to unlocking
the secrets of human potential, granting access to higher realms of consciousness
and facilitating a profound union with the cosmic source. The intricate interplay
between Kundalini Energy and the subtle energy centers of the body has intrigued
scholars and spiritual practitioners, spurring a continuous exploration of its
transformative power and profound effects on human consciousness. Various
esoteric traditions and spiritual lineages have expounded upon the nature of
Kundalini, emphasizing its role in the process of self-transformation, the awakening of
higher states of consciousness, and the harmonization of the individual with the
universal cosmic forces.




As we embark on this profound journey through the realms of Kundalini Energy and
sacred geometry, we invite you to discover the intricate tapestry of esoteric
knowledge, mystical practices, and spiritual wisdom that illuminates the path to self-
realization and divine union. Through a comprehensive exploration of ancient
teachings, transformative practices, and the symbology of sacred geometry, we aim
to provide you with a holistic understanding of the profound significance of Kundalini
Energy in the context of spiritual evolution, self-discovery, and the realization of your
true divine nature.
LESSON 2: CONNECTING THE DOTS
LESSON 3: You don't need Yoga to awaken the Kundalini Energy

In the realm of spiritual awakening and the pursuit of higher consciousness, the
awakening of the Kundalini Energy has often been associated with elaborate yogic
practices, intricate postures, and specialized breathing techniques. While yoga has
historically played a significant role in the cultivation and harnessing of this latent
cosmic energy, the evolving landscape of spiritual practices and esoteric knowledge
has revealed an alternative path to Kundalini awakening—one that emphasizes the
power of meditation and breathwork, coupled with the utilization of sacred geometry,
such as Metatron's Cube, as a catalyst for profound spiritual transformation and self-
realization. This innovative approach to Kundalini awakening has opened new
doorways for spiritual seekers and adepts, offering a more accessible and inclusive
method to tap into the profound reservoir of cosmic energy and unlock the hidden
potential of human consciousness.



In the context of this course, 'The Path to Source & Sacred Geometry,' the focal point
lies in the utilization of meditation practice and the strategic integration of Metatron's
Cube, an ancient symbol of sacred geometry representing the interconnectedness of
all existence and the divine blueprint of the universe. Through the profound synergy
of meditation and the transformative energy of Metatron's Cube, participants are
guided on a transformative journey that transcends the traditional confines of yogic
practice, allowing for a deeper exploration of the self and a heightened connection to
the cosmic source. The practice of meditation serves as a powerful tool for cultivating
inner awareness, harnessing the latent potential of the mind, and fostering a
harmonious balance between the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of one's
being.



Moreover, the integration of Metatron's Cube within the meditative framework serves
as a conduit for accessing the higher realms of consciousness, facilitating the
activation of the subtle energy centers within the body, and harmonizing the flow of
Kundalini Energy throughout the chakra system. The intricate geometric patterns and
sacred symbolism embedded within Metatron's Cube create a resonant field of
energy that catalyzes the awakening process, allowing individuals to tap into the
profound reservoir of spiritual energy and embark on a transformative journey of self-
discovery and divine realization. By engaging with the profound energies emanating
from Metatron's Cube and immersing oneself in the practice of meditation and
breathwork, participants can awaken the dormant potential of the Kundalini Energy
and unlock the gateway to higher states of consciousness, inner wisdom, and
spiritual enlightenment.



The profound implications of this innovative approach to Kundalini awakening
underscore the inherent potential within each individual to harness the transformative
power of meditation and sacred geometry, transcending the conventional boundaries
of yogic practice and unlocking the limitless possibilities of self-realization and divine
union. As we delve deeper into the realms of meditation, breathwork, and the
transformative energy of Metatron's Cube, we invite you to embrace the inherent
potential within yourself, tap into the boundless reservoir of cosmic energy, and
embark on a transformative journey that transcends the limitations of traditional
spiritual practices, allowing for a profound union with the cosmic source and the
realization of your true divine nature.



LESSON 4: FACTS ABOUT THE KUNDALINI

Kundalini, the mystical concept often symbolized as the coiled serpent energy lying
dormant within each individual, possesses the profound ability to unlock extraordinary
spiritual experiences and facilitate a deep union with the divine. For centuries, this
enigmatic force has captured the imagination of spiritual seekers and practitioners,
leading many to embark on the path of self-discovery and enlightenment. While the
ancient traditions and scriptures have revered the concept of Kundalini, recent
attempts have been made to demystify its nature by framing it within the context of
modern scientific understanding.



The exploration of Kundalini within the framework of contemporary science has led
some researchers to propose an intriguing association with the right Vagus nerve, a
fundamental component of the autonomic nervous system. This nerve, characterized
by its intricate network of efferent and afferent fibers, assumes a critical role in
regulating various vital involuntary functions within the human body. From the
rhythmic beating of the heart to the intricate processes of the respiratory and
digestive systems, the Vagus nerve exerts a pervasive influence over these essential
physiological activities, ensuring their seamless coordination and operation. The
profound implications of this proposition suggest that the dormant potential of
Kundalini can be awakened through deliberate and disciplined practices, enabling
individuals to establish a conscious and voluntary influence over the Vagus nerve
which also regulates your Stress-Level and healing properties of your body. Stress
and Healing is interconnected.



The intricate connections of the right Vagus nerve with vital plexuses, especially
within the solar plexus and other significant areas, establish its pivotal role in
governing and regulating the activities of the various interconnected physiological
systems. By stimulating or depressing the right Vagus nerve, individuals can directly
influence and modulate the functions of critical bodily organs, thereby exerting a
considerable degree of control over their physical well-being and holistic health.



Nonetheless, the profound wisdom embedded within ancient spiritual disciplines
posits that through the diligent and dedicated practice of this technique, individuals
can gradually attain a heightened degree of mastery over their physiological and
psychological states. This mastery, achieved through the awakening and activation of
the dormant Kundalini energy.
Deshbandhu's remarkable demonstration of the ability to halt the movement of his
heart and arterial pulse stands as a poignant testament to the transformative power
and latent potential inherent within the awakened Kundalini. His extraordinary feat
serves as a compelling illustration of the remarkable capabilities that can be unlocked
through the conscious and intentional activation of this dormant spiritual energy,
highlighting the immense transformative power that lies at the heart of ancient
spiritual practices.




LESSON 5: Benefits of raising the Kundalini Energy

Benefits of raising the Kundalini-Energy and what to expect from it



The following are references from different publications that succinctly address
this subject:

From "The Art of Everyday Ecstasy" by Margot Anand (Broadway Books: 1998):
"The distortions that divide men and women in the world flow from the split
between the inner man and woman in each of us, a split that goes back to the
mythic subjugation of the Goddess by a jealous and warlike deity. And that inner
split between feminine and masculine, sex and Spirit, body and soul, energy and
consciousness, separates us from the healing power of ecstasy, both in ourselves
and in our culture.
We must not seek to replace the male deity with female, but to restore the divine
feminine to the world. And especially her reunion with the divine masculine, who
in his wrathful appearance as God the patriarch is wounded by her absence just
as we, their children, have suffered unbearably from their separation."

From Energies of Transformation by Bonnie Greenwell, Ph.D. (Self-Published:
1990):
"According to Vedic scriptures Kundalini energy is the fundamental power of
creation and the primary consciousness of the universe. Swami Vishnu Tirtha
described it in a classic volume, Kundalini, Devatma Shakti as a universal cosmic
energy/consciousness which manifests from the all-pervasive Brahman. This
energy appears in the dynamic state while creating and after completing the
process in hand, it conceals itself by becoming static residual energy in the
center of an individual being. Here it is coiled, until it is awakened and reverses
its path to the source."

In another section, it states:
"Then the spirit must be allowed to dive down into the abdomen (solar plexus).
The energy then has intercourse with spirit, and spirit unites with the energy and
crystallizes itself. This is the method of starting the work. In time the primal spirit
transforms itself in the swelling of life into the true energy."

And finally:
"When the Kundalini is aroused (one) progresses very rapidly on the path of
spiritual evolution. He realizes the full potential of the body and mind, attains
inner peace, harmony and integration, and ultimately experiences the sublime
truth of unity in diversity- the fact that all life is one seamless fabric."

From the Yoga Journal, July 1998: The article, "When Kali Comes To Call"):
"Shakti is power, energy in both its dynamic and static forms (we know its static
form better as "matter"). Every imaginable thing and action in the universe rises
from, exists in, and eventually returns to t... primordial shakti pool. Absolute,
unchangeable, permanent, all pervasive consciousness is the rock upon which
the universe stands, and our cosmos and all conceivable cosmoses assemble
themselves on that rock from the substance of dynamism of shakti."

The article further states:
"At the base of the subtle spinal cord in the subtle body lies the residual shakti of
individuation, an energy which remains unavailable to the individual so long as
his or her consciousness remains firmly entrenched in the mundane. This energy
is our personal fragment of the cosmic power of self-identification."

Even though the awakening and rising of Kundalini is a natural benefit of
Formless Geoemtry Meditation / Open-Eye meditation on sacred geometry,
specifically, Metatron's Cube, it is not completely passive. Because Kundalini is
represented by our sexual, reproductive energy, great movement of sexual
energy is to be expected, and is part of the process.

To keep from being disturbed by the energy, or immersing yourself in some sort
of fruitless orgiastic behavior, if you direct the energy to your head (without any
special breathing or techniques), by simply turning your awareness to your
crown when the energy is moving, it will follow your guide after all, it IS your
body, and you are the master (potentially!). There are complicated techniques
and manuals that instruct one on how to arouse and move the energy, but I have
found that specific instructions are not necessary. As long as Kundalini knows the
destination, She WILL find her way.


Some of the other benefits you can expect from the rising of Kundalini:

   •   Psychic Awareness Seeing or feeling auras
   •   The ability to do hands-on healing
   •   Spontaneous remembrance of past lives
   •   Channeling poetry, art, books and other information Out-of-Body Experiences
   •   Psychokinetic experiences
   •   Precognitive visions or intuition
   •   Synchronistic events
   •   The ability to use one's energy to balance disturbed energy in others
   •   Increased comprehension of spiritual scriptures
   •   Feeling the ability to influence others
   •   Instinctive awareness of what one needs to do
   •   An expanded vision of reality
   •   Feeling aware of the presence of a light being or teacher from another dimension




LESSON 6: Hemi-Sync Meditations for Meditation and Kundalini

Certainly, the integration of Hemi-Sync Meditations further augments the
transformative potential of the awakening process, providing a supportive framework
for stabilizing the energy field and facilitating a seamless progression along the path
of spiritual evolution. These meticulously crafted meditative compositions, perfectly
attuned to the harmonious frequencies of 432 Hz Solfeggio tones, serve as a potent
catalyst for aligning the body, mind, and spirit with the natural rhythms of the
universe, fostering a state of profound coherence and resonance with the divine
energies permeating the cosmos.



By immersing oneself in the immersive experience of Hemi-Sync Meditations,
practitioners can cultivate a deep sense of inner harmony, tranquility, and balance,
harnessing the transformative power of sound and vibration to amplify the effects of
meditation and breathwork. The resonant frequencies embedded within each
composition create a synergistic interplay of energy, guiding participants on an
experiential journey that transcends the boundaries of the physical realm and unlocks
the hidden potential of the subconscious mind. As the gentle waves of sound envelop
the consciousness, a profound sense of serenity and peace pervades the being,
allowing for a seamless integration of the awakened Kundalini Energy and the
harmonizing influence of Metatron's Cube within the energetic field.



Moreover, the inherent properties of Solfeggio frequencies further enhance the
transformative potential of Hemi-Sync Meditations, fostering a deeper connection
with the natural flow of cosmic energy and facilitating a profound alignment with the
vibrational essence of the universe. The intrinsic resonance of these harmonious
frequencies instills a sense of tranquility, balance, and unity within the energetic field,
allowing practitioners to attune themselves to the natural rhythms of creation and
unlock the latent potential of their consciousness. As the journey towards self-
realization unfolds, the integration of Hemi-Sync Meditations serves as a guiding
light, illuminating the path towards spiritual enlightenment and facilitating a seamless
integration of the awakened Kundalini Energy into the fabric of one's being.
In essence, the harmonious fusion of meditation, Metatron's Cube, and Hemi-Sync
Meditations creates a transformative synergy of energy, offering a comprehensive
framework for spiritual growth, self-discovery, and divine realization.




CHAPTER 4: SACRED GEOMETRY MEDITATION

LESSON1: FORMLESS GEOMETRY MEDITATION / OPEN EYE MEDITATION

Formless Geometry Meditation / Open Eye Meditation


Finally! You have reached the meditation. Thank you from the bottom of my
heart for reading everything up to here.


Since the idea for this project came to me while meditating, I dedicate this part to
Archangel Metatron, who has accompanied me until today and contributed a lot
to this meditation. Archangel Metatron and the Metatron Cube are really all in
one - infinite knowledge.


I will now explain the process of meditation to you and then explain individual
steps in more detail below - even though the motto is: Follow your intuition, let
yourself be guided. Trust yourself


The Meditation


Since I assume that you already own one of these wonderful Formless Prints or
have a printed picture of Metatron's Cube, I ask you to place the artwork in front
of you and place the sacred geometric symbol - be it the Metatron's Cube, the
Flower of Life or the Merkaba - at eye level. Please light a small candle and
preferably turn off all lights and electronic devices. You should tune in
completely to the sacred geometric symbol, concentrate and perceive the
energy. Of course, the right meditation music is also important. Feel free to put
on your favorite meditation music so that you can completely relax.
You can sit on your meditation cushion, on a chair, cross-legged, etc. - just as you
feel most comfortable and not disturbed. The only important thing is that you
can see the Sacred Geometric Symbol and are not sitting too far away. I think a
little more than an arm's length is perfect. Now that the framework is settled,
here comes the main part.


- If you are initiated into the system of Sacred Geometry Metatron's
Cube, ask for energy from the energy system and Archangel Metatron
beforehand -.




1. Now let yourself go for about 7-10 minutes - with open eyes - to the energy of
Sacred Geometry - look exactly into the center of the form. During this Time once
again ask for the energy and wisdom of Sacred Geometry. It is important that
you breathe calmly & rhythmically so that you begin to relax even with your eyes
open. I recommend you: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe
out for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds - breathe only through your nose. You try
to keep this up the whole time. After a while you will have found a rhythm that
feels natural. You will notice that your perception or field of vision darkens and
you slowly begin to block everything out. The infinite shapes in Metatron's cube
will fascinate you and put you in a trance. Try to maintain this state until it feels
right to close your eyes.


2. Your eyes should now be closed. Imagine the symbol in your mind's eye - at
least as big (high and wide) as your body. Try to let this loving, powerful, beautiful
energy work and perceive it. Let the symbol appear fully and manifest it crystal
clear in front of you - even if you are not so good at visualizing at first. Make sure
that the intention and thought, the energy and/or the symbol appear before your
inner eye. Everything is energy and so is your mind.


3. Now please imagine that the symbol passes through you from the front and
then from the back to the front again. Then you let the symbol move through
you from the bottom to the top and then again from the top to the bottom. Now
the symbol moves through you from left to right and back again (from right to
left). Try to make a little game out of it and be creative. If you want to make it
even more intense, try to imagine it on several levels at once, moving through
you from top to bottom, left to right, and back again. But know. If you can't
visualize that well yet, intention is enough. Try to synchronize the movements
with your breathing. So when it goes from front to back - inhale - and when it
goes back - exhale. After some time the symbol stops in your center. It is inside
you and outside of you, surrounding you completely. Let the whole energy work
on you. Let go of your thoughts and become FORMLESS. Free from thoughts.
4. To strengthen and consolidate the energy, let it flow into you with your
breathing. Imagine how your energy and the energy of sacred geometry flows
from your crown chakra to the left - exhale. Then, at/below your feet or your root
chakra, it flows to the right - a short holding of the breath, as it were - and up
again on the right side - inhale. When you reach your head, the energy flows
back down the body to the left - exhale. Repeat this process at least 7 times.
Then do the same, except that the energy now flows forward from your crown
chakra - exhale. Back under the feet or to the root chakra to the back - hold your
breath for a moment- up the spine - inhale. When you reach the top, it shoots
down your forehead again from the front. Repeat this process 7 more times.
After that you can try to do both at the same time. Left - Right; Front - Back.




5. After you have circulated the energy, you can let it rise into your crown chakra
and let it flow out there. While doing this, you can imagine how a certain color
surrounds you, because you can also concentrate on a certain theme if you
master this technique. You will find the meaning of the different colors and
chakras in the following chapter. Let this energy of the color tune you in and
energize you as well. You can also stay with the color white or no color at all and
concentrate on the meditation and your affirmations.

For advanced users:
You can now try to breathe into each chakra, imagining the respective colors. It's
best to start with the root chakra and work your way up to the crown chakra.
Inhale 7 times into each chakra and visualize the corresponding color.
Affirmation should be enough for the beginning. You can find all the Affirmations
in the next chapter.
6. Now you can let go. If you have certain questions, the answers can come to
you now. You may also just want to come into this space of silence, wisdom and
healing to experience it and perceive that it is there. There can be an inner
dialogue with the divine / with yourself of with other wonderful energies around
you. This is very important, because I invite you to be more in touch with you and
your body. He is listening to you! The important thing in this part is that you also
start sending out positive thoughts, intentions and feelings in this harmony. I
have written down for you the best affirmations and feelings. These can also be
in harmony with the colors from before. You can also find more information in
the following chapters.

In this case you can also use the SAFE technique. You will notice that this also
goes beyond the meditation later and finds application. "How does it feel to be
brave?" - Let thoughts and feelings of fearlessness and courage arise "How does
it feel to bathe in perfect love?" - Let loving thoughts and perfect love flow into
you - you'll also find lots of positive food for thought in the rest of this chapter. I
know it sounds ridiculous to talk to yourself and let these thoughts and feelings
come into you, and maybe it feels a little played at first. But believe me, the more
often you say these positive thought patterns to yourself, the more meaning and
emotion you give to these thoughts and intentions, the stronger you will feel. "I
AM" Affirmations, which you will also find in the next chapter, are also very
helpful. You just have to stay with it. Because your thoughts and your mind
control your reality and your feelings. Yes, you may even smile during the whole
meditation, at least it always happens to me. This part can take 10-30 minutes,
just let yourself be guided.


7. At the end of your ritual, thank this energy and Sacred Geometry and slowly
come back to yourself with a deep breath.


8. Open your eyes and place your hands on your heart - the right hand on the
left - and FEEL THE PERFECT LOVE AND THANKFULNESS. Meanwhile, look at the
picture and perceive love, realization and transformation.


9. Take another deep breath, stretch and come back to yourself fully. Stay with
pleasure for a moment in this deep gratitude and love.


And that was the whole meditation. I'm curious what you think of it. I'm
convinced that if you integrate this routine into your life, your life can change 180
degrees.
Lesson2: Colors, Chakra & Affirmations

Integration of individual sublevels


Now I'll explain the two small sub-practices I've incorporated into the meditation.
Surely some practices remind you of something you already know, but they are
still very effective. The more you get used to this kind of meditation, the easier it
will be for you to integrate these parts. You might also let yourself be guided
intuitively, so that you add your own touch to the meditation.



Colors, Chakras & Affirmations

You are welcome to choose the affirmations that you like best at the moment.
Trust your intuition. So that it does not become too much, I recommend you to
choose a maximum of 3 Affirmations per chakra. It is also perfectly fine to
choose only one Affirmation.


These are all topics related to these chakras and colors. It is not necessary to
work with colors and chakras in meditation, but it always proves to be a useful
tool to know yourself better.



LESSON 3: SAFE technique
SAFE Technique



A small digression about SAFE must not be missing. I think that this method is
addressed and taught in almost all spiritual teachings. Everyone has his own
interpretation and approach to this technique. I think that the more often you
come into contact with this method, the more you should become aware of the
meaning, what positive influence it can have on you.


Basically, there are 4 sub-aspects involved.


SEE:

Crystal clear visualization in meditation. If you want to go one step further, turn
off your doubts and visualize in all detail what you desire. For "Thy will be done."
Everything is built on this one thought and you have to nourish it positively.


ACT:

Setting intentions and thoughts, being YOURSELF - behaving and accepting
yourself as you are and using the energy from the Affirmations and belief sets to
actually act and integrate into everyday life.


FEEL:

Integrate higher feelings (joy, fun, wholeness, love) into everyday life and
meditation. This includes being grateful for everything. We take everything too
much for granted these days and have forgotten to be grateful for the little
things. We have also forgotten to practice love, wholeness and joy for ourselves
and life. Just acting out of yourself with these feelings has a great impact on your
life and reality. I don't mean that you now go up to everyone on the street and
say "I love you". It's about rediscovering that deep love, that deep understanding,
that deep gratitude for everything that is. Then you automatically act with the
infinite, wonderful, creative power of so-called love. It is not the same kind of
love as when I say to a loved one, "I love you" or "I love you." This so-called love
goes far beyondthat. It is in unity and wholeness. It is the alchemical marriage of
themasculine and feminine aspects within you.


ENERGIZE:
This is the part of energizing action. Both internally and externally through
meditation, self-love, sports (yoga, chi gong, Breathwork, etc.). The study of
ancient mystical knowledge, such as the Hermetic Laws, the Spiritual Laws, the
ancient Egyptian Mysteries, Metaphysics, and much more. One comment I have
already made was about Rudolf Steiner's 6 subsidiary exercises. These are also
part of this section here and are a wonderful companion. There are things you
have to do both in the waking state and in the deep trance of meditation to
change your life.

It takes work and commitment. Just meditating and sitting around won't do
anything, but if you put the knowledge to work for you and start believing in it,
you can change your life. Be aware that the universe/your soul will always initiate
things for you if you just keep your eye on the ball and don't always doubt and
fear. Because anxiety, fear, doubt, negative thoughts prevent and hinder all
positive thoughts sent out and put your "manifestation" on hold. You must begin
to banish all negative beliefs from your life and stop identifying with them. You
are only incarnated in this body to gain experience and learn. But that is exactly
what is wonderful.

You are the creator of your own reality and you are responsible for everything.
So finally take the helm and responsibility for everything that happens in your
life. Accept it and let go. You are worth so much more and I want you to realize
that NOW. Start loving life and stop seeing only negative things everywhere and
instead ask yourself what exactly those negative things are trying to tell you.

Most of the time, the signals are clues for you to finally take a different path and
recognize and accept the abundance in your life.



Numerology of the Name

One last thought about this method in connection with number mysticism is also
quite interesting.

The number 13 stands for the "spiritual death" and you should not be afraid of it
at all. It only stands for the new beginning and the Matrix itself (M=13th letter).
Your new beginning, when you finally break away from the old and reinvent
yourself - find your spiritual origin again.

If you interpret the word "SAFE" with numerology and divide the letters into the
corresponding numbers, you get S=1, A=1, F=6, E=5. That adds up to 13 as a big
number and breaks down again to a 4. Both numbers are most interesting. It
should be noted that I have calculated the numerological meaning only at a later
time and the name came to me once again while meditating. As you can see,
meditation simply plays a big role and should always be integrated into the daily
routine.

The 13, as already mentioned, stands for the new beginning - your new
beginning. This method gives you the opportunity to break up old structures. At
least I can say that for myself. I unconsciously followed this method and am now
exactly where I am. I take my life into my own hands and want to create
something better for myself and humanity.


The number 4 forms and symbolizes the foundation stone - on which you want
to build your life. This should be strong and indestructible and can also be
equated with your positive thought patterns (thought programs) and
affirmations. Because your thoughts determine everything. How you feel, what
you create and how you experience your reality.



CHAPTER 5: FURTER PRACTICES

Lesson1: 21 Days Affirmation Technique

21 Days Affirmation Technique

In this chapter I would like to introduce an Affirmation technique and how you
can integrate it into your everyday life and meditations. Among other things, in
the next chapter you will also find a list of some Affirmations that you can use. I
think you will just feel which one you need right now to clear old negative
thought patterns.


We all know the name Nikola Tesla. A genius on his own, right? There are many
people to whom his work should mean something. I don't want to go into more
detail about Tesla here, but I would like to thank him for his work. He was very
aware of the universe and the spiritual world and realized that our life and what
we see goes beyond physical reality.


He once said "If you knew about the magnificence of the numbers 3, 6 and 9,
you would have the key to the universe."

Certainly there are very, very many meanings for these numbers and many
attempts have been made to interpret this quote. But that's not really what I
want to talk about here, I just want to use the energy of these numbers. Energy,
frequency and vibration play a big role. This is what creates thoughts and words -
energy, frequency and vibration. Since we are electromagnetic beings,
frequencies and vibrations have a tremendous influence on us and that is why it
is important to repeat Affirmations not only in our thoughts but also out loud.
Because your body must also finally understand that it is time to let go of this
false image and identification that your negatively programmed thought
patterns, body cells and feelings are trying to instill in you and keep you stuck in
the illusion of a "comfort zone". As you know, true life and true beauty lies
outside of it.


The 21-Day Affirmations Technique


This is exactly where the numbers 3-6-9 find their application. It is actually quite
simple and yet it has such a great impact on your subconscious. You choose a set
of affirmations that fit the theme that seems important to you. It can be quite
general for starters. This is how I did it.

Here is an example of the Affirmations I started with and this already almost
belongs to my POWER-Affirmations:


• I AM surrounded and full of infinite love, omniscience and
gratitude.
• I AM and receive abundance, wealth and success.
• I AM the creator of my reality; I AM Divine.
• I AM confident, strong, and expressive.
• I AM always safe and protected.
• I AM a pillar of light for humanity.


I AM a magnet and attract gratitude, love, abundance, success, wealth,
selfconfidence, courage, protection, blessings, omniscience, money, the mystical
and health into my life.


Let's say you take 13 affirmations or affirmation words that you want to include.
So now you take these Affirmations and repeat them in the following rhythm.


For 7 days 3x a day. Then another 7 days 6 times a day and after that another 7
days 9 times a day - a total number of 21 days. This will rewrite your Negative
Thought Programs and negative beliefs in your subconscious mind.


The important thing is that when you recite these intentions, you try to put in as
much truth, honesty and love as possible. Associating the right feelings to these
intentions is the key. It may feel rather dull at first, but you will soon realize that
these words reflect your reality and true feelings. It is very important that you
stand in front of a mirror and look at yourself. Because with that you can put a
smile on your face and believe me, it'sreally fun. Just love yourself a little bit
more. That's how you can create love for yourself.


You can also follow your intuition and extend the period. Make positive thinking
and affirmations a daily routine for your whole life. It's just very important to
remember this every day. Believe me. We humans are creatures of habit. So
make this routine your habit until you want to do it every day all by itself. I can't
imagine my life without this routine and I wouldn't want to be without it. And be
sure, the motivation is there in the beginning, but what keeps that motivation
going is your discipline and will! Stay strong, you are a wonderful person and you
deserve it!



Routine reinforcement

To strengthen this routine, truly embrace the Affirmations and initiate success in
this endeavor, you can try using the 3 phases of the 21-Day Cycle for yourself.


These are as follows:


1. From the silence; The beginning
2. The way; transformation
3. Retreat, the goal; The consolidation


Basically, you take the above principle and try to anchor this Affirmation so
deeply that your muscles, tendons, bones, organs, cells and everything else in
your body can feel these Affirmations as true and transformation can occur.
Then these words can become YOU. Just as many people do it daily with negative
beliefs and this becomes their reality, you can make it happen with positive
beliefs.


From silence; The beginning - 21 days
This phase is the part described above. You choose one set of Affirmations and
continue with the method for 21 days. 7 days 3x a day, 7 days 6x a day and 7
days 9x a day.


The path; transformation - 21 days

Here, too, it remains mainly the same. Here you will only recite the Affirmations
2x for 21 days.


Retreat, the goal; The consolidation - 21 days

In this phase you repeat the Affirmations 1x a day for 21 days. After a total of 63
days, you could now start over and choose a new set of Affirmations.


For the future:

You can also extend this technique by choosing a set of 7 or 13
POWERAffirmations to recite every morning after your meditation, and then
continue with the 21-day technique. This way you have a constant and a variable
for continuous growth.


So your POWER Affirmation could also consist of 13 important I AM Affirmations
such as:


I AM:
1. THANKFUL
2. LOVE
3. FULL
40
4. WHOLE
5. PERFECT
6. SUCCESSFUL
7. SELF-CONSCIOUS
8. MUTIG
9. STRONG
10. POWERFUL
11. HARMONIC
12. HAPPY
13. HEALTHY
Lesson2: Affirmation Examples

Now here is a big list of very many negative thought patterns, programs and
Affirmations that we can carry within us and what positive counterpart we
should work with instead.
These are just a few of probably thousands of thoughts that can run through
your head and make your life difficult. You just have to always remember that
there is a way out of every situation and every thought. In this case, I will very
briefly discuss one of Rudolf Steiner's subsidiary exercises, which certainly fits
well with the Affirmations.


One of his exercises is called: Impartiality/Positivity

This includes seeing the good and the positive in a situation. That is, the quality
of recognizing the good in all things. An old Persian story about Jesus tells that he
saw a dying, already decaying dog on the side of the road. Jesus stopped and
looked at the animal, while all the bystanders turned away in disgust. But Jesus
said, "What beautiful teeth this animal has! He does not see evil, but good. As
banal as this may sound. There is no reason to always see only the negative in
everything. The gift of life was certainly not given to us so that we would always
complain and talk badly about everything. When we are in that spirit, we look for
the good that is everywhere and in everything. Both the etheric and physical
bodies are greatly affected by this.

Affirmations can therefore help to refocus our minds on the good and positive,
so that we learn to deal with the negative. As you already know, we are here to
learn and not to sink into negativity and sadness. Accept this state and let it go.
You don't have to identify with it anymore.
CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSION

LESSON1: FAREWELL

Finally, I would like to thank you once again for finishing my course. I hope that
the course has given you some new food for thought and that this meditation
will now accompany you on your path. This is the first course I have ever written
and I am always open to criticism, thoughts or further suggestions to improve
something or even as an incentive to write a new course.


My only goal is to inspire you and if possible all people on this planet and to
rekindle this spark of LOVE in you. I cannot help every person and not every
person wants to be helped, but whoever seeks help and asks, I accept him with
open arms. He will also easily find me, I believe that with every cell of my body. I
know that sometimes it is not easy, but you must always remember that you
have chosen this life and this path. If you ask for help, be it God/the
Universe/Source or your guardian angel, you will be helped. Just try to let go of
the "how will it happen" and just let it happen. These things will be sorted out
and adjusted for you in the background. Stand up, love, smile and open yourself
to life. That is all that is asked of you. Accept the anxiety and fear, because these
states/feelings are just toys that keep you from real life and just let them go, let
yourself be guided and trust.


In the next chapter I have a few more book recommendations for you. These
books have helped me a lot and contributed to the fact that my life, my beliefs
have changed and I could open myself completely for love. Because love and
wholeness is the power of the universe, the language of God and the highest
frequency there is. It is simply a process of getting back into that vibration. Let
yourself fall and be guided and understand that in the future you can walk in
harmony with your free will, guidance and intuition if that is what you want.

LESSON2: BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS

   1.   Dr Joe Dispenza - Become supernatural
   2.   The Kabalyion
   3.   One Truth, One Law: I AM, I Create
   4.   Walter Russel - The Universal One - for very advanced and physics
        interested people
   5.   Dolores Cannon - Between Death and Life and Convoluted Universe
        Books
   6.   The Emerald Tablets - Billy Carlson
   7.   Deepak Chopra - Quantum Healing
   8.   Spotify Podacst: Ozark Mountain Transformation Conference
   9.   Tricia McCannon - Return of the Divine Sophia
   10. The Book of Wisdom - Revival of Wisdom
   11. The Hearth Book



These are a few books that have supported and accompanied me on my way. If one of these
books has aroused your interest, then nothing stands in the way of buying it and diving
further into the wonderful world of esotericism and metaphysics. The order says nothing
about the value or importance. Here the first task is to rely on your intuition and choose one.
It is important to feed your mind with such knowledge so that your state of mind keeps
improving and you can keep growing. It is very important on your life's journey to relearn
and remember some things that have been lost. I wish you continued success, much love
and much joy on your way!




Lesson 3: Metatron’s Cube Picture Download

BONUS: TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL!

LESSON1: Initiation into the Sacred Geometry System "Metatron's Cube"

Since it is my heart's desire to accompany and help you, I naturally have more to
offer than just this course, namely the initiation into the "System of Sacred
Geometry Metatron's Cube".


I think books and courses are the perfect introduction and extremely important
for acquiring knowledge and being able to understand certain things. I'm not the
type who likes to say, "Here's a shortcut, there's a shortcut." I think it's very
important to gain experience, because that's what we're here for. You can do this
through different aspects: reading, meditation, people, lectures, videos, and
more. But remember that everything matters and not just one single thing. I fell
in love with reading books very late in life, and often these books can give you
knowledge that no human can give you. Meditations where you can explore this
knowledge often give you more to take with you than you thought. In this fast-
paced time, it is essential to come to rest and connect with the source.

Read, meditate, receive. Only when you look inside yourself and start asking
questions, you will get answers. Even though, strangely enough, your higher self
keeps offering and sending you messages, answers and help [21:11 (111) on the
clock as I write this sentence], we often ignore it as a coincidence, a figment of
our imagination, or don't even notice it. But that's okay. We are here to learn and
evolve.
This happens through many different things. This means all levels. Both on the
energetic/spiritual level and on the physical level. But in order to receive or
understand new information, we have to take certain steps. Be it changing
beliefs, learning new knowledge through reading or seminars/lectures, changing
feelings or meditating. But that is a book in itself and a whole other topic.

What I'm saying is that there are things that can help you make this path a little
more beautiful and can greatly help you just see life more easily. In this case, for
example, learning an energetic healing system and getting initiated, or learning
new physical systems like yoga or chi gong - just 2 things to enumerate. On my
page [LINK] you will find the initiation that inspired me to write this course. This
initiation does not require a Reiki degree or anything else. It is a wonderful tool
to work with this course and the meditation that goes with it and to open up
further to this realm.

This system is called the "System of Sacred Geometry Metatron's Cube". Through
this system I have already been given countless ideas and thoughts. I would like
to pass on this knowledge and this energy very much and enrich your life with it.
If this has aroused your interest, please visit my website and book initial
consultation. This is especially important to me, so that you get a face and a
feeling of me on the one hand and I can get to know you better on the other.
Who knows what will develop from this conversation and where this path will
lead us. I also just appreciate having an open, loving, relaxed conversation with
you. I just want to be a support to people and help them to more love, freedom,
wholeness and joy.

I am only human, just like you. The point is that we all pull together and help
each other and give love.

I am glad to meet you.



System briefly summarized

All information can also be found on my site.

What is the "System of Sacred Geometry Metatron's Cube" and why
should I get initiated?


In short, the "System of Sacred Geometry Metatron's Cube" is a system for any
person who would like to work more intensively with the energy of Archangel
Metatron and Metatron's Cube. A person who also likes to meditate and grow in
the field of mysticism, sacred geometry and metaphysics.
Meditation also plays an important part here.
The energy system and meditation are among the most effective and rapid
systems of spiritual development available to us today. Yet it is largely neglected.
It is incredibly simple to understand and contains many of the most complex and
best kept esoteric mysteries of the cosmos and creation.


I know it can help you to go one step further. As I said, we should study and work
with every aspect of life. Therefore, I am confident that it can take you to a higher
level and you can use this system for your spiritual growth.

LESSON2: What are Formless Prints?

What are Formless Prints?



Formless Prints are works of art that use the power and energy of sacred
geometry to reflect the essence of the beauty of the universe and transform it
into a unique design.

Another unique feature of Formless Prints is the combination of art and
spirituality. Each print has been carefully designed to convey a message and
energy that can help expand consciousness, promote spiritual well-being, and
create a deeper understanding of the world around us. Whether it's a depiction
of the flower of life or a complex geometric pattern, each Formless Print is
unique and intriguing - you'll learn much more about that in the next section!

These images are more than just works of art, they are part of a larger vision to
spread the beauty, energy and power of sacred geometry around the world.
LESSON3: Why Formless Prints?

Why Formless Prints?



Formless Prints are not only there to transform your space (living room,
bedroom, bathroom, study) into a paradise. They also support your mental well-
being, light body process and spirit. They are the perfect way to let more light
and love into your life again and to always remember that you are a spark of God
- a part of the Source - always in connection with your Higher Self and with help
from the realm of the Spirit World.


Formless Prints are also the perfect way to finally take your meditation to a new,
unimagined level that you've never experienced before. I can only recommend
you to integrate all these possibilities into your life. You simply deserve to live a
life full of abundance, love, wholeness, joy, happiness, success and freedom. The
Universe/God/Source/Your Higher Self is always trying to offer you as many
possibilities and opportunities as possible and I ask you to listen to it.


In conjunction with Sacred Geometry, these works of art simply have a long
lasting effect on you and the room in which they hang. Sacred geometry is said
to:


• Strengthen connection to the divine origin/source/God/soul/your higher
self
• Bring harmony, balance and harmony (mind, body, soul)
• Clean the room and protect it from negative energy
• Be able to trigger inner transformation
• Always remind you that you are loved and protected
• Give you infinite strength, energy and the infinite divine
power(love)
• Remind yourself of your higher purpose
• Put you in touch with the spirit world
• Support you in the light body process, which is very important at the
moment
• And much more.


And that's exactly what went through my mind one day during a meditation:

"How can I manage to help as many people as possible to help?"
From this came the idea of Formless Print and this project. I want to share this
wonderful energy and power with everyone on earth. It is really infinitely
important to me that we can all live a positive, free, wonderful, loving and self
determined life. For this to happen, one very important factor must be in place.
Before our and your life can change on the outside, exactly what has to happen?
That's right! Your connection to your Higher Self/God/Source/Universe must be
restored.

This means:


• Your inner compass needs to be realigned
• The masculine and feminine in you must come into harmony again
• Harmony and unison must enter your life
• You need to go within yourself and reconnect with your divine spark
• Surround and connect yourself with this primal
source/divinity/beauty every day
• Meditate with a reason and a new attitude
• Finally remove your negative beliefs from your life
• Completely reprogram your mind
• Become mindful and aware
• Get your thoughts under control


Only how is this supposed to work now?

There are many ways to achieve this and I think we should combine them all. I
certainly don't have all the solutions, but I know that this project can make an
enormous contribution so that many people wake up again and become aware
of this presence - so that simply more love is shared and experienced in this
world again. I am not trying to convince anyone. I am trying to write this book
with an open and honest heart and simply trying to touch a part of you that has
been waiting for a long time.

With these artworks and many projects still to come, I simply want to help you
find yourself again. I know that through inner work, meditation, the right attitude
and meaningful "work" mountains can be moved. Every person in this world truly
deserves to be a part of this movement and everyone has a right to this
knowledge - this wonderful magic. Because this knowledge was lost a very, very
long time ago and is slowly coming back to the surface.

And as you have heard everywhere, we have to look for this answer within
ourselves. Our Higher Self / Soul and we can connect to the infinite knowledge
(we are constantly connected to it). We just need to access it again and learn. We
must finally become aware again that we are all a beautiful divine energy just
waiting to be heard again.

I know that in today's world money, work and security play a big role and that
this must be guaranteed at all times. Nevertheless, we should take time every
day to get in touch with the source. Because nothing comes from nothing. Before
this whole idea, project and courage to change my life NOW came to me, I
meditated every day for 3 months 2-3 times - each meditation 45-60 minutes -
did sports and changed my diet. To do this I was at work 5 days a week for 9
hours. EVERY one of us - YES also YOU - has the possibility to change his life and
reality.

You only need to be aware of one very simple thing:


Your thoughts determine your reality


However, many thoughts are formed by physical and emotional reactions and
are often negative. Therefore, we need to achieve this mental strength to make a
small part of all Universal Laws like the "Law of Attraction" work. I don't want to
discourage you, but I want to tell you that it is actually quite simple. Meditation
with a focus and a goal can change your life. I am the best example of this. I was
able to erase so many negative programs from my subconscious mind.

I owe that to my passion for meditation. The only thing that matters is that you
acquire new habits, stay on the ball and finally have more fun in life.

How was the universe created? Through the Big Bang? Where does it come from?
- In spirituality and occult teachings there is a very important law. In the case of
the Hermetic Laws:


The principle of mentalism - The law of mentalism


Simply put, this law states that your thoughts shape your individual reality. All
your previously manifested thoughts have led to what is today. Consequently,
the Law of Spirituality also states that your thoughts (often what is hidden inside
- who you think you are) determine your external circumstances and not the
other way around. Your state of mind shapes your life and is the creator of your
reality. The more intense your thoughts and the associated emotions, the greater
the result - your thoughts manifest.

Everything begins in the mind. Everything is based on energy.
Spirit = energy; love = energy; matter = energy


Everything is interconnected and our universe was created by a single thought
and is simply perfect. Do not strive for perfection, because you yourself are
individual, uniquely perfect - you are you. That's how I think and that's how many
others think.


That's why you need to start taking your thoughts seriously. Start controlling
your thoughts and becoming the master of your feelings. One of my favorite
authors Dr. Joe Dispenza always says: "How you think and how you feel creates
your reality" - something like this. It means that you create your reality through
how you think and how you feel.


Rudolf Steiner is also a great help. He was a genius of his time and contributed a
great deal to mind training. It makes a lot of sense to integrate the 6 subsidiary
exercises into your life.


The six stages of these subsidiary exercises are as follows:


• the first level: mind control
• the second stage: initiative of actions
• the third stage: overcoming lust and envy
• the fourth stage: positivity
• the fifth level: impartiality
• the sixth stage: harmony of the five stages


If you want to learn more about it, you can follow this link:
[https://anthrowiki.at/Neben%C3%BCbungen]


To make it short, in the whole last time - now it is almost 12 months - I have
made exactly these steps without being aware of it. Day after day! So if you just
start listening to your intuition, miracles can happen. Apparently, your Higher
Self always knows what's best for you, if you start listening to that inner voice
and following it.



It is very important to me that you finally start to take your life into your own
hands and become a creator. In the next chapter we will finally get to meditation
and other practices that can help you transform your life like an alchemist.
Looking forward to it!



Lesson3: How to use the Initiation & Meditation

Meditation

Metatron is one with the One and you can transcend duality by resonating with
his energy and reclaim your light body abilities. This is a positive feature of
meditation from my course. It can be compared to many meditation techniques,
but still has its uniqueness.
As a perfect blueprint, you have a special purpose on this planet, which is now
being revealed to you by placing your energy system in the perfection of the
archetypal energies of the Metatron Cube. This happens by looking at Metatron's
cube and by the initiation into the system of Sacred Geometry.



Balance

This work is aimed at restoring the balance between masculine and feminine
energy, since the imbalance between these energies is the main problem
affecting human beings and our planet.
The suppression of female energy has caused us to be out of balance. However,
it is not possible to eliminate one part of the equation of creation and expect
revelation at the same time. Through this meditation, the balance between the
male and female poles of the body is restored.
