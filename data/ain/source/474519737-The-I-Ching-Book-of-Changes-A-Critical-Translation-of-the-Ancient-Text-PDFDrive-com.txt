                     PREFACE



Coming of age in the sixties, I was fascinated by what was
still referred to as the “mysterious Orient,” as well as Western
occultism, itself somewhat beholden to Asian religious and philo-
sophical ideas. At the same time I became attracted to Chinese art,
particularly Song landscape and Shang and Zhou bronzes. Western
interest in China and Japan began far earlier than the sixties. It
started with the early Jesuit missionaries and European philoso-
phers, notably Gottfried Leibniz and Voltaire, who knew about
China only through the accounts of others.
    The sudden rise of interest in Asian religion and philosophy in
the sixties was partly due to media popularization, but also because
the times were hungry for new ideas, particularly for philoso-
phies that might offer something life-changing. Through my own
engagement with Chinese culture this came true for me, though
not entirely in ways I expected. I had limited opportunity to pursue
this interest during the long years I was engaged in the ordeal
of medical training, though I did find time to acquaint myself
with the Dao De Jing in the translation of Gia-fu Feng and Jane
English, a work that helped me through this difficult time. While
my approach to science has always been strictly empirical, I found
that Asian thought offered me something that Western science did
not. It is not that I thought these philosophical traditions were
somehow superior to science, rather, they addressed deep human
concerns that the hard sciences by their nature cannot. For this
reason I have always been impatient with the notion that science
and spirituality are incompatible––humanity needs both.
    I was particularly fascinated by divination, not as a means of
predicting for myself but as an alternative mode of knowledge, one
that many still find of value in their lives. Scientism rejects such as
not empirically verifiable, but neither is the beauty of a painting
verifiable, despite its enhancing life.
x	Preface



   Neither my scientific studies nor my graduate study of
renaissance and later literature spoke to me about the sort of
knowledge-seeking that is the basis of divination and the esoteric
more generally. It was the sixties counter-culture that prompted
a fresh look at these matters, previously rejected as unworthy of
serious attention. I have still not decided if the counter-cultural
movement of the sixties was overall good or bad, but it did open
minds to previously rejected knowledge. Much of this knowledge
was deservedly rejected, but not all.
   One result of my awakening to non-scientific ways of thought
was fascination with the Book of Changes, variously called I
Ching, Yijing, and Zhouyi. Impecunious in my student days,
I deferred buying the omnipresent Wilhelm-Baynes translation,
waiting for it to come out in paperback. It never did, so, once I
was a resident, with the modest affluence of an actual salary, I
made the financial commitment of buying the iconic hardcover
volume. I found it difficult going. During my pre-medicine years as
a graduate student of early English language philology I had often
been frustrated by texts when I could not determine the provenance
of their various components. Like those who avoid Chinese food
because they want to know what they are eating, I need to know
what I am reading. As presented by Wilhelm-Baynes, the text is
best described as a gemisch, a Yiddish term used by biochemists
to refer to a mixture of known and unknowable ingredients.
Interspersed in this masterpiece of book design by the Bollingen
Foundation/Princeton University Press are prolix commentaries
of diverse authorship and date; and sprinkled within these are
bits of the 3,000-year-old Western Zhou text, though mostly
unrecognizable as translated. These commentaries intermingle
more than 2,000 years of reflection on the classic, including the
Ten Wings, composed centuries after the early text, and late Qing
Confucians’ interpretations as passed on to Wilhelm by his tradi-
tionally educated Chinese informant. As if these ingredients were
not enough, Jungian psychology was then slipped in by the English
translator, Cary F. Baynes.
   I was at last able to make progress with the Changes when in
1997 I acquired the immensely learned version of Richard Rutt,
which I began to read on a sunny afternoon in Paris at the Café
de Flore, waiting for my wife to return from a meeting with a
former Sorbonne classmate. I will not say I understood the Book
	Preface	                                                             xi



of Changes on that afternoon but I had a sudden realization that
with enough study the Changes might actually be understood.
It took nearly twenty years from that moment to the translation
you are now reading, but that is about average for translators of
the Changes. Early on, I realized that understanding of this text
is impossible without knowledge of the Chinese language of its
long-ago era. I had long appreciated the aesthetic aspects of the
Chinese writing system and so began a gradual study of the ancient
written language, starting out by learning to write the name of my
wife, Mingmei Yip 葉明媚, and going on from there.
   How I have come to view this classic will be apparent in my
translation. As I suspect is true for many translators of obscure
ancient texts, the deep motivation for undertaking the translation
was to be able to understand it for myself––though also to pass on
the fruit of this immense labor to anyone similarly intrigued by one
of the world’s strangest classics.
   My guiding principle in translating the Zhouyi, the ancient
textual layer of the I Ching, is this: Since it must have made sense
to those who composed it and to its early readers, it should be
possible to translate it so that it makes sense to us. I believe that it
should be mostly understandable to modern readers who have been
given a little background about Western Zhou life. By this I mean
that we should understand the meaning of most phrases, though
the ways of thought will still often seem strange. In translation I
have tried to avoid two extremes: making the text sound contem-
porary, which most existing translations do, or not adequately
resolving obscurities.
   There are many different ways to translate the Book of Changes;
the result depends on one’s assumptions about the nature of the
work and the best way to present it. Although my translation is
quite different from theirs, I need to acknowledge that I could
not have translated at all without extensively consulting the work
of several distinguished scholars of the Zhouyi: Richard Kunst,
Richard Rutt, as already mentioned, and Edward Shaughnessy.
Other versions I have consulted include the works of James Legge,
Wilhelm and Baynes, Gregory Whincup, and Margaret Pearson,
among others.
   It has been said that literary Chinese is so difficult that you
cannot understand it unless you already know what it means.
Paradoxical as this may sound, there is some truth to it, because
xii	Preface



in ancient China the classics were never studied by themselves but
always with teachers and written commentaries that transmitted
earlier understanding of the works. Since such teachers are no
longer among us, I have provided line-by-line commentaries to
explain the ancient text as best I understand it.

                    FOREWORD



This new translation of the I Ching by Geoffrey Redmond stands
out among the many other translations of the 3,000-year-old
classic in several important respects. First, it focuses on the original
meanings, not the later ones overlaid with Confucian moralistic
philosophy (and misogyny). For clarity I have referred to the work
as the I Ching, not the newer pinyin spelling of Yijing. The term
Zhouyi, refers to the earliest version of the Changes which does not
include the centuries-later Ten Wings. The Zhouyi together with
the Ten Wings constitutes the received version, the I Ching.
   As Geoffrey Redmond acknowledges, the well-known Wilhelm-
Baynes translation made the Book of Changes a world classic,
and was an unexpected bestseller. In 1950 Derk Bodde called the
Wilhelm-Baynes translation “the best available in the English-
speaking world.”1 In the ensuing more than sixty years, much has
changed. And yet, for most who start with the Wilhelm-Baynes
translation, the I Ching is astoundingly confusing. Redmond
indicates admiration for its literary qualities, but finds it has only
limited fidelity to the early meanings.
   Based on current scholarship, Geoffrey Redmond offers us a
new translation that is substantially different from that of Wilhelm-
Baynes. Textually speaking, Redmond’s translation follows what
has become standard among Changes scholars—focusing on “the
book of oracles” rather than “the book of wisdom.”2 His translation
is of the core texts, those originally associated with the sixty-four

hexagrams. This allows the early meanings to reveal themselves
as they were (as much as we can tell) without the more than two
millennia of commentary that often altered the classic almost
beyond recognition although, as the title “Ten Wings” implies, the
commentarial materials were supposed to help the I Ching bird to
fly. Unfortunately, they flew it too far away. Redmond began his
study of the Changes years ago with the Wilhelm-Baynes version
but tells us he could never quite grasp the Changes as a product of
Chinese thought. His revelation came when he realized that it had
been possible, beginning with the Doubting Antiquity movement of
early twentieth century China, to reconstruct the early meanings.
    While the work of the Doubting Antiquity philologists greatly
stimulated his interest, he felt they were too often needlessly
obscure. Thinking that if you do not find what you need in an
existing translation you should do your own, he embarked on
this undertaking. His principle is that if people of 3,000 years ago
understood it, it should be possible to make it understandable
today. Readers will have to judge for themselves, but in my
estimation he has succeeded admirably. His approach to attaining
clarity is not to use modern colloquialisms, but to translate each
word precisely into standard English with due consideration of
context. True, there is still much that is strange in his Zhouyi,
but the strangeness is due to the very different way of life of the
Western Zhou, not to eccentric translation.
    In his chapter on the relation of Zhouyi to later Chinese
philosophy, Redmond makes a major contribution to I Ching
scholarship by showing how the Doubting Antiquity scholars went
too far in claiming that the Zhouyi had no spirituality and no
philosophy. As he demonstrates, the work contains what he terms
“seeds” that blossomed in later Chinese philosophy. For example,
he makes it clear that the yin-yang dichotomy was not present in
the Zhouyi but that the dualism of the lines allowed imposition of
the duality of yin and yang.
    For Redmond, the purpose of this reorientation goes beyond
reaffirming the I Ching as a text of the “Bronze Age of China.”3

By emphasizing I Ching’s close connections to a primitive agrarian
setting, Redmond draws our attention to a way of life radically
different from our own. In highlighting the challenges of Chinese
life in the Bronze Age (particularly perpetual violence, constant
threat of disease, and the frequent disruption of social order),
Redmond helps us develop a better understanding of the I Ching
as revealing the hopes and fears of a remote time.
    Today, we may still appreciate the profundity of I Ching
divination, especially its illumination of the complexity and fluidity
of human existence. But we must also guard against our impulse of
idealizing the I Ching as a panacea for our problems in the modern
times. In Wilhelm-Baynes’ translation we see this danger first hand.
Carl Jung, in his foreword, insists that the “synchronicity” of the
I Ching must be contrasted with the scientific “causality” of our
technocratic society.4
    To appreciate how Redmond’s version is different, I need to
explain the ways in which Wilhelm-Baynes muddle the classic.
First, the I Ching is presented in three separate segments.5 It
begins with the sixty-four hexagrams, including the hexagram
names, hexagram images, judgment statements, and line state-
ments. Just as readers have begun to think of the I Ching as a
“book of oracles” giving inquirers illuminating guidance to cope
with the unknown and uncertainty, they come upon two philo-
sophical essays: “Shuokua” (pinyin: Shuogua, Explanations of
the Trigrams) and “Ta Chuan” (pinyin: Dazhuan, The Great
Treatise). In these two essays, readers are asked to stop considering


Zhou dynasties (roughly from 1560 to 221 bce). Although covering a broad period,
Richard Rutt argues that it is beneficial to situate the I Ching in the longue durée of
early China, to fully understand the subtlety of the I Ching text. Rutt pays special
attention to late Shang and the Western Zhou period (roughly from 1000–771 bce)
when the core text of the I Ching was compiled.

  	The Wilhelm-Baynes translation presents the I Ching text in three “books”: Book
One (The Text), Book Two (The Material), and Book Three (The Commentaries).
Note that the Wilhelm-Baynes translation, originally in two volumes, was first
published in 1950 by the Bollingen Foundation. Its second edition (in one volume)
was published by Princeton University Press in 1961 and has been reprinted twenty-
some times.
xvi	Foreword



the hexagrams as oracles and turn their attention to their hidden
meanings. Sharply different from the first part, the second part
presents the hexagrams as metaphors for the constant changes in
the universe and the incessant serendipity in the human world. As
Richard J. Smith elegantly states, the hexagrams become symbols
for “fathoming the cosmos and ordering the world.”6
   Just as the readers begin to develop a taste of the I Ching as a
“book of wisdom” about cosmology and moral-metaphysics, they
find the reappearance of the oracles in part three.7 This time, the
return of the oracles not only reaffirms the I Ching as a divination
manual; it also introduces five additional commentaries: “Tuan”
(Commentary to the Judgments), “Xiang” (Commentary to the
Images), “Wenyan” (Words of the Text), “Xugua” (Hexagrams in
Sequence) and “Zagua” (Hexagrams in Irregular Order). Blurring
the line between text and commentary, materials from these five
distinct appendices are inserted into each chapter as if they are part
of the core text. What was already a complex text now becomes
even more complicated and convoluted.
   Why is the I Ching text so terse, incoherent, and repetitious?
Why are the core text and the commentarial materials not clearly
separated? Would the I Ching be more coherent if it was presented
either as a “book of oracles” (the core text) or a “book of wisdom”
(the commentarial materials)? Should Richard Wilhelm—the
missionary-cum-scholar who translated the I Ching into German
in the 1910s—be blamed for this messy arrangement of the I
Ching text? Or should Cary F. Baynes—the American woman who
rendered Wilhelm’s German translation into English through the
lens of Jungian psychology—be responsible for this jumbled text?
   In fact, neither Wilhelm nor Baynes is culpable. From the time
the I Ching was originally compiled, it has always been a composite
text. As shown in the complex arrangement in the Wilhelm-Baynes

translation, there are three distinct layers of the I Ching text: the
images of the sixty-four hexagrams, the hexagram and line state-
ments, and a group of early commentarial materials collectively
known as the Ten Wings.8 For readers who focus on the first two
layers, they consider the hexagrams as divinatory tools that help
inquirers to find answers to their questions. For readers who focus
on the Ten Wings, they see the hexagrams as graphic illustrations
of early Chinese cosmology and moral-metaphysics, revealing a
philosophical system that connects the natural and the human
realms. While these two readings are different, they complement
each other in highlighting the complexity and fluidity of human
existence. Throughout imperial China, the I Ching was considered
a Confucian classic precisely because it raised questions about the
human condition. Knowledge of it was tested by the civil service
examinations, and it was frequently quoted by literati officials in
discussions with colleagues and even the emperor.
   Even though, by and large, the Wilhelm-Baynes translation
follows the Confucian interpretation of the classic, it is dated
because of important new scholarship since its 1967 third edition.
With advances in phonetic reconstructions of ancient Chinese
and especially the discovery of excavated texts far closer to the
original composition, our knowledge of the I Ching has been
revolutionized. Redmond incorporates this new information into
his translation. He also emphasizes how recent studies of I Ching
commentaries demonstrate that there had never been a single
universally accepted interpretation of the I Ching in imperial China.
On the contrary, due to its multifarious nature, the I Ching was
read from a wide variety of angles including astrology, cosmology,
geomancy, mantic prognostication, medicine, moral philosophy,
and self-help.9 We now know that Wilhelm’s predilection toward

divided into two parts, the commentarial materials are known collectively as the Ten
Wings: the ten supplemental writings that help the I Ching core text to “fly.” For

Redmond and Tze-ki Hon, Teaching the I Ching (Book of Changes) (Oxford:

the moral-philosophical rendition of the I Ching was based on the
views of the late Qing Dynasty.10
   Secondly, recent archaeological discoveries show that the I Ching
text was not completely stable and its transmission (even after its
canonization) was a lot more circuitous than Wilhelm presented.
Three archaeological findings are particularly noteworthy. One is
the Wangjiatai bamboo-strip manuscript that gives us a glimpse of
another divinatory text, the Gui Zang, which is believed to be older
than the I Ching.11 The other is the Shanghai Museum bamboo-strip
manuscript that shows a different form of early I Ching text.12 The
last one is the Mawangdui silk manuscript that indicates that after
the canonization of the I Ching in 136 bce, there were still variant
I Ching texts with somewhat different sequences of hexagrams and
variants of the hexagram names.13 Together, these archaeological
discoveries challenge the conventional moral-philosophical inter-
pretation of the I Ching­­ on which Wilhelm based his translation.
In particular, they caution us that the original I Ching might not
put as much emphasis on hierarchy, patriarchy, and elitism as later
commentators did.14
   While Redmond focuses our attention on the historicity of
the I Ching, he avoids excessive historicalization. Unlike some
translators who stress the primitiveness of ancient China in order
to show how greatly we (as modern people) have “progressed,”
Redmond reminds us that Chinese life in the Bronze Age, though
often harsh, was not altogether bleak and hopeless. On the

contrary, in a pre-Confucian and pre-imperial society, there
was more equality in genders (e.g. the absence of the yin-yang
dichotomy), more fluidity in movement (e.g. the constant joy as
well as danger in climbing a mountain or crossing a river). For
decision-making the Zhouyi was there as a guide, not only for
earthly matters but also for alleviating anxieties about propiti-
ating vengeful spirits.
    Certainly life was tough in early China. In a farming community,
one had to constantly work to make ends meet. In a suste-
nance economy, maintaining health was extremely difficult––all
were constantly surrounded by sick animals, poisonous weeds,
and tainted food. Nevertheless, Redmond demonstrates that
the divinatory responses recorded in each I Ching hexagram––
auspicious or inauspicious, hopeful or downtrodden, uplifting or
depressing––we find both the constancy of change in human life
and the human determination to make the best of it. Although
these core ideas of the I Ching are usually presented in mundane
circumstances (such as family reunion, hunting, marriage, making
preparation for war, skinning animals), they led to the seemingly
more profound philosophy of the Ten Wings and later commen-
taries. After all, the sixty-four hexagrams are thought to be records
of seeking guidance from a deity or an ancestor’s spirit to solve
problems at hand. They are, in essence, concrete examples of
someone creatively responding to the circumstances and earnestly
looking for ways to make a better life.
    In terms of fidelity to the original Chinese version, Redmond’s
translation clearly supersedes Wilhelm-Baynes’ translation and
is a major new chapter in the transmission of the I Ching. First
and foremost, the confusing textual body of the I Ching is now
given a more manageable form where the core text is presented by
itself with the removal of millennia of encrustations that obscure
the early meanings. This foregrounds the divinatory function,
presenting it as it was first used in China, not as re-invented with
Jungian psychology. As modern readers, we can draw on this fresh
version to better appreciate the fluidity and complexity of human
existence since the dawn of civilization.
    Unlike the Wilhelm-Baynes version, Redmond’s does not ask us
to imagine an exotic “East” to critique a supposedly technocratic
“West.” Rather, it offers us an I Ching that is a “book of everyday
life,” used three thousand years ago and still today to look more
xx	Foreword



deeply into the challenges of our daily lives. For casual reading,
Wilhelm-Baynes is satisfactory, but for those who really want
to know the I Ching, Redmond’s translation with his extremely
helpful commentaries is the place to begin.

My editor, Colleen Coalter was enthusiastic about the project from
the beginning, appreciating its challenges, and helping me stay
inspired. Her suggestions resulted in a much better book, particu-
larly adding philosophy to the analysis. She was also patient with
a string of now resolved personal mishaps that slowed my progress
at times.
   Without the knowledge and encouragement of my good friend
and collaborator, Hon Tze-ki, this book would not have come to
pass. My many hours of discussion with him have always been
both pleasurable and educational. I have also benefited from my
membership of the Columbia Early China Seminar, now a part of
the recently founded Tang Center at that university.
   For everyone working on the Zhouyi the foundational works
of Richard Kunst, Richard Rutt, Edward Shaughnessy, Richard
J. Smith, Joseph Adler, and Gregory Whincup are essential. The
work of independent scholar Bradford Hatcher provided me a
provocative counterpoint to standard views.
   Others with whom I have discussed matters related to early
China, and/or whose books I have read and lectures attended
include Sarah Allan, Constance Cook, Catherine Despeux, Li Feng,
Norman Girardot, Paul Goldin, Marc Kalinowski, Ng On-cho,
Michael Nylan, Edward Shaughnessy, Robin Yates, and many
others.
   Such facility as I have for working with difficult texts I owe
especially to my teachers at the University of Virginia, where I
studied early English textual criticism and philology with Lester
Beaurline and Fredson Bowers, “doyen of the post-war” textual
critics according to Eggert [106]. Robert Kellogg’s encouragement
of my youthful work on an extremely obscure Middle English text
gave me confidence when I was finally able to return to literary
study after my long years of medical training. At Riverdale School I
xxii	Acknowledgments



was fortunate to be able to take a two-year course, invitation only,
on the history of philosophy by William Williams. Setting aside
his telling us that Asian philosophy was not worth studying––the
general view among philosophers then and one I am sure he would
not subscribe to now––he said something else that I have kept
in mind ever since: one’s personal opinions are of no interest to
anyone else until you actually know something about your subject.
As a result, I spent over twenty years studying the Book of Changes
before daring to write about it. Finally, I would not know most
of what I now know were it not for my many informal conversa-
tions with my fellow Riverdale student, Christopher Hobson, the
smartest person I have ever met.

                  In memoriam
             The unknown sinologist,
             Richard Rutt (1925–2011)
I think of this distinguished scholar as The Unknown Sinologist
because his ground-breaking work on the Zhouyi has yet to receive
the attention it merits. This epithet is, of course borrowed from
the sobriquet le philosophe inconnu, referring to Louis Claude de
Saint-Martin (1743–1803; a mystical Catholic philosopher, about
whom I know little more than his intriguing nom de plume. As
with the Zhouyi, the unknown has always seemed more interesting
to me than the known, hence my prolonged struggle to translate
the ancient meanings of this 3000-year-old classic.
   The first Western scholars of China who devoted themselves
to this ancient work were a collection of fascinating eccentrics. In
this group are included Rev. Canon McClatchie, who imagined the
Changes was sexy. Also James Legge, laboring tirelessly to create
the earliest accurate English versions of the Chinese classics, despite
the disparagement of these works by his fellow missionaries who
disdained the heathen Chinese classics as obstacles to conversion.
And of course, Richard Wilhelm, a Jungian and missionary who
boasted of never having converted a single Chinese. His collabo-
rator, Cary F. Baynes was the first woman and the first American
to work on the I Ching.
   Father Rutt belongs in this illustrious company of genius-
eccentrics. He learned of the Book of Changes from elderly men
in rural Korea when he was an Anglican missionary there. He
later returned to Britain and became a bishop. After the death of
his wife he became a Roman Catholic priest in protest against the
ordination of women in the Anglican communion. One need not
agree with all his views to appreciate that he was an individualist––
he was flexible enough on gender roles that he took up knitting as
an avocation and wrote the definitive history of it.
   Sadly, Rutt, whom I regard as one of the great China scholars
of the past century, is rarely cited and few sinologists recognize his
name when I mention it. I suspect this is because he spent most
of his life as a churchman rather than an academic. For centuries,
scholars in the West were priests or monks––Rutt was one of the
xxiv	Acknowledgments



last in this lineage. Perhaps because he was an outsider, he had
a unique perspective on the Zhouyi, somewhat antagonistic, yet
saying much that needed to be said. His critical approach brought
the work to life for me, more than the hagiographic rhetoric of the
book’s uncritical admirers.
   Regrettably, I never met the man and know him only through
his invaluable book on the Zhouyi and his obituary. I invariably
find myself in vigorous disagreement whenever I reread passages
in his book, itself a mixture of pointed attacks and painstaking,
meticulous scholarship. Yet every time I browse his work, as I do
quite often, I always feel my understanding has grown. His ideas
are always in my mind when I think about the Zhouyi. Rutt was a
paradox and perhaps that is what one has to be to fully appreciate
the ancient book.
  QUICK START GUIDE
   FOR THE ANCIENT
  BOOK OF CHANGES



Despite its reign in the West during the sixties and seventies as a
hippie scripture, the Book of Changes is far from being an easy read.
It reveals itself more completely to those with some knowledge of
its historical and literary background, hence the detailed supple-
mentary material I have provided. While I believe this material will
greatly enhance the experience of reading the Changes, some may
want to dip into the text to get a taste of it first—this is what I
would do. For eager readers, therefore, I have provided this quick
start guide in the hope that it ameliorates the confusion that is
often the first response to this 3,000-year-old classic.



                       Terminology
Most Anglophones know the book by its old Wade-Giles
Romanization of I Ching, usually mispronounced “eye ching.”
Using the modern pinyin Romanization, standard in the People’s
Republic of China, it is spelled Yijing, and pronounced “eee jing.”
My translation is of the earliest portion of the book consisting
of the sixty-four chapters, each comprising the titles or tags, the
six-line diagrams and the judgment and line texts. This layer is
referred to as the Zhouyi, or Changes of the Zhou. This version
of the title refers back to the dynasty in which it was composed,
the Western Zhou (1046–771 bce). Centuries later a collection of
commentaries was appended, the Ten Wings. These added philo-
sophical and cosmological meanings were not present in the early
xxvi	                  Quick start guide



portion. My translation is based on the ancient meanings, which
were forgotten by the time of the Ten Wings—the actual characters
were basically the same but many of their pronunciations and
meanings had changed. (The exact form of the characters changed,
but they had standard equivalents in newer scripts.)
   The early text, which is what I have translated, consists of
phrases used for divination; the notion of the Changes as a book
of wisdom arose much later, though it has predominated ever
since. With the flowering of evidential and critical scholarship in
China’s late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, scholarly
interest shifted toward textual accuracy and restoration of the
early meanings. In my view, while restoring the ancient meaning,
needless obscurities were introduced. The present translation is
based on my belief that if the text could be understood 3,000 years
ago it can be understood today. Understanding the Zhouyi still
takes effort, but I have tried in this translation to ease the effort
by increasing clarity while remaining true to the text. Mental
stretching will always be needed to put oneself into the mind of
any ancient culture, especially one of a different tradition to one’s
own. I have been studying the Zhouyi for more than two decades,
and hope my labors have succeeded it making more accessible for
my readers.



                    The basic history
The Book of Changes has had three major stages: The Zhouyi,
already mentioned above, was composed about 3,000 years ago
during the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 bce) and was a plain
divination manual based on the primitive conditions of the era.
Several centuries later, possibly during the Spring and Autumn
period (770–503 bce) but certainly by the Warring States period
(ca. 475–221 bce) the text began to be read quite differently, as a
work inculcating Confucian morality and philosophy. A progres-
sively more elaborate metaphysics became associated with it in the
Han Dynasty (202 bce–220 ce). The metaphysical and cosmo-
logical meanings became canonical with the inclusion of the Ten
Wings with the Zhouyi to form the I Ching. Most writings on the
Changes do not distinguish between the ancient concrete meanings
	                       Quick start guide	                         xxvii



and the later metaphysical ones, thus obscuring the actual history
of the classic. With the iconic Wilhelm-Baynes translation, with its
extremely influential Foreword by Carl Jung, the Changes became
a world classic, familiar in the obsolete English spelling of I Ching,
at the price of obscuring its historical development.
   The 3,000-year-old early meanings were forgotten by the time
the Changes attained its status as a classic. Only the Doubting
Antiquity movement, which began circa 1910, by making use of
advances in philology was able to restore the early meanings. This
movement was in part based on the desire to restore China’s past by
demythologizing it, but was also intended to discredit it as the basis
for Chinese society and government, following the humiliations of
the Opium Wars and discovery of Western advanced technology.
Despite this bias, it is because of the textual research initiated by
this movement that we can now come close to reading the Zhouyi
as it was originally written. This also gives us the chance to observe
the very beginnings of Chinese philosophy.



                Structure and content
The Zhouyi consists of sixty-four chapters, each with four sections.
These consist of: a tag or title; a six-line diagram or hexagram;
a brief text referred to as the “judgment” or “hexagram text”
that often includes all or part of the invocation: “Begin with an
offering; favorable to divine.” The remaining section consists of six
“line texts,” each nominally associated with one of the lines of the
hexagram figure. It is likely these elements originated separately
and were assigned to the hexagram lines by compilers, of whom we
have no record. The texts and/or hexagrams were not intended as
literature in an aesthetic sense, and certainly not as psychological
guidance. The Zhouyi was simply a catalogue or compendium of
reponses to divinatory inquiries. Unfortunately we have no records
of the actual inquiries, nor of how the Zhouyi phrases were inter-
preted during actual divination, nor of the sociology of their use. The
Zhouyi is really a sort of reference book. The various bits of text only
occasionally form a sequential narrative, and then for only a few lines.
    To select the appropriate diagram and text, a variety of random
methods have been used. These include sorting of a bundle of
xxviii	                Quick start guide



fifty yarrow stalks, tossing three coins, other ways of counting to
generate random numbers from one to six, and selection of beads
from a pouch. These lines can be solid or broken (later yang or
yin) and each can be fixed or changing. Each action is repeated
six times to generate a complete hexagram. Usually only one line
of text constitutes the response, but there are an immense variety
of interpretive systems. Some of these are discussed in Part 4.
Whatever method is used, the replies generated by the Changes are
much more concise than those of such currently popular divination
methods such as astrology or Tarot. It works to clarify a present
situation, not to tell an entire life story.



                      Interpretation
The I Ching has been interpreted in two distinct ways, though
these are often merged in actual practice. So far as we know, the
earliest method was based only on the texts. This became the yili or
meaning and principles method. Later, possibly by the Spring and
Autumn Period, but certainly by the Warring States Period, yin and
yang were added to the types of lines, and also to the positions of
the lines within the hexagram. Two schools of divination arose, the
xiangshu 象數 or images and numbers method, and the yili 義理,
or meaning and principles method. [Nielsen: 303; Rutt: 45] Many
commentaries on the Changes, including those of Wilhelm-Baynes,
confuse these two methods by implying that the meanings are
based on the texts, while they are more often based on trigram and
line positions. We should not fault Wilhelm for this. His interpreta-
tions reflected the practice of his Chinese “honored teacher” Lao
Nai-hsuan, who in turn understood the text as it was read by the
literati of the late Qing Dynasty. Such distinctions are important
for scholarly study, but not necessarily when the I Ching is used for
divination or spiritual inspiration.
    As a reconstruction of the ancient meanings, the present trans-
lation bases its readings entirely on the texts because there is no
evidence for diagram-based interpretations in the Western Zhou.
It is important to note that the early meanings may not be the
“original” ones, nor are they the only “correct” ones. From a
scholarly viewpoint, the meanings of any scriptural text have
	                       Quick start guide	                           xxix



a history; believers, in contrast, tend to regard their texts as
unchanging.



          A message of encouragement
Since the Zhouyi is notoriously obscure, no one need feel
discouraged if it seems baffling at first. With a little study the classic
can yield many of its secrets; historical secrets, not necessarily the
later mystical ones that have been much more written about. For
me, the greatest reward of reading the Zhouyi is experiencing the
ways of thought of a remote time. If the ancient work contains
wisdom, it is what we can learn about ourselves from its glimpses
into the early life of our species.
   My translation is of the early text, without the later overlays
that completely altered how it was read. I have tried to present
it as accurately as possible in plain English. Rather than leaving
readers on their own, I have provided concise explanations of the
meaning of every line, as best can be determined three millennia
later. In these explanations I have tried to avoid the extremes of
leaving too much unexplained, or of overwhelming the text with
many pages of notes.
   Of the wisdom for which I Ching has been admired, not much is
to be found in the Western Zhou text. If it is a self-help book, it is
a self-help book for life as it was lived 3,000 years ago. For those
interested in the Changes as a book of wisdom, Chapter 8 offers my
thoughts on how the Zhouyi might have inspired the later philo-
sophical and ethical ideas associated with it.
   Starting out, it is best not to try the read the work straight
through as one would read a novel or history book, because the
order of the hexagrams and the texts associated with them is mostly
arbitrary. A better way is to start reading by topic, as suggested in
Part 4. For a quick first reading, I suggest hexagrams 1, 2, 11, 12,
63, and 64, which are some of the most interesting.
   As a primary goal in this work is reconstruction of the early
meanings, I have not designed the translation for contemporary
divination, but it can be used for this purpose, though with some
exercise of imagination.

    Why another translation?


Confucius famously said, “Give me a few more years—if I have
fifty more years to study the Book of Changes, then perhaps I, too,
can avoid any great errors” (Lunyu 7.16, in Watson 2007: 50).
    I am certainly no Confucius, my publisher will not give me
fifty more years to complete this translation, and it is exceedingly
unlikely that I will ever be without errors. Having acknowledged
this, we have the advantage of knowing a lot more about the Book
of Changes than Confucius could have. It was at least 200 years
old when he lived. In fact it is doubtful he knew of it at all; the
reference to the Changes in the famous quotation above is likely
an editorial addition.
    To explain the need for a new translation I need to clear up
some of the many confusions that have grown around the Book
of Changes. Most fundamentally, although it is often referred to
as a single work, this is misleading. As originally proposed by my
colleague and collaborator, Hon Tze-ki, it is useful to consider
it as three distinctive works. First is the Zhouyi, the ancient text
produced in the Western Zhou Dynasty of China’s Bronze Age
(1046–771 bce) and the basis of my translation. Next is the I
Ching (Yijing), consisting of the Zhouyi text to which were added
the canonical Ten Wings. The date of these is uncertain, sometime
in the late Warring States Period (403–221 bce) or early Western
Han Dynasty (206 bce–24 ce). It is in the Ten Wings, particu-
larly the 大傳 Dazhuan or Great Commentary, that we first find
the cosmological and philosophical ideas that became associated
with the classic. During most of Chinese history, this philosophy
4	              THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



was assumed to be somehow latent in the early text, but modern
scholarship has cast doubt on this. Finally, there is the modernized
version now read in many different languages and cultures. I here
refer to it by the older Wade-Giles Romanization, I Ching, usually
mispronounced by Anglophones as eye ching. The correct pronun-
ciation is more like eee jing, spelled Yijing in the modern pinyin
Romanization.
   Credit for recreating the classic for modern non-Chinese readers
unquestionably goes to Richard Wilhelm (1873–1930), a Protestant
missionary long resident in China who studied the Changes with
the aid of his traditionally educated informant, Lao Nai-hsuan.
It is particularly the Bollingen Foundation/Princeton University
Press edition, with Wilhelm’s German translation rendered into
English by Cary F. Baynes, that made the work famous. Baynes was
educated in psychology and was a follower of the Swiss psychiatrist
Carl F. Jung. She knew German but not Chinese, though Richard’s
son, Helmut Wilhelm, also a sinologist, checked her translation,
as did many others whom she acknowledges in her “Translator’s
Note.” Though meticulously composed, the Wilhelm-Baynes trans-
lation, inevitably, was a product of its time. As Baynes admits:

     one very real compensation for my lack of Chinese [was] the
     access to its philosophy afforded me through my growing
     knowledge of the work of Jung. (Wilhelm Baynes: xli)

Thus from its entry into world literature, the I Ching was seen
through the perspective of modern depth psychology, despite the
fact that nothing like Jungian psychology existed in traditional
China. Psychological interpretation of religion and spirituality
has become so pervasive in modern culture as to usually pass
unnoticed. The I Ching had been translated before, though never
readably enough to attract more than specialist interest. The
Wilhelm-Baynes version, with its Foreword by Carl Jung, benefited
by appearing at a time when depth psychology, with its ideology of
exploring the unconscious, provided a theoretical basis by means
of which all sorts of seemingly non-rational mental phenomena—
myth, fantasies, dreams, and the like—could be valued rather than
dismissed.
   This psychological mode of reading the I Ching is a creation of
the modern West, though also influential in China. This mode is
	                 Why another translation?	                         5



not wrong—it is the latest in a long succession of ways to under-
stand the Changes. It is, however, not the way it was understood
in traditional China. While justly admired for its literary qualities,
the German-into-English of Wilhelm-Baynes has only occasional
resemblance to the Western Zhou meanings. It is best thought of
as an adaptation rather than a translation. Strongly in its favor, it
extended the readership of this very ancient work exponentially.
Its attractive presentation of many of the key ideas of Chinese
philosophy has inspired many, including myself, to delve more
deeply into them. Yet at the same time, its synchronic approach
to the classic limits its suitability as a source for learning about
Chinese intellectual history.
   Of the many published and self-published translations, few have
sinological or literary value. For those seriously interested in the
classic, it is important to be aware that most books that purport to
be the Book of Changes or I Ching are no such thing, not trans-
lations at all but paraphrases, often quite loose, by believers or
practitioners who feel that they have special insight into what the
classic “really means,” despite not being able to read any Chinese.
On the one hand, the proliferation of such works demonstrates the
interest engendered by the Book of Changes; on the other hand it
makes it harder for would-be readers to recognize the wheat amidst
the chaff. I discuss the nature of some of these pseudo-translations
in the final chapter.
   It has been said that one cannot understand a classical Chinese
text unless one already knows what it means. This is only a slight
exaggeration. Chinese literati studied the ancient texts under
the tutelage of masters who had often specialized in a specific
work, and who had themselves received transmission from earlier
scholars. Since such traditions now survive only incompletely, we
are to an extent starting over. This allows a fresh look, but also
calls for remaining conscious of the many uncertainties involved. I
have noted some of these in my commentaries.
   Given the polymorphic nature of the Book of Changes, there are
many ways to read it so that any interpretation or translation can
be criticized from a viewpoint different from that of the translator.
While I have often departed from the readings of even my most
learned predecessors, I make no claim that my rendering is inher-
ently better, only that it embodies a different vision of the Zhouyi.
I feel that some of my predecessors have not sufficiently escaped
6	              THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



the influence of the early twentieth-century “Doubting Antiquity
Movement School” (vide infra) in its fondness for obscure, often
unsupported emendations. I offer my version as an alternative,
based on my guiding principle that since the Zhouyi was under-
standable to the readers of 3,000 years ago, a translation should
make it understandable to readers of today. My version is a new
incarnation of the ancient classic and likely not the last. I think
of incarnation in the Buddhist fashion as each life having conti-
nuity with previous ones, but presenting a fresh opportunity to go
beyond what was done in the past.
   An all too common problem with Chinese to English transla-
tions, even scholarly ones, is imprecision—they do not consistently
translate Chinese words with the same English word. This is particu-
larly confusing with prognostic terms, given that the connection
between the rest of the line text and whether the prognosis is auspi-
cious or ominous are frequently unclear. My own view is that the
reason for reading an ancient text is to learn how people thought
in that remote era. This requires translating the special vocabulary
of the text consistently rather than turning it into a contemporary
English book.



     A new paradigm arises: The Doubting
     Antiquity Movement and its followers
My translation is intended as a reconstruction of the early meanings
of the Book of Changes at the time of its origin, the Western Zhou
Dynasty (c. 1046–771 bce). China was still in the Bronze Age—
though so accomplished in using this alloy as to have created some
of the most beautiful objects in the history of art. I am not the
first to have translated with this objective; indeed, this is becoming
standard among Western scholars. The principal translators of this
school, if I may call it such, are Richard Kunst, Richard Rutt, and
Edward Shaughnessy, all of whom have produced versions that
shed great light on the early meanings of the Zhouyi.
    The notion of restoring the early meanings originated
with the already mentioned Doubting Antiquity Movement
(疑古派 Yigupai) of early twentieth century China, although
there were a few in the Song Dynasty who questioned the received
	                Why another translation?	                         7



readings. The philologists of the Doubting Antiquity Movement
were traditionally educated Chinese of great erudition who applied
text-critical methodology to reconstruct what the text meant when
it was actually composed. Theirs was not entirely neutral schol-
arship however, but had the underlying agenda of discrediting the
pre-Qin Dynasty ancient classics as the basis for Chinese education,
government, and society. This was part of an overall re-evaluation
of Chinese culture by some of its literati, who considered China to
be backward in comparison to the West, in large part due to the
superiority of Western technology as demonstrated in the Opium
Wars of the mid-nineteenth century. The school was started by
Hu Shi 胡適 (1891–1962) and continued by Gu Jiegang 顧頡剛
(1893–1980), its best-known advocate, and several others. Perhaps
the most influential later Chinese follower of this approach was
Gao Heng 高亨 (1900–86). In the West, the highly esteemed Arthur
Waley (1889–1966) published an article, still influential today,
that set what seems to me an unfortunate precedent for fanciful
emendations, though he never fulfilled his promise to translate
the full text (Waley: 121–42).The most complete exposition of the
critical approach in English is that of the late Father Richard Rutt,
whose work has greatly influenced my own.
    These scholars employed a demythologizing approach that
revolutionized our understanding of the Zhouyi, although has not
been universally accepted. Because the reconstructed early Zhouyi
is clearly a divination manual, not a book of wisdom, many aficio-
nados of the classic have resisted its findings, though without much
objective evidence to support their case. For me, though some of
the reconstructed meanings are unappealing, evidence for them is
persuasive and they transform what seems a swamp of peculiar
phrases, overly-elaborate cosmology, and meaningless numerology
into a text that makes historical sense.
    The Doubting Antiquity approach, however, though greatly
enhancing understanding of the Changes, is not, in my opinion, the
final word, due to its discrediting agenda and to a now outmoded
tendency for imaginative, but unsupported, emendations. Gao
Heng, despite his brilliance, was one of those whose far-fetched
emendations needlessly increased the obscurity of the text, yet he
remains influential. Most of the early translators, notably Richard
Wilhelm, erred in the opposite direction—making the text clearer,
but at the cost of faithfulness. Wilhelm’s rendering was long
8	              THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



unquestioned because until recently translators could work very
freely, given the paucity of Westerners who could read the ancient
language. Despite these animadversions, all these scholars made
enormous and indispensable contributions to our understanding
of the classic.
   However one retrospectively criticizes the Doubting Antiquity
Movement and its successors, they led the way for a total
reassessment of the I Ching. They were basically correct in their
belief that education solely in the ancient classics was not suitable
for governing a twentieth-century country. Their goal was a
constructive one, to maintain Chinese culture by helping to adapt
to new circumstances. Rather than simply condemning the I Ching,
they created a new way to conceive it. The influence of their work is
now scholarly rather than political. Because this movement played
an indispensable role in the development of critical analysis of the
ancient texts, their influence on American sinology continues to
be substantial. My own translation would not have been possible
without their work. Indeed, at the risk of seeming presumptuous,
I consider myself to belong to the Doubting Antiquity tradition,
though with the difference that I prefer to select the most straight-
forward meanings for difficult terms rather than seeking out
obscure ones. I also consider the classics still invaluable for modern
China, and indeed, the rest of the modern world. While trans-
lating, I have imagined myself to be in dialogue with the scholars
of the Doubting Antiquity tradition, hence I have very frequently
referred to the work of Kunst, Rutt, and Shaughnessy, whom I
regard as being in that lineage, broadly considered. I have of course
considered other important English translations, especially those of
Richard John Lynn and Greg Whincup.
   The early twentieth-century agenda of discrediting the classics as
the basis for Chinese government and society is now moot, given
the vast political changes that have since occurred. This opens the
door for translation that is mainly determined by one’s beliefs about
the nature of the text. Scholarship is blossoming in China as well.
Largely suppressed under Mao, the classics are now experiencing
something of a revival, both scholarly and popular, stemming from
national pride and a desire to reconnect with traditional culture.
   Study of the Changes must now consider the recently excavated
manuscripts, particularly those of the Shanghai Museum and
Mawangdui, published with transcriptions and English translation
	                 Why another translation?	                         9



(Shaughnessy 1996, 2014). Despite numerous variants, mostly
homophone substitutions, these texts closely resemble the received
one while at the same time shedding new light on it. Accordingly,
I have collated my translation with the Shanghai Museum and
Mawangdui versions in Shaughnessy’s transcriptions. When I have
substituted their reading I note this in the commentary. For the
most part however, I have stayed with the received text when there
has been no clear reason to change it.
   Work on the excavated manuscripts is still at an early stage and
there are advances in phonetic reconstruction that have not yet
been applied to study of the Zhouyi. Thus there is potential for
further advances in our understanding of the Zhouyi.



    Dispelling the obscurity of the Zhouyi
So difficult is the Book of Changes that scholars have tended to
avoid it and those who do admit interest in it have often been
viewed with suspicion. I discussed this stuffy attitude in some
detail in my previous work (Redmond and Hon 2014: 1–18).This
suspicion is partly due to its association with its faddishness during
the counter-cultural movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Another is
that many in the modern world, even if they do not admit it, are
uncomfortable with the supernatural and try to avoid anything
related to it. Still another factor is that some textual scholars are
understandably uncomfortable with texts whose meanings seem
almost impossible to pin down. Philology is about precision and
when accuracy is hard to establish, many scholars tend to stay
away.
   A more fruitful approach, I suggest, is to confront the obscurity
directly so as to determine what is causing it. In my view much
of the confusion is due to approaching the text with the wrong
expectations. The Zhouyi is not a narrative and was never intended
to be read in linear, consecutive order. It is made up of fragments
collected from unknown informants and organized to fit the
hexagram structure. Confusion is greatly reduced once it is recog-
nized that the fundamental unit of meaning in the Zhouyi is not the
chapter, nor paragraph (of which there are none), nor even the line,
but the phrase. Phrases within the judgments or numbered lines are
10	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



only sometimes related to each other. Nor, with a few brief excep-
tions, is there any narrative development. This inevitably creates
difficulties for contemporary readers as we are conditioned from a
very early age to expect coherent stories.
   Here are some possible reasons for the Zhouyi’s obscurity:
   First, the text might be highly corrupt, surviving only as
unconnected fragments, like the Greek poetry of Sappho or the
philosophy of Parmenides. To the extent that this is a factor, it is
probably a minor one. From the excavated manuscripts we have
learned that the text was highly conserved, suggesting that the
received text is quite close to what was originally composed. The
fragmentary nature of the text is almost certainly its original form.
If manuscript misadventures play a role it is a minor one.
   Many early texts were essentially mnemonics or notes. The
meanings of the text would have been supplemented by orally
transmitted material passed from teacher or master to student.
This is hardly unique to the Chinese classics. For example, it is
true of many difficult Buddhist texts as well, notably the Heart
Sutra. Some of the orally transmitted explanations have been set
in writing, but a large portion must inevitably have been lost.
This master-to-student mode of teaching was still prevalent at the
end of the imperial system, but in the case of the I Ching, what
was transmitted was not the Western Zhou meanings but the
much later Confucianized ones. Oral teachings by their nature
tend to present the material as timeless, rather than as historically
conditioned.
   A further source of mystification is the very thing that made
the Changes unique—the hexagrams. These serve to give the
appearance of precise organization to what otherwise were random
and often unrelated fragments. The texts are not meaningless,
rather they are mostly simple, down-to-earth statements without
hidden meanings. Given the profundity attributed to the Zhouyi,
it was the task of later exegetes to uncover—actually mostly
invent—its deep meanings, assumed to be present considering
the work’s sagely origins. The textual basis of the meanings that
became attributed to the ancient texts is by no means self-evident;
readers have been struggling ever since to connect the Confucian
interpretations with the Western Zhou text. Even the Ten Wings,
supposedly clarifying the meanings, are mostly about matters not
present in the Western Zhou text. As a result, the Zhouyi can be
	                 Why another translation?	                        11



better understood without relying on the Wings or other later
commentaries.
   With texts that can be regarded as occult or esoteric, there is a
tendency for the meanings attributed to them to become progres-
sively more elaborate and convoluted over time, increasing their
seeming obscurity. We see this in some sections of the Ten Wings,
with lists of symbolic associations, and in the work of later
commentators such as Shao Yong 邵雍 (1011–77), whose mystical
interpretations of the trigrams and hexagrams became so elaborate
that even his friends found them baffling. Of course, there might be
as yet unrevealed secrets in the text or hexagram figures, but I leave
this possibility to those who enjoy such speculations.
   The reconstruction of early meanings replaces the abstruse
philosophy attributed to the classic with the difficulty of under-
standing an historically remote way of life, different in many ways
even from Confucius’s time. However, as I hope my translation
will demonstrate, once we release ourselves from the need to
discover profound secrets in the Book of Changes and read it in the
language and context of Western Zhou civilization, most meanings
became clear. Many of the folkways, notably human sacrifice, will
forever remain strange, but this is the strangeness of the human
species, not the text.



        Opening a 3,000-year-old book
So different is the Changes from the other Chinese classics that
even learned sinologists often confess to difficulty comprehending
it. The best advice I can give anyone starting to read the Zhouyi
is to give up one’s assumptions about what constitutes a book.
Most translations of the I Ching, while replacing the Chinese with
English, leave it up to the reader to figure out what it means.
    In the hope of sparing my readers from the anguish I at times
endured in grappling with this elusive text, I have provided
commentary explaining nearly every line as best I can, based on the
presumed early meanings. I also point out some of the irresolvable
ambiguities to give a better sense of the multiple ways the text
could have been read. This strikes me as the only truthful way to
do this, because the Zhouyi works by what might be termed fuzzy
12	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



logic—it is suggestive rather than specific. In starting to read the
Changes, it is best to accept that many passages will seem strange,
even bizarre, at first. With further reading most passages become
clear as one gets a feel for how its imagery works. Still, a few
passages will always resist attempts at explanation. Accordingly, I
have tried to point out when my translations are merely specula-
tions. Indeed, I suspect that a few phrases were not understandable
even 3,000 years ago. Frustration can be minimized by recognizing
that, like many divinatory texts, the Zhouyi works by stimulating
thinking rather than by directly conveying information.
    In reading the Book of Changes, and therefore in translating it,
it should be kept in mind that there are two fundamentally different
ways it can be read. Most readers, both past and present, have
been enthusiasts or aficionados for whom it is a form of spiritual
practice, either for divination or as a source of wisdom. Some
practitioners attain a deep scholarly knowledge of it as well. Many
develop a deeply affectionate bond with the book. They may use
it daily for divination, or they expend countless hours trying to
find a hidden pattern in hexagram arrays, or they may re-read it
frequently as some do with the Bible.
    While I appreciate much of the philosophy that has been
attributed to the I Ching, particularly that of the Dazhuan, or
Great Commentary, to me what is most interesting about the
classic is the Western Zhou layer and the glimpse it provides of
human consciousness at an early stage, during the slow transition
from orality to literacy, arguably the most important event in the
existence of homo sapiens. (Although the earliest extant evidence
of Chinese writing, the Wu Ding oracle bone inscriptions, preceded
the Zhouyi by several centuries, the development of the expressive
capacity of written language was very gradual.) Recovery of the
early meanings requires a critical, scholarly approach that tries as
much as possible to let the words have the meanings they do and
remains untroubled when the text is not as one would like it to be.
    Within a page or two of starting, the reader of the Changes will
be confronted with a paradox. He or she is holding a book that
has been held in immense esteem for thousands of years by one of
the world’s most admired cultures. Yet the immediate impression
is of a jumble of phrases ranging from incoherent to bizarre. Only
courtesy restrains one from calling it nonsense. If one decides
to persevere—as I have for more than two decades—one will
	                Why another translation?	                        13



encounter a text unlike any other he or she has read. Continuing
to read, neither plot nor thematic development is apparent. An
early Western scholar mistook it for a dictionary, and he was more
correct than has been acknowledged. The Book of Changes is
indeed a reference work, but of a sort that is no longer standard—
a compendium of phrases for responding to divinatory inquiries.
So important were divination manuals in early China that this was
one of the few categories of books not ordered to be burned by
Qinshi Huangdi the notorious first emperor of the Qin Dynasty,
perhaps best known for the terracotta army that that still guards
his tomb.
   Even if we allow for the vastly different problems of our long-ago
ancestors, we are still challenged as we try to understand a text
composed in a very different way from even the oldest Western
classics that we are likely to have encountered: Homer, Plato, the
Greek dramatists, etc. Much more like the Zhouyi are fragmentary
texts, such as Heraclitus, Sappho, and occult texts such as those
used for divination or other magical procedures. We need to bear
in mind that the criterion for inclusion in magical texts was their
presumed efficacy, not clarity. They were generally attributed to a
mythical figure such as Hermes Trismegistus in the West or Fu Xi
in China. With occult or esoteric matters it is never self-evident
why a particular divinatory system, or spell or incantation, was
considered efficacious. We must prepare ourselves to engage with
a mentality almost impossibly remote from our own, keeping in
mind that such works held meaning for some smart people long
ago, and ponder why such texts meant so much to so many in the
remote—and even not so remote—past.

  Making sense of divination


Divination has been widely practiced at all times and in all cultures.
Attitudes tend to be split between skepticism and belief, with
relatively little middle ground. In the modern world it tends to be
assumed without any actual familiarity that divination was only
practiced by the ignorant. With recent recognition that scholarship
should study the broad range of human phenomena, not just the
“high culture,” study of divination has become less marginalized.
   The frequent claim that the Book of Changes was not a divination
manual, but a book of wisdom is not historically correct. Hence
to appreciate the work in any of its incarnations, it is necessary
to begin with an unbiased look at divination—a human activity
practiced in all cultures, in all eras. Despite the dominance of the
scientific worldview, taking into account population growth it can
be safely said that divination is practiced by more people now
than ever before. Despite frequent efforts to suppress its practice
by governments, religious authorities and, more recently, scientific
establishments, the mantric arts continue to thrive.



         The universality of divination
That so many ancient writings about divination survive indicates
how important it was to the ancients. What is thought to be the
earliest reference to divination is a Sumerian cuneiform text from
late in the third millennium bce (Barton 1994: 11). The earliest
of the Chinese oracle bones, which are records of divination, date
16	                THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



from about 1200 bce (Keightley 1985) and have been extensively
written about and studied in both Chinese and English. Critical
scholarship on divination also began quite early, with Cicero’s
wide-ranging De Divinatione (44 bce) plausibly being the first
comprehensive and skeptical assessment.
   A broad modern conception of divination, that goes beyond
dismissing it as mere fortune-telling, recognizes it is a multiplicity
of methods for seeking knowledge that is not attainable by normal
means. A useful definition is that of Ulla Susanne Koch:

      […] a practical means of obtaining otherwise inaccessible infor-
      mation … . The kind of knowledge involved can pertain to
      the future, the present, or the past; the source can be … gods,
      ancestors, spirits, or there may be no personal interlocutor
      as such; the privileged knowledge can be obtained by various
      means, ranging from such quiet pursuits as studying the sky …
      or even violent in the form of possession and ecstasy. Divination
      can involve elaborate rituals performed by specialists or it can be
      part of daily life accessible to Everyman. (2010: 44)

Whether divination provides real knowledge, or how it might
do so, is less obvious than usually thought. Divination certainly
affects the mind of the inquirer. While it can be done simply out
of curiosity, it can benefit by providing fresh ways of looking at a
situation. It can allay anxiety—or increase it. At times it has been
thought to reveal the will of the gods, at others to be an intrusion on
God’s omniscience. It can inform about the nature of the cosmos,
the state of the dead, the presence of curses, and more. Without
excluding consideration of these functions, our main purpose in
the present work is to yield insights into the minds of people from
some of the earliest written records of human concerns.
   Divination systems, in providing prognostications, must have
implicit notions on the nature of human existence within the
cosmos. Like other systems such as astrology, the I Ching developed
into a means for philosophical inspiration and ethical cultivation,
conceived in Chinese thought as living in accord with the Dao
or Way of Heaven. Whether divination “really works,” or how
it might do so, is less obvious than usually thought. Accuracy
of prediction is not easily assessed because criteria for accuracy
are difficult to define. Seemingly erroneous readings tend to be
	                 Making sense of divination	                       17



explained away as incorrect interpretations. What divination does
do is create a narrative about the inquirer’s life, giving signifi-
cance to events that may otherwise seem random. Thus it gives an
individual a sense of his or her life as part of the overall pattern of
the cosmos. On a psychological level, the great antiquity of some
divination methods still practiced, such as astrology and I Ching,
demonstrates continuity of modern consciousness with the begin-
nings of human self-awareness.
   With respect to astrology, the philosophical sense of divination
is well summarized by Mircea Eliade:

    […] the horoscope reveals to you a new dignity: it shows how
    intimately you are related to the entire universe … Besides, this
    cosmic predetermination of your existence constitutes a mystery:
    it means that the universe moves according to a pre-established
    plan; that human life and history follow a pattern and advance
    progressively toward a goal. (1976: 61)

In the present work I treat divination as a cultural phenomenon,
rather than as debased science. While many questions posed in
divination may now be better answered by science, such as when
rainfall will occur, the cause of a disease, or even the gender
of a fetus (the subject of a famous, but mistaken, oracle bone
inscription), there are many other sorts of questions that science
cannot address and so remain in the provenance of religion and
spirituality, of which divination can be considered an aspect.
Psychotherapy has more in common with divination than its
practitioners would care to admit. The basis of Freud’s famous
method was, after all, dream interpretation.
   There have been attempts to find a scientific basis for divination,
such as associating yin and yang with negative and positive in
electricity. Astrology has postulated unknown forces by which the
planets affect humans. Such theories distract from serious study of
divination because none stand up to scrutiny. Two approaches seem
more useful to me. First is the historical study of divination, as in
the present work. The second is investigation of how it functions in
the lives of people who use it, which I have addressed in an earlier
work (Redmond and Hon 2014: 19–36). Popular treatments are
often too general to be of serious interest but a few, such as that
of Barretta (2009), give a vivid sense of the role divination plays
18	               THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



in the lives of actual believers. A fascinating personal account of
contemporary Asian divination is that by the late Tiziano Terzani,
an Italian journalist long resident in Asia (1997).
   It is curious that divination, including the I Ching, was orthodox
in traditional cultures yet counter-cultural in the modern West.
Its appeal is well described by Bernadette Brady, a prominent
astrologer, in a discussion of the relation of astrology to modern
science. Summarizing the views of Patrick Curry, she writes:

      astrology is a form of enchantment, a way in which humanity
      encounters mystery, awe, and wonder … it was necessary
      for astrology to be marginalized by science in order for it to
      maintain this position … any success gained by astrology in
      becoming creditable in the view of science would be at the price
      of its soul. (70f.)

This well expresses the nostalgia for the enchanted world that
is common in our time and is, no doubt, a major reason for
contemporary interest in the I Ching. Nostalgia was also part of its
allure in traditional China for those who, like Confucius, longed
for the supposed virtue of the long-past era of King Wen and the
Duke of Zhou. Thus the I Ching was in a sense counter-cultural
in that its association with an idealized antiquity could serve to
criticize the present. The modern nostalgia for the enchanted world
is to some degree fallacious—the Zhouyi depicts an era when
all were in constant terror of supernatural entities who required
human sacrifice to be propitiated, and of pervasive warfare without
notions of peace or compassion.
   Curry’s opinion illustrates another set of assumptions that
impede serious consideration of divination—that divination, like
other “superstitions” is in a zero-sum contest with science for
the contemporary mind. In actuality, all sorts of spiritual beliefs
can be held simultaneously with scientific ones. Here Curry
inadvertently accepts the narrative he resists—that religion and
magic will entirely be replaced by science. In this view, those who
continue to adhere to religious modes of understanding are stuck
in a primitive way of thought. Furthermore, religion and magic
are harmful as they inhibit the progress of the rationality needed
to solve human problems. In contrast, no less a rationalist than
Ludwig Wittgenstein was more open-minded, declaring that we
	                 Making sense of divination	                         19



cannot understand early beliefs and practices if we regard them as
simply mistaken. This brings us back to my basic point that what is
important about the study of divination is not whether it “works”
or not, but its place in the lives of those who used it.
   While divination has long been excluded from academic
philosophy, many practitioners of divination hold advanced degrees
and write with considerable learning and intelligence. One psychic
who advertises online was a professor at Yale. This does not mean
that divination is “true,” whatever that might imply, but it does
establish that it cannot be dismissed as the product of ignorance.
   Divination is related to philosophy in another way—it must
be based, if only implicitly, on a cosmology, a mental model
of the universe. The earliest divinatory method is probably the
assumption that there exists another realm, one inhabited by
supernatural beings who can know things that we do not. These
beings might be deceased ancestors, gods (Apollo for Delphi, for
example), or spirits, who might be angelic or malevolent. Christian
heresiology denounced divination but did not question its reality.
Rather, it forbade it, claiming that the information came from
diabolic spirits intent on causing harm to the practitioner and
to the Christian faithful generally. A deeper reason is probably
that divination provided access to transcendent reality outside the
church’s control. That even the most draconian repression has
never succeeded in eliminating divination suggests how much it is
valued by those who resort to it.


            Divination and psychology
Insecurity is an obvious reason for divination, but this is not in
itself a criticism as behaviors to alleviate anxiety are universal. It is
also obvious that many diviners are fraudsters who prey on their
clients. Divination can be a powerful means of manipulation. In the
past when diviners served as advisors to the powerful, they must
have acted in their own interest—failure to please the client could
prove fatal. In my experience many contemporary diviners—astrol-
ogers and Tarot readers, for example—are honest and sincere,
though this does not ensure that they always give sound advice.
Nor should we assume that clients credulously accept whatever
they are told by diviners.
20	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



    While the ability to perform divination is sometimes presented
as a rare psychic or spiritual ability possessed by only a few, it is
actually quite common, as is the ability to pray or perform rituals.
People who feel they have an ability typically want to use it, whether
it is driving a car, playing a musical instrument, speaking a foreign
language—or even channeling the dead. In this sense, divination is
carried out for personal satisfaction beyond any specific practical
need. Most astrologers or I Ching readers, for example, do it for
themselves and family and friends, not for income.
    There are several useful ways to think about divination that
are more productive than condemnation on religious or scientistic
grounds. Since the last century, the predominant explanation of
divination has shifted from supernatural and cosmological to
psychological. This was established as the new paradigm by Carl
Jung who redefined the ancient Chinese classic, and divination
generally, as tools for exploring the unconscious mind.
    Jung explained the I Ching with his famous concept of “synchro-
nicity” or “meaningful coincidence.” Synchronicity can be viewed
as correlative cosmology in modern garb in that it finds associa-
tions between mental and external events. The notion has become
part of contemporary culture, despite being subjected to stringent
criticism, both by psychologists and scientists. It is suspect for them
because the notion of “meaningful coincidence” or “non-causal”
connection, while not explicitly supernatural, does not close the
door to it. In his writings Jung seems to vacillate on this issue,
perhaps wanting to have it both ways. Indeed, Jung’s archetypal
psychology does seem to embody a fundamental modern ambiva-
lence about the supernatural, although, unlike Patrick Curry,
he does not propose a necessary conflict with science. Indeed,
Jung’s work can be seen as providing a corrective to scientistic
views in showing that the supernatural is embedded in human
consciousness.
    From the somewhat different perspective of cognitive science,
it is almost impossible for the human mind to conceive events
as random. Divination uses randomness to create seeming order.
(Some phenomena used in divination are not truly random, such
as the positions of heavenly bodies at the time of birth, but they
function this way because they are not based on choice.) Seeking
causes of events is of obvious benefit in helping one control them.
Divination activates the mind’s often unconscious processing of
	                 Making sense of divination	                         21



apparent randomness into pattern, but this processing is not
perfect. Thus mental patterns often include irrational elements,
such as vengeful ancestors or spirits or conspiracy theories. Many
contemporary practitioners of divination, to sustain credibility,
tend to avoid referring directly to anything supernatural. This is
not dishonest—psychic mechanisms, though never convincingly
established in scientific experiment, are not necessarily super-
natural (regarding psi generally, see Blackmore 1996, 2004).
    The simplest psychological explanation of divination is that
it is intuition, that is, rapid processing of clues that is not fully
conscious. On this account, the diviner senses things about the
inquirer that are then attributed to a hexagram line text, an array
of cards, planet locations on a birth chart, or a special ability, such
as channeling. Because we are all vulnerable to the same afflictions,
it is often easy for the diviner to guess the inquirer’s concerns. In the
Western Zhou common concerns included pleasing the powerful,
avoiding blame, correct military tactics, sacrifice, safe traveling,
and avoiding bandits. All these are life or death matters, in contrast
to modern divinatory queries, which most often involve romance,
career decisions, and the like. Those are rare in the Zhouyi because
for arranged marriages mutual attraction was not necessarily a
factor, though partner suitability was. Career was more determined
by birth than choice.
    Much of what happens in divination can be explained as “cold
reading.” In this technique, which lends itself to outright deception,
broad statements are put forth by the diviner, who then develops
them based on the inquirer’s response. Statements such as, “You
are under a great deal of stress right now,” or, “You’ve had a
loss,” are so open-ended as to almost always attain an affirmative
response from anyone. In the Western Zhou, the equivalents might
be, “You will be meeting a powerful person,” or “Your servants
might run away.” Skeptics often dismiss all divination as cold
reading, but it seems to me excessively reductionist. I think we can
understand the experience of divination better if we allow it to
keep some of its mystery.
    Intuition is a common explanation for correct divinations,
but this faculty is itself mysterious. It is usually explained as
very rapid, not fully conscious mental processing of subliminal
clues. In contrast, psychic explanations imply direct, non-sensory
communication between minds. Extensive research has failed to
22	               THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



convincingly demonstrate paranormal capacities, though many
individuals believe they have had such experiences. (For a skeptical
account see Blackmore 2004: 288–303 et passim.)Yet direct,
non-sensory communication between minds, while unproven, does
not inherently require the existence of anything supernatural, and
could be due to an as yet undiscovered physical interaction. While
anecdotes of psychism abound, almost invariably these are third
person accounts that require suspension of disbelief. So we are left
where we began—divination and the supernatural are common
modes of human experience, partly but perhaps not entirely
explainable by psychology. Love of mystery and belief in unseen
realms seem to be hard-wired into the human brain. (Science also
has its unseen realms—neither subatomic particles nor black holes
can be perceived through the senses.)
   Regarding the Changes and divination generally, the dominant
paradigm of reducing these to psychology has the appeal of
bypassing all these uncertainties. As Jung himself, while clearly
advocating the I Ching as a tool for self-discovery, by means of the
non-causal principle of synchronicity, declared:

      I have no answer to the multitude of problems that arise
      when we seek to harmonize the oracle of the I Ching with our
      accepted scientific canons … nothing “occult” is to be inferred.
      My position in these matters is pragmatic … (1949: xxxiiif.)

This leaves open the question of why, in the present day, many
turn to divination instead of, or in addition to, more conventional
sources of advice such as psychotherapy. One reason may be that
it is easier and cheaper. But beyond this, there is something about
divining that satisfies human needs. It holds the allure of adding
something unknown to one’s life.
    I like to let Jung have the last word:

      The less one thinks about the theory of the I Ching, the more
      soundly one sleeps. (1949: xxxix)

This is true not only because of supernatural fears but also
philological ones. Obsessing over possible meanings of ancient
words is not necessarily conducive to easy sleep.

             History and the
           intellectual context


                The date of the Zhouyi
The most basic fact about anything historical is its date. This is
not only important in itself, it allows us to explore context, as well
as what preceded and followed it. History is about development.
When studying ancient times, even approximate dating is still
helpful for many purposes. While we do know that the Zhouyi
is very old, its composition can only be fixed within a range of
centuries. Needham once termed the dating of the Zhouyi, “one
of the most disputed of sinological questions,” and it remains
disputed today (1956: 306). Given that the received text was
almost certainly developed over many years, and contains much
that had previously been transmitted orally, a single date is not to
be expected.
   According to myth, Fu Xi, nominally c. 12,000 bce, was
inspired to invent the trigrams by numbers or figures that he saw
on the shell of a turtle. The addition of the judgment and line texts
were apocryphally attributed to King Wen and/or the Duke of
Zhou, which would approximately date the origin of these texts
to c. 1046, the time of the Shang to Zhou dynastic transition. This
date was widely accepted in traditional China but recent schol-
arship finds no evidence of a role for these culture heroes and has
moved up the estimated date of composition.
24	                THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



  Rutt, who does not accept the tradition about King Wen and the
Duke of Zhou, summarizes what we know about dating as follows:

      It is not unreasonable to conclude that the book as we now
      have it comes from later Western Zhou times, possibly the last
      quarter of the ninth century (825–800 bc); but the material in it
      may well reflect an oral history going back three to five centuries
      or more. (33)

He further notes that quotations in the divination anecdotes of the
Zuozhuan, (which he dates as late fourth or early third century
bce), differ minimally from the received text, suggesting that
the text was relatively fixed by this time. The earliest excavated
manuscript of the Zhouyi, that owned by the Shanghai Museum,
is reliably dated to c. 300 bce. Though there are many varia, most
are non-substantative, confirming that the text was mostly stable
by that time. It is similar with the Mawangdui silk manuscript,
found in a tomb sealed in 168 ce. This also has variants, notably
a different ordering of the hexagrams and different tags for thirty-
three of the sixty-four hexagrams. Yet the variants are not such as
to radically alter our understanding of the Changes.
    Shaughnessy (1999: 295f.) has proposed a somewhat less
ancient date, close to the end of the Western Zhou (771 bce).
While these estimates vary over a range of nearly three centuries, it
remains that the Zhouyi is very ancient and was transmitted with
relative consistency. Whatever date is accepted for the Zhouyi it,
along with the Hebrew Bible, remains one of the two oldest texts
in continuous use. (There are older texts from Mesopotamia and
Egypt but these have not been in continuous use.)
    Stephen Field takes an alternative approach and accepts the
traditional view that the line texts were authored by the Duke of
Zhou (2015: 16 et passim). His commentaries attempt to connect
many of the lines to events at the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty.
This is in accord with a revisionist tendency that wants to maintain
the traditional beliefs about the I Ching. I regard this as providing
a useful counterbalance to Doubting Antiquity but feel that, just
as we should not arbitrarily discard traditional accounts, neither
should we accept them without evidence. Field is a distinguished
sinologist and scholar of divination so I suspect his translation is
akin to a thought experiment—working out what the line texts
	         History and the intellectual context	                     25



would mean if they really were composed by the Duke of Zhou. To
my knowledge there is no evidence for this culture hero’s role other
than a tradition that arose centuries after his lifetime. Nonetheless,
given all the uncertainties about this mysterious text, I believe there
is room for translations that, like Field’s, employ alternate assump-
tions, so long as they are stated forthrightly.



         The physical nature of ancient
                Chinese texts
Some idea of the physical basis of ancient Chinese texts helps
to appreciate the problems faced by paleographers (specialists
in ancient writing) in restoring the archaeological remnants to
readable form. Bound books of the sort that fill our shelves did
not exist in ancient China. Books were either bamboo strips
or silk; characters were brushed on (see frontispiece). Bamboo
was most widely used. Fewer silk manuscripts have survived,
perhaps because silk is more perishable. Important examples of
the latter are the Mawangdui Changes and the so-called Chu Silk
Manuscript, which date to approximately 300 bce (Barnard). For
the received text as read from the Han Dynasty onward, we have
no early manuscript version.
   Virtually all early manuscripts have lacunae. Additionally, the
order of textual elements is often uncertain because the leather
thongs that bound the bamboo strips disintegrated long ago, leaving
the strips scattered out of their original order. (For the fascinating
story of the reconstruction of the order of the Shanghai Museum
bamboo manuscript based on the breakage patterns of the strips, see
Shaughnessy [2014: 47–66].) Silk manuscripts are more perishable
but have the advantage of preserving the order of the text. All
manuscripts were chirographic until the rise of woodblock printing,
which is better suited to Chinese characters than movable type. The
earliest known printed book, many centuries later than any Changes
manuscript, is the British Museum’s famous Diamond Sutra, dated
868 ce. With the invention of printing the Chinese classics attained
wider dissemination and hence inspired many commentaries.
   All of the manuscripts of the Zhouyi are written in ancient
forms of the Chinese scripts. Except for facsimile versions, nearly
26	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



all of which are published in China, all printed versions use
Kaishu (standard traditional characters which came into use
gradually, beginning in the late Han Dynasty) or Jiantizi (simplified
characters). Most modern printed editions of ancient manuscripts
are actually transcriptions of the bamboo strip, oracle bone, bronze
or other early scripts. For the most part, the transcription of
ancient scripts into contemporary ones is straightforward for those
with the necessary paleographic knowledge. However, what we
read now looks quite different from the early originals.



          The (dis)organization of early
                  Chinese texts
Modern books, other than some that are deliberately avant
garde, are organized upon clear principles. Novels are narratives;
although there may be flashbacks, the story unfolds in a coherent
way. Non-fiction is organized by chapters, each of which has a
specific topic. Dictionaries and encyclopedias are alphabetical.
Early Chinese texts follow none of these principles. They are
compilations of material from diverse, unspecified sources. While
they may have a unifying theme—answers to divinatory queries
in the case of the Zhouyi—the ordering of material within the
text often seems random. The Lunyu (usually translated as The
Analects of Confucius) for example, is an assembly of anecdotes
without clear thematic organization but unified by the presence
of Confucius and his disciples. The Zhuangzi (which takes its
name from its philosopher author), like the Lunyu, has a generally
consistent philosophical outlook, yet treatment of specific topics
extends for at most a few paragraphs and thematically related
anecdotes are not necessarily placed together. Other early texts
similarly are not thematically organized. Familiar examples are the
Dao De Jing (The Classic of the Way and Virtue), the Zhuangzi,
the Lunyu, and the Zuozhuan (supposedly a commentary on the
Spring and Autumn Annals). All have some degree of unity with
respect to ideas, style, rhetorical patterns, voice, and so on, but lack
the coherently organized structure we expect from books. Thus
early editors thought differently from later ones. They seem to have
envisioned their role as getting all the material safely into written
	         History and the intellectual context	                     27



form, rather than imposing systematic organization. And, to give
them their due, at a time when few copies of texts existed and
writing materials were scarce, their priority had to be preservation
of the material entrusted to them.
    With early Chinese literature we can see a progression toward
greater thematic organization, although collections of anecdotes
continue to be created. (I use the term literature to refer to any
writing other than mere record-keeping, not in the modern sense
that limits it to poetry, fiction, drama, and essays.) The Spring and
Autumn Annals, a bare listing of events during the 241 years from
722 to 481 bce has only a few events recorded for each year, many of
which are executions, with the criteria for including specific events
being unclear. The work can be likened to a random collection
of newspaper headlines without any articles below them. In the
Zuozhuan, nominally a commentary on the Spring and Autumn
Annals but probably composed centuries later, we have complete
anecdotes. Still later, the Grand Historian, Sima Qian (d. 86 bce)
assembled material from diverse sources, put them together into
chronological narratives and provided his own commentary.
    In this evolutionary scheme of Chinese writing, the Zhouyi
belongs almost at the earliest stage. Only the Shang oracle bone
inscriptions are more limited in their expression. The earliest of
these inscriptions were made c. 1200 bce and consist of brief
divinatory inquiries, sometimes with a few words recording the
outcome. These writings are of great historical (and aesthetic)
interest but do not attain literary status. In the Zhouyi, unlike the
oracle bone inscriptions, phrases are assembled into larger units,
made possible by use of bamboo and silk instead of bone, but are
still extremely terse.
    It is hard to escape the conclusion that earlier writers simply did
not have the expressive concepts that were available to later ones.
Either the vocabulary and concepts did not yet exist, or the mental
effort to write more details was simply too great. (If the latter seems
implausible, remember how hard it was to write a paper of just a
few sentences in elementary school.) I do not believe these early
writers were holding back or lazy; rather, their culture had simply
not developed the means to express much that later could be done
with ease. This is a significant factor accounting for the laconic
nature of the Zhouyi, and also for its suggestive rather than precise
mode of expression.
28	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



    What comes across as lack of organization in ancient texts
makes them less easily readable than later ones. At first they can
seem a confusing jumble. We wonder why they include what they
do and wish they would tell us more. Once we let go of many of
our expectations of what a book should be and take the text on
its own terms, we can make sense of books like the Zhouyi and
even enjoy the reading of them. This enjoyment is not the complete
absorption into a flow state that many novels and some non-fiction
provide, but the excitement of mental travel to a remote place, not
only far away in space and time but, most important, having a
different mode of human consciousness.
    Personally, I am unfazed by the somewhat haphazard organi-
zation of the old classics, partly from long familiarity with them
and partly because I have the peculiar habit of opening scholarly
books at random until I find a particularly interesting or provoc-
ative passage. I do eventually read the whole book, or most of it,
but in my own order. I am not recommending this peculiar way
of reading, but simply pointing out that books can be read in
non-linear fashion. I suspect that many skip around when studying,
based on unconscious shifts in attention or mental energy. Indeed,
when using the Internet, cognitive random walks are the rule rather
than the exception. When we recognize the variability of attention,
the lack of linearity in these old texts should seem less strange.



             The first great transition:
               From oral to written
The earliest texts we have contain much that I refer to as transcribed
oral material, that is material that originally was orally transmitted
and later put into writing. The foundational texts of many civiliza-
tions are of this sort. Examples are the Homeric epics, the Book of
Songs of China, the Ramayana, and the Gospels. What we know
of the words of Socrates, Confucius, Shakyamuni Buddha, and
even Jesus were written down by others, in some cases centuries
later. (The oxymoronic term “oral literature” is best avoided, but
a good substitute has yet to be proposed.) For both translators and
readers of early texts, being aware of the distinctive features of
originally oral material, as contrasted with purely chirographic or
	          History and the intellectual context	                   29



printed texts, helps resolve some of their seeming strangeness. (The
distinction is not absolute, because even today characteristically
oral elements are frequently incorporated into written texts.)
   In what follows I have made much use of Walter Ong’s notions
of orality and literacy, and those of Eric Havelock, the latter based
on the very different Homeric epics. Their scholarship guided me
in being aware of the problems unique to oral transmission and in
recognizing transcribed oral material in the Zhouyi. Walter Ong
holds that underlying the specific characteristics of oral material is
the need to compensate for the limitations of memory. Thus stock
phrases are commonly used and are often put to use to serve multiple
purposes. Referring to the work of Havelock, Ong points out that:

    an oral culture demands that knowledge be processed in more
    or less formulary style and that it be constantly recycled orally—
    otherwise it simply vanishes for good … (Ong and Farrell 2002:
    432)

Furthermore:

    An oral culture does not put its knowledge into mnemonic
    patterns: it thinks its knowledge in mnemonic patterns … It does
    not add formulaic patterns to its thinking. Its thinking consists
    in such patterns. Clichés constitute its thought. (Ong 2002: 480)

And:

    Homeric Greeks valued clichés because … the entire oral noetic
    world or thought world relied upon the formulaic constitution
    of thought. In an oral culture, knowledge, once acquired, had to
    be constantly repeated or would be lost; fixed formulaic thought
    patterns were essential for wisdom and effective administration.
    (1982: 23)

From this latter observation we can start to appreciate why a
book filled with repetitions of standard phrases could come to be
respected as a book of wisdom—it records in permanent form the
key phrases used to express thought.
   There are many set phrases in the Zhouyi, of which the most
obvious are the opening four words, Yuan, Heng, Li, Zhen, in the
30	               THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



Western Zhou a simple invocation, but later read as an itemization
of Confucian moral principles. Set phrases can seem to make sense
almost anywhere. In written material repetitions or clichés can be
annoying, but in oral material they serve to orient the listeners by
expressing a familiar theme. The pervasiveness of set phrases is a
major reason why the Zhouyi seems peculiar to us. Because, as
Ong stresses, oral cultures were always pressing against the limita-
tions of memory, it was more efficient to employ set phrases that
could be adapted to fit many situations than to constantly create
new ones. Someone had to invent the formulaic phrases of course,
but then they became akin to memes, perpetuating themselves by
a process akin to natural selection. Their use was not without
controversy—Eric Havelock suggests that Plato’s famous exclusion
of poets from his Republic was because they relied on the use of
set phrases, rather than the newly invented analytic prose that he
felt was superior.
   Set phrases are incorporated into texts by the process of
bricolage in the sense employed by Claude Levi-Strauss to describe
myth—making use of whatever materials are at hand to serve a
communicative purpose. Bricolage results in a certain monotony of
ideas and some degree of imprecision but at the same time it shows,
by this very repetition, the obsessions of the culture that produced
them. And it makes for efficiency in communication, hence the
pervasiveness of clichés in all languages.
   Ong states that:

      […] abstractly sequential, classificatory, explanatory exami-
      nation of phenomena or of stated truths is impossible without
      writing and reading. (Ong 2002: 8)

These literary elements are also lacking in the Zhouyi, persuasive
evidence in my view that it was created by assembling oral fragments,
the sheer quantity of which made complete memorization rare, if
possible at all. Unique to the Zhouyi is the innovative way invented
to organize the oral material—use of the hexagrams as templates.
Joseph Needham termed this a “stupendous filing system.” Unlike
an alphabetical filing system, the contents were organized to
be accessed by a random method—which is exactly what the
yarrow sticks or coins were suited for, making the structure ideal
for divinatory use. What the diagrams accomplished, other than
	        History and the intellectual context	                  31



providing a visual enhancement for the I Ching was to provide a
framework for rendering the collected material into written form
without altering its original fragmentary nature. This mode of
organization ensures frustration when trying to read the Zhouyi
in linear sequence as one would a narrative text. When used as
originally intended—to locate responses to divinatory inquiries—
the Zhouyi is highly efficient. The experience is further enhanced
by the aura of mystery created by the diagrams.
   Organizing the text by using the hexagrams as templates was an
inspired invention—perhaps even a “disruptive technology”—in
that it gradually replaced the more expensive and time-consuming
pyromancy. As a technology, the hexagrams were a great success;
they are still in use 3,000 years later. As technology advanced
from printed books to computer screens the hexagrams were easily
assimilated. On the other hand, they are a limited invention, with
no application other than divination and metaphysical speculation.
   A few variants on the I Ching arose, using modifications of the
hexagrams. For example the Tai Xuan Jing, or Canon of Supreme
Mystery, used four-line figures with two types of broken lines
(Nylan 1993) but these I Ching derivatives never supplanted the
Western Zhou invention.
   Building on Ong’s point about the limitations of orality, we
can recognize that the diagrams provide a system of access that
permits transcribed oral material to be easily located. Many of the
line texts must have been diviners’ oral prognostications, but no
diviner could have remembered all of them. Nor would a randomly
ordered listing of hundreds of divinatory responses be useful; a
method for picking particular ones would be necessary. To be
credible as divination, the method must not seem like conscious
choice on the part of inquirer or diviner, but a mysterious special
ability. Shamans, channelers, psychics, to give a few examples,
present their pronouncements as obtained from another realm or
an alternative form of consciousness.
   Some I Ching practitioners, past and present, open the book
and browse to find something inspirational for a current problem,
just as some do with the Bible, or Shakespeare, or other similar
repositories of wisdom. I do this myself at times, particularly
with the Dazhuan, the Dao De Jing, and the Lunyu. This is not
quite the same as bibliomancy, in which a passage is selected at
random.
32	                THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



   The hexagram system bears a certain resemblance to the Roman
ars memorativa, in which things to be remembered are mentally
placed on a spatial array. Astrology is another example of this sort of
mental mapping; character traits and life events are assigned to astro-
nomical bodies and their positions. In a sense the Changes is similar,
placing prognostications on a spatial array. Although the technique
is traditionally attributed to a story about the poet Simonides of
Ceos, the method is clearly pre-literate in that it is a means of
compensating for the limitations of memory. (The first extended
consideration of this important aspect of early consciousness is the
justly renowned 1996 monograph by Frances Yates.)
   In oral cultures, the manner of recitation is particularly important.
As stated by the New Testament textual scholar Werner Kelber:

      As was well known by most ancient cultures, living words,
      especially those uttered by charismatic speakers, are the carriers
      of power and being.
      […]
      	 If Jesus was a charismatic speaker, he risked his message on
      the oral medium and did not speak with a conscious regard for
      literary retention. (2002: 481)

Kelber makes the important point that hearing a charismatic figure
is quite a different experience from reading his words. Applying
this insight to the Zhouyi reminds us that phrases that may seem
banal now would have been more moving when sonorously voiced
by a charismatic diviner. Virtually any prognostication would
have emotional impact because it would concern the inquirer’s
vital interests. Yet, particularly in a culture that was only partially
literate, the written word would have been regarded with awe. The
mythical attribution to Fu Xi and the Zhou culture heroes would
have augmented the prestige of the prognostication.
    Ong makes another observation pertinent to that of Kelber and
helpful in understanding the Zhouyi:

      in a culture that lives on clichés [set phrases], almost everything
      that is said for purposes of deliberation or reflection, or specu-
      lation is known to everyone already.

The implication is that because the material is familiar to most
	         History and the intellectual context	                       33



listeners, it is the vigor of the delivery, rather than the content, that
makes recitation interesting. This is true of most political speeches
today as well as those given at ceremonial occasions such as
graduation. In such it is the importance of the speaker that matters,
not the content.
    The Zhouyi was composed at the intersection of orality and
literacy, making the distinction somewhat hazy. A divination
would be delivered vocally, but using a text that in turn consisted
mainly of transcribed oral material. The unique feature of the
Changes, its mysterious-seeming diagrams—intentionally or not—
provided visual stimulation that may have compensated for a
less than intense auditory presence. By its nature, divination is a
rhetorical process and must employ methods of persuasion, often
including visual aids. The hexagrams have a numinous quality
akin to yantras, mandalas, astrological charts, and other sorts
of mystical or sacred diagrams. Though any meaning found in
the hexagrams is the creation of the user, they serve to give an
enigmatic authority to the Book of Changes, an authority that it
holds to the present day.
    Kelber does not discuss the different sort of charisma possessed
by texts, whether manuscript or printed. Texts such as the Bible or
Quran can be extremely moving to believers. We cannot recreate
the experience of listening to Jesus or Mohammed, but we have
powerful substitutes. The I Ching in book form was charismatic
in China. Traditionally it was kept wrapped in silk and it was
considered improper to put another book on top of it. For many
modern I Ching admirers the simple but elegant gray and yellow
Wilhelm-Baynes volume has a special aura. This is true even for
me, despite my approach to the Changes being very different.
    As suggested above, it is not the Zhouyi texts by themselves that
fascinate but their combination with the hexagrams. Together they
signified the possibility that the nature of the cosmos, and our lives
within it, could be explained if one fully understood the diagrams.
Thus the loss of charisma with the transcription of the oral phrases
into writing is compensated by the addition of the hexagrams.
Without these the Zhouyi would simply be a collage of phrases,
many already largely familiar to people of the Western Zhou. By
a phrase’s location in relation to the diagram it seems to have a
unique place within the cosmos. This provides a reassurance that
one’s life events are part of a larger pattern. The Western Zhou text
34	               THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



makes no such abstract claim, but it would have been implicit in
the use of the classic. In the later Dazhuan or Great Commentary,
the claim is explicit:
   The Changes is a paradigm of Heaven and Earth …

      And, in a phrase repeated in Chinese writings down to the
      present:
      Looking up we use it … to observe the configurations of
      Heaven, and looking down, we use it to examine the patterns of
      earth. (1: 4; Lynn 51)

Of course there are ways of making texts charismatic other
than diagrams or illustrations. Buddhist sutras serve more as
devotional objects than as books to be read. In New York’s
Chinatown is a small Buddhist temple that proudly displays a
copy of the extremely lengthy Hua Yen sutra written by a monk
with his own blood. It was locked securely in a thick glass case—
not to be read but to display the power of the Dharma as revealed
in this extreme devotional act. While not the same as actually
hearing the Buddha speak the Dharma, it tells of its extreme
inspirational power.
    In printed books, spiritual authority often derives from its
supposed origin as the words of a religious founder. With the Book
of Changes the authority figures were not deities but Fu Xi, a kind
of trans-human, and the fully human King Wen and the Duke of
Zhou, whose roles as authors of the judgment and line texts are
now considered to be mythical. This helps bridge the oral-written
gap but makes the texts the special knowledge of sagely figures.
    While Kelber argues that oral language is the most democratic
form (21), Ong points out that what is useful is not nostalgia for
the supposedly more authentic non-literate phase of civilization,
but keeping in mind as we read that the material originally held
attention because of its oral presentation. This would be particu-
larly true of divination or any other magical or ritual use of
language—both are mainly oral, even today, despite the Internet.
(The question of the relation between Internet transmission and
orality I will leave to others.) Thus in reading the ancient texts,
it is useful to imagine the intonation and setting that to a great
degree were responsible for their authority. Phrases from the
Zhouyi would have seemed particularly profound if resonantly
	         History and the intellectual context	                    35



recited by a revered adept. Even now, divinations are mainly
provided orally, the foibles of memory contributing to their
perceived accuracy.



The second great transition: Axialization
 and the Confucianization of the Zhouyi
The most helpful heuristic I have found for characterizing the
differences between the mind of the Zhouyi and that of the later
I Ching is the concept of axialization. This term is an expansion
of the notion of the axial age, the contribution of the German
psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers (1883–1969), although
similar ideas had been expressed by others. The basic concept is
that for unknown reasons, reflective thought arose spontaneously
in several cultures at about the same time in history, without those
cultures having any direct contact with each other.
    As a powerful synthesizing concept this has attracted contro-
versy, although I feel the critiques suggest modification, not
rejection, of Jasper’s basic idea. The objections to the axial age
concept are basically twofold. First, that the religious and philo-
sophical ideas that arose in the several cultures were not identical;
and second, that the “axial age” did not occur at exactly the same
time in all cases. I grant these objections and use the concept in
the more limited sense of describing a pivotal transformation in
human consciousness that occurred in many—but not all—cultures
at different times and in very different ways. In this formulation the
“axial age” is modified to “axialization,” a kind of cultural change
that occurred at various points in history, not only c. 500 bce. In
what follows, I refer to those thinkers who initiated the new ideas
as “axial” and those who followed them as “post-axial,” although
these are not hard categories.
    Confucius is perhaps the earliest axial thinker in China, followed
by Laozi, Zhuangzi, Xunzi, and Mengzi, to name some of the best
known. The Ten Wings of the I Ching also have axial character-
istics, though inconsistently. These often inject ideas not evident in
the Zhouyi, such as this from the Daxiang, Greater Commentary
on the Diagrams, referred to as The Image in Wilhelm-Baynes, for
hexagram 42:
36	               THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



      Wind and Thunder: Yi.
      A prince thus sees good and follows it,
      Has faults and corrects them. (Rutt 387)

The Zhouyi text for this hexagram contains no reference to a prince
or upright person, or to self-improvement. The interpretation is
attributed to the trigram positions rather than the line texts, though
how wind over thunder becomes a reference to virtue is obscure.
What is post-axial in this excerpt is the notion of self-examination;
recognizing one’s faults and striving to correct them, a central
theme in Confucius and post-axial Chinese texts generally. While
there are many references to the behavior of princes and nobles
in the Zhouyi, none suggest any concept of moral insight or
self-improvement. These are distinctive axial ideas.
   Among the axial thinkers outside China were Shakyamuni
Buddha, the Hebrew prophets, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
Significantly, only Plato and Aristotle actually wrote the works
attributed to them. Axialization seems to have first appeared
around the dawn of literacy, though there are other theories as
to why it occurred at a particular point in cultural development.
There is also controversy about which early figures were part of
the axial age. For the present discussion it is Confucius (551–479
bce) on whom I will focus. This is because it was mainly Confucian
ideology that produced the axial transformation of the pre-axial
Zhouyi to the post-axial I Ching. Although, contrary to myth,
Confucius himself had nothing to do with the writing or editing
of the I Ching, the ethical, philosophical, and cosmological ideas
added to it are those conventionally referred to as “Confucianism.”
   The basic components of axialization are divided into six aspects
by Charles Taylor (30–46). With some additions and modification
of my own these are:

      1	 Transcendence or going beyond the visible natural
         and human worlds. This often means an alternative
         reality apparent only to a few individuals with special
         insight. Shamanism and some other divination methods
         foreshadowed the notion of transcendent reality.
      2	 Social, ethical, and philosophical criticism based on
         transcendent ideas. Taylor’s examples are the Hebrew
         prophets.
	          History and the intellectual context	                    37



    3	 “Second order thinking” in which concepts used to describe
       the cosmos—heaven, earth, and humanity in the Chinese
       formulation—are subjected to critical analysis.
    4	 Globality (not the same as globalization as an economic
       term)—the belief that ideas apply not only to one’s own
       culture but to all of humanity. Proselytizing derives from
       this aspect of axial thought.
    5	 Disembedding—being able to somewhat separate one’s
       thinking from that of one’s culture. In pre-axial cultures
       religion was an integral part of personal and social life
       not a separate one, and beliefs were neither chosen, nor
       questioned. With axialization, religion and spirituality
       become distinct areas of life and to some degree a matter
       of choice. This permitted the diversity that has been
       characteristic of religious life ever since.
    6	 Religion expands beyond “feeding the gods,” that is,
       making offerings to them to obtain prosperity. The
       pre-axial gods were not necessarily predisposed to
       benefiting humans and had to be bribed. Under axiality,
       gods or God were benevolent, but judged humans on
       the morality of their behavior. However, pre-axial beliefs
       persisted to varying degrees, as we see in present-day
       Chinese funeral rituals.

Karen Armstrong summed up axialization in a more direct way:

    The Axial sages were not interested in providing their disciples
    with a little edifying uplift … Their objective was to create an
    entirely different kind of human being. (123)

This is something of an over-statement. Like the Hebrew prophets,
the “axial sages” would have considered themselves as restoring
the proper way for humanity, not creating a new form. Armstrong
is correct in that axiality initiated new concepts of how humans
should live, but typically, as with Confucius and Laozi, new ideals
were presented as those of a mythical high antiquity.
   Confucius’s thought was axial in nature, though it is sometimes
argued that it lacked a notion of transcendence because his ideal
was a life fully lived in society. However, Confucius’s authority
38	               THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



was the Way of Heaven, a clearly transcendent notion, though
not mystical. He was highly critical of the society of his day that
had fallen away from the ritually correct and simpler society of
high antiquity. He never doubted that his moral principles were
universal. For him ritual was not embedded but a special area of
life that required conscious compliance. The proper motive for
proper behavior was not personal benefit but living in accord with
the Way of Heaven. In contrast, the Zhouyi is clearly pre-axial.
There is no notion at all of transcendence, no reflection on ideals,
people were embedded in society and lacked any perspective from
which to criticize it. Thus the Zhouyi was pre-axial, but with
the addition of the Ten Wings to become the I Ching it became
axialized. In a passage already quoted in part:

      The Changes is a paradigm of Heaven and Earth … Thus we
      understand the reasons underlying what is hidden and what is
      clear. We trace things back to their origins then turn back to
      their ends. Thus we understand the axiom of life and death.
      (I: 4; Lynn 51)

Here the nature of reality is analyzed; there is nothing like this in the
Western Zhou text, which contains no mention of metaphysical or
abstract ethical ideas, no social criticism (regrettably, human sacrifice
and warfare were routine), and no explicit metaphysical theorizing.
   In translating, I have consciously used the notion of pre-axiality
as an aid for my choice of meanings. I do not believe that I forced
this onto the text but rather used it as a guide for consistency with
the characteristics of ancient ways of thought. In my view, some
of the other translations purporting to be of the Western Zhou
meanings, though not the main ones I have cited, have been anach-
ronistic in allowing ethical and philosophical abstractions to creep
in. The notion of axiality helps one avoid such errors.
   At the same time we must keep in mind that the pre-axial
Zhouyi did become the post-axial I Ching. How this happened is a
question of great importance in Chinese intellectual history but it
has not been sufficiently studied, in no small part because suitable
sources are very limited. My tentative suggestions as to how the
Zhouyi may have foreshadowed some of the ethical and philo-
sophical ideas later attached to it are presented in Chapter Seven,
which follows the translation.

          Dialogue and the rhetoric of
                ancient thought
In the West, philosophy and divination often overlapped until the
general rise of skepticism in the eighteenth-century Enlightenment.
Both Socrates and Confucius had some faith in divination, without
it being prominent in their teachings. This does not mean that
everyone was a believer. Jonathan Swift, in 1708 under the nom de
plume of “Isaac Bickerstaff Esq.,” wrote a famous series of satires
discrediting a prominent astrologer, John Partridge. Yet many
philosophers from the axial age on, including Plato, Aristotle,
Confucius and Augustine assumed that divination could be a valid
way of learning truth, at least in some circumstances. Similarly, in
China, many of the most influential philosophers, including not
only Confucius but also Wang Bi, Cheng Yi, Zhu Xi, and Shao
Yong were known for their commentaries on the I Ching. Not
that efficacy was unquestioned; even Confucius was quoted as
saying that when he divined he was correct only 70 percent of the
time. At the same time, there have always been skeptics, such as
the Confucian philosopher Xunzi (310–220 bce) and the Roman
orator Cicero (106–43 bce).
   Many of the earliest philosophical records are in the form of
questions and answers. Discussion, or argument, was the only
way philosophy could be done prior to writing. This is why early
writings such as the Socratic dialogues, the Confucian Analects,
and the Buddhist Questions of King Milinda (c. 100 bce) are in
dialogue form. Dialogue is still intrinsic to education and scholarly
exchange, but with the major difference that participants can also
draw on an immense quantity of material in printed or electronic
form. Though our resources are greater, the methods of teaching
and learning have some continuity with those of Socrates and
Confucius—they still involve debate, then and now quite often
acrimonious.
   Walter Ong emphasizes that pre-literate conversation was
“agonistic,” by which he means that each tried to get the upper
hand on his (usually) opponent (478). Ong rather quaintly attributes
this change to “co-education.” My experience of medical training
and practice demonstrates that agonistic interaction is still with
us. This seems to be less extreme in sinology than the sciences, or
40	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



perhaps the one-upmanship is more subtle. The basic point here
is that intellectual exchange inherently involves parties contesting
with each other, whether cordially or not. This is apparent in the
Lunyu, in which Confucius frequently admonishes his followers,
sometimes insultingly. In a famous example, when asked about
death, he replied, “You don’t yet understand life, how can you
understand death.” There is rhetorical cunning involved here—by
combining insult with evasion the Master implies he knows about
death without having to actually say anything about it.
   Preservation of the rhetoric of orality in spiritual texts is not
confined to those of ancient China. The Theravada Buddhist
suttas, presumably the oldest Buddhist texts, contain deliberate
indications that the material was originally oral, particularly the
famous opening expression, “This is what I heard at one time …”
This phrase serves to orient the listener or reader to the sutta’s
supposedly being a transcription of a talk delivered by the Buddha
himself at a particular place and time, though the time is indefinite.
We are told that even though the Buddha is not present, we will
hear (or read) his words and be brought back to a time when the
sacred was still present in the world.
   There are elements of question and answer in these texts but
their structure is mostly master speaks and followers listen. The
questions are generally rhetorical, usually from close companions
of the Buddha. Though sharing the characteristics of transcribed
oral material, the Buddhist suttas (and sutras) are quite different in
character from either the Zhouyi or the Lunyu.
   Divination, like philosophical discourse, is inherently dialogic.
A question is asked and a response is given. We have no record of
how the Zhouyi was actually used for divination in the Western
Zhou, but it must usually have involved discussion between diviner
and client. In later times, inquirers would dialogue with the text as
a self-cultivation practice, but the I Ching was itself personified as
a sage. Thus even in solitary consultation the process was imagined
as a dialogue.
   The Zuozhuan contains the earliest descriptions of I Ching
divinations, although how much they are related to actual events is
impossible to determine. In one anecdote Lady Wu Jiang is under
house arrest for her part in a conspiracy (Rutt: 187f.). Her inter-
action with the diviner is agonistic in that she directly challenges
the prognostication and clearly wins the argument, even though it
	         History and the intellectual context	                   41



was by criticizing her own character. By foreseeing, correctly, that
she will never be released from house arrest and admitting that
her troubles are due to her own actions, she demonstrates moral
stature. Here, as often with Lunyu, the purpose of the dialogue is
not defeating an opponent but ethical clarification or improvement.
While we do not find this sort of dialogue in the text of the Zhouyi,
it is useful to try to imagine the rest of the dialogue of which the
phrase is a part.
    Textual exegesis has occasionally been likened to divination.
Henderson in his study of Chinese exegesis argues convincingly,
based on some early Chinese texts, that “divination and textual
commentary are … interwoven in several intricate ways” (1999:
85). To modern readers however, philosophical and divinatory
texts seem radically different. This is in part because expectations
tend to filter out discordant elements of a text, including refer-
ences to divination, which most still think has no place in serious
philosophy. Setting this bias aside we can see that divinatory
dialogues have a remarkable similarity of rhetorical structure
with philosophical ones, though they differ in content. In both,
ideas are put out and argued over. Both involve fundamental life
issues. Verbal exchange of ideas recreates pre-literate modes of
cognition. With I Ching readings the selected text is not entirely
sufficient in itself, hence the need for discussion. Agonistic inter-
action occurs not only in teaching, but also in doctor-patient
discussions, religious devotional activities, such as the Catholic
sacrament of confession and even prayer as well as many other
activities that involve oral exchange. Though these may at first
seem non-argumentative, consider that teachers are constantly
correcting students, doctors advising patients to give up unhealthy
behaviors, ministers exhorting their parishioners to give up sin, and
so on. Thus divinatory interactions involve a very basic and ancient
mode of behavior.

                                  4
 The unique structure of the
      Book of Changes


In the preceding sections I have discussed the nature of early texts,
how they were composed, and how to read them. Now I will go on
to show how these principles can be applied to the Zhouyi, both to
locate it in the history of human consciousness and to explain how
it can now be understood 3,000 years later.
    The Changes has a structure like no other book, a cause both
of its fascination and of its difficulty. To make sense out of it,
one needs to understand its structure, a fusion of four kinds of
components. These are the titles or tags, the hexagram figures, the
judgment or hexagram texts, and line texts. The term “hexagram”
has two referents. First and most specifically, it refers to the six-line
diagram associated with each of the sixty-four units that make up
the Zhouyi. Because the hexagram is the first and most distinctive
aspect of each chapter, by synecdoche an entire chapter group
of four elements is often referred as the “hexagram.” Although
strictly speaking “hexagram” should designate only the six-line
diagram, I have followed the usual convention in English and also
used the word to refer to the entire four element unit, though at
times to avoid ambiguity I have used the term “chapter” instead.
44	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



                           The tags
These are the words, or pairs of words, that appear at the top of
most printed versions and seem because of their position to be
the titles of each chapter. Rutt argues, in my opinion correctly,
that most of these words are not strictly titles because they do not
necessarily indicate the subject of the associated lines, rather they
are labels for ease of reference. This is based on several lines of
evidence. First, while some line texts incorporate the tag character,
most do not. Second, in many cases the tag bears little or no
relation to the themes of the line texts of the same chapter. Later
commentators contrived ways of reading the tags, diagrams, and
lines to make them seem related to each other, but these are mostly
forced. The most important evidence of the often arbitrary nature
of the tags is that in the Mawangdui silk manuscript, thirty-three of
the sixty-four tags are different from those of the received versions
(Shaughnessy 1996: 16f.).
   The Wilhelm-Baynes translations of the tags are often poetic,
but at the cost of accuracy. They tend to be based on later
methods of interpreting the trigram components of the hexagrams.
Other English translations of the tags vary greatly—to add to the
potential confusion, there is no standard system of translating
them. Hacker provides a table, though not up to date, that lists
variant translations (1993: 42–63). In the present translation I
have been as literal as possible and avoided altering the meanings
to seem to relate to the judgment and line texts of their chapter.
I believe that the Zhouyi is much clearer if one accepts that texts
grouped together do not necessarily have thematic unity, because
one can then simply accept the literal meanings. In the translation I
have provided the Wilhelm-Baynes renderings in parentheses, since
these are the most familiar to English-language readers.



      The hexagram figures or diagrams
The famous six-line diagrams are the most distinctive feature of the
Book of Changes. (The term “hexagram” is a Western invention;
the Chinese word for the diagrams is 卦 gua, which can refer
both to trigrams and hexagrams.) Without the figures, the Zhouyi
	     THE UNIQUE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK OF CHANGES	                 45



would be just another strange old text. The origin of the figures is
uncertain. One theory is that the hexagrams originally represented
numbers used in the divination process. This is plausible, given that
the numbers one, two, three, and four are written 一, 二 , 三, and
四; this last having originally been written as four horizontal lines.
Some Chinese Neolithic pottery is decorated with linear figures but
none form trigrams or hexagrams. Another suggestion is that the
hexagrams derived from a simple divination system using single
lines, with solid being auspicious, and broken inauspicious. This
seems the most plausible to me, first because yes-no is the simplest
form of divination and still in use with coin tosses, and second
because it is consistent with a simple system that expanded over time.
Many divination systems gradually increase in complexity in order
to provide richer responses, and in the hope of improving accuracy.
Unfortunately, we have no extant materials that show intermediate
stages between the simple linear figures and the hexagrams.
   At some point another variable—fixed versus changing—was
added to the broken-solid duality so that each line could have
four possible values. Changing lines switched to their opposite
so that the first hexagram obtained could generate a second one.
Alternatively, the changing line was considered to be the answer to
the query. The four possible line types came to be associated with
the numbers 6, 7, 8, and 9. This seems not to have been the earliest
number association. Changing lines were “old,” that is, yin or yang
reaching its peak and about to change into its opposite. As yin was
even and yang odd, changing yin was 6 and changing yang was 9;
that is to say, they were at the two extremes of the sequence.
   Despite the eventual predominance of numerological/geometric
interpretation during the Western Han, we have no indication of
such a system in the Western Zhou. It was in the Han that use
of the trigrams and hexagrams lines had become the major way
of interpretation, termed the xiangshu, or images and numbers
school in contrast with the more text-based meaning and pattern
school, yili. Regarding the early meanings of the Zhouyi we have
only the texts as evidence. Hence in the present work I do not
cover the many ideas about the diagrams that are only attested
much later, preferring not to add to the many fanciful beliefs about
them. I must also admit that while I appreciate the aesthetics of the
hexagrams and their arrays, I personally find the texts of greater
interest.
46	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



   Many readers have sought meaning in the ordering of the
hexagrams. Here the Mawangdui manuscript is of particular
interest because the hexagram order follows a different principle
to that of the received version. The sequence is, however, based
on a consistent scheme. (For discussions of trigram and hexagram
patterns see Chung Wu: xxxiii–lx; Hacker 1993: 31–130 et passim;
Rutt: 87–118.) A subculture of I Ching aficionados has concerned
itself with discovering the true order of the hexagrams but to
me this seems somewhat akin to seeking occult meanings in the
proportions of the Great Pyramid. For a very elaborate instance of
reading mathematical patterns into the hexagrams, see R. S. Cook.



                      Why six lines?
The final configuration consisting of six lines was probably not
arbitrary, but based on cognitive factors. I conclude this because
the number of elements in many different divination systems is
of similar magnitude. The Chinese calendar worked on a system
of sixty days and years. Pre-modern astrology had seven planets
(the sun and moon were considered planets) plus twelve zodiac
signs and twelve houses, for a total of thirty-one elements. Runes
work by a system of twenty-four pebbles with symbols. Tarot has
seventy-eight cards. It seems that the mind can most comfortably
grasp elements in this range of between thirty and eighty elements.
Mathematically these numbers are all of similar magnitude. With
respect to the I Ching, diagrams of five or seven would have been
cognitively suitable but would have removed the vertical symmetry
that is visually pleasing as well as the convenient division into two
figures of three lines each. Four or eight lines would have given too
few or too many possibilities respectively. There are also physical
constraints. With runes, more pebbles would have been unwieldy,
as would a larger number of Tarot cards.
   Systems with elements in the magnitude of those discussed seem
to be enough to be responsive to any inquiry; proponents of the
various systems believe they can represent all possibilities. Should
answers prove inadequate, all systems have means for generating
more information. Thus the I Ching has moving lines, Tarot has
spreads of varying numbers of cards, and astrology can calculate
	     THE UNIQUE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK OF CHANGES	                 47



innumerable aspects—angles between any two or more elements.
Now with computers, asteroid positions can be added to the mix.
The possibilities are unlimited but, like language itself, all systems
of divination developed from a limited number of primary elements
or building blocks.



                           The texts
How the hexagrams became associated with the texts is another
of the many mysteries that surround the Book of Changes. It
seems virtually certain that the invention of four types of lines and
their grouping into arrays of six elements was separate from the
collecting of phrases that make up the texts. One reason for my
conclusion is that the cognitive style of working with geometry
is quite different from that of working with texts. (If this seems
questionable, consider how many textual scholars are geometri-
cians, and vice versa.) The diagrams were likely created based on
the visual and geometric possibilities for expanding the two original
types of lines. At some point the idea arose to associate the lines
with specific prognostic texts. Completing the compilation would
require 450 texts (64 judgment texts plus 386 line texts). No single
individual could have known 450 prognostic phrases. (The amazing
feats of memory attributed to reciters of epics were possible because
the material formed coherent narratives, which are far easier to
remember than random phrases. Furthermore, their recitations
varied considerably.) To simply make up this many phrases would
strain anyone’s imagination and would lack any basis of authority.
Thus the only plausible hypothesis is that officials went around
collecting phrases from people thought to have some special
knowledge. These may have included diviners, wu-shamans and
shamanesses, herbalists, and perhaps non-literate people such as
farmers, often assumed by the high-born to have special knowledge.
Given the importance of divination for royal authority, a king may
have decreed development of an official system, or others may have
had the idea, but it seems almost certain that such a project would
have required official sponsorship. How it was decided which
phrase should go with a specific line is uncertain. Certain patterns
can be discerned but this is a subject for another time.
48	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



                      The judgments
These are the brief texts that follow the figures in the received text.
There is no consistent English term for this textual element. I follow
Wilhelm-Baynes, who entitle each “The Judgment.” The other
common English term is “Hexagram text.” Both are misleading.
“Hexagram text” implies an explanation of the diagram or
a summary of the line texts of the chapter. The judgments do
neither of these—in most cases, they have no clear relation to the
hexagram or to the line texts. Later, when the Zhouyi became the I
Ching, it was assumed that the judgments explained the hexagram
figures and summed up the prognoses of the line text, but this was
based on the Confucians changing the meanings.
   The judgments are separate divinatory phrases, somewhat
different in character from the line texts and thus likely to have
come from different sources. This would also account for why they
were separated from the line texts. Possibly the line text positions
were all filled but it was desired to add material from another
source. There are some phrases found in both kinds of lines, but
for the most part they do not overlap. The judgments are often
more detailed than the line texts, but sometimes are only a few
characters, as with the first hexagram, Qian. An example of an
extended judgment is that of Kun.



                 Citation conventions
In referring to hexagram lines, the modern convention is to give
the hexagram number, then a colon, then the line number. In
this system, judgments are designated as 0 and the line texts as
1 through 6. Thus the third line of hexagram 18 would be desig-
nated as 18.3. The first two hexagrams have seven lines, designated
as 1.7 and 2.7.
   This numbering system does not appear in the received
or excavated texts but is a Western innovation created for
scholarly citation. Sometimes an additional number is provided
indicating the specific phrase within a line text. I have not done
this, since the division into phrases is not always clear. Instead,
in the English I have placed each phrase on a separate line so
	     THE UNIQUE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK OF CHANGES	                  49



that references to first, second, third phrase, etc. are clear. The
Chinese text has no phrase separations and so I have not added
them. I have added punctuation to the Chinese to agree with the
English.
   As already noted, judgments have two kinds of components.
The first of these makes up the entirety of Qian 1.0 元亨利貞 yuan,
heng, li, zhen. This is an invocation. Sometimes other stock phrases
appear. The other kind of phrase consists of substantive material
more closely resembling the line texts. An example is 2.0, which
contains the same invocation as 1.0, though with intercalated
words, and other material regarding several matters, including
sacrifice and travel.
   I have translated the judgment of Qian, as “Begin with an
offering for favorable divination.” In some hexagrams all of the
four characters appear, while in others none of them do. The
character 亨 heng, meaning to offer/receive occurs most often and
is clearly the key word, indicating that making a ritual offering to
initiate the divination is beneficial. I strongly suspect that to begin
every actual divination, the entire four character phrase would
have been recited. If so, when incomplete or omitted from the
written text it would be assumed.
   Most translators have taken this four-character phrase as a
favorable prognostication, seemingly ignoring the fact that in many
instances the same line includes unfavorable prognoses. However,
once yuan, heng, li, zhen is recognized as simply the standard
invocation, it is clearly neutral as to whether the appended
divination will be auspicious or not.
   Legge’s translation of 1.0, “Great and originating, penetrating,
advantageous, correct and firm,” is based on the later Confucian
moralistic reading. While it seems simply to be a list of virtues, in
ritual context it likely was intended to help one attain these virtues.
The simple wish for good luck had evolved into a wish to improve
one’s character.
   With the possible exception of 2.1, which refers to sacrifice
of a mare, the nature of the offering referred to in the formula is
not stated. Likely offerings varied depending on circumstances.
It seems unlikely that blood sacrifice would have been practiced
for frequent, routine divinations. Later, use of the Changes
was often preceded by a token offering in the form of burning
incense.
50	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



                       The line texts
Following the judgment, except for hexagrams 1 and 2, all the
diagrams are followed by a series of six texts, each associated with
a specific line. The lines are numbered 1 to 6 from bottom to top.
(Hexagrams 1 and 2 have six lines but an extra line text, desig-
nated as 1.7 and 2.7.) Each line also has another number indicating
whether it is yin, designated by 6, or yang, designated by 9. I have
omitted these numbers in the translation as they are self-evident
from the type of line and simply add visual clutter.
   The line texts vary grammatically; some are short phrases, others
are several sentences. The subject matter is not always consistent
within a line. These texts vary in interest. Some are merely set
phrases, while others are substantive and give us glimpses into
Western Zhou daily life and its difficulties.
   Some scholars find a consistent syntax in the line texts. Rutt
describes their structure as composed of up to four elements:
oracle, indication, prognostic, and observation. He notes that
many lines do not have all four elements and some have none
(131). Field proposes a slightly different scheme of omen, counsel,
and fortune and separates these in his translation, which appears
in tabular form (59–62). These schemes are reasonable approxima-
tions but I have not used either because I feel they give a mistaken
impression that the texts have a more regular structure than is
the case. Also, if the compilers were not completely consistent in
assembling the material, I do not feel the translator should presume
to alter what they did. To the extent there is a recurring pattern I
see it more broadly as a statement of the situation, a prognosis,
such as beneficial or ominous, and sometimes a recommendation
for action, such as making an offering.



      The phrase as the unit of meaning
A common confusion that arises when trying to read the Zhouyi
is trying to relate different phrases in a line, or in the chapter as a
whole, to each other. Though a normal expectation when reading
most literature, this does not apply to the Zhouyi, for which the
unit of meaning is not the chapter, nor entire line text, nor the
	     THE UNIQUE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK OF CHANGES	                51



sentence, but the phrase. Put bluntly, the Zhouyi is a collection of
scraps. Thus a line of text often assembles phrases without evident
thematic relationship. To make matters even more confusing,
ancient Chinese was unpunctuated, as was much of later classical
Chinese. An important—and often difficult—part of translating,
even into modern Chinese, is supplying punctuation to clarify
the grammatical relation of the words to each other. Dangling
modifiers abound. Sometimes the same character can function
as a noun or a verb. Particularly vexing is deciding if a noun is
the object of the preceding verb, or the subject of the following
one. Chinese has helping words for this but they themselves are
not always clear. In contrast to Western languages, pronouns in
Chinese have no gender, verbs no tenses, and nouns no inflections.
Furthermore, Chinese is only incompletely phonetic. Recognizing
the meaning of a character does not ensure one will know how it
is pronounced. Despite all this, Chinese are quite able to commu-
nicate with each other and created one of the world’s great literary
and philosophical traditions.
   Although the characters look intimidating, knowledge of the
stroke order rules for writing them quickly helps make them recog-
nizable and will rapidly bring rewards in reading bilingual versions,
such as this one. The Zhouyi is best read phrase by phrase, not as
an ongoing narrative. This means one cannot attain the relaxed
flow state one does when reading a novel or a newspaper article.
   There are many instances in which phrases about unrelated
matters are combined in a line text. Here is an example:

21.5 Biting dried meat, gets yellow metal. Divination harsh. There
will be no blame.

The yellow metal is probably an arrowhead, presumably found
in the dried meat, making this an auspicious sign. But then the
prognosis is harsh, paradoxically followed by reassurance there
will be no blame. The latter phrase might be a spell to banish
the unfavorable prognosis, otherwise the combination of good
and bad prognoses makes no sense. Here, as often, it seems some
phrases were inserted at random, characteristic of oral material
that depends on memory. Translations add punctuation, which can
make the texts clearer, but care is required to avoid inadvertently
altering the meanings.
52	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



   In my view: sense should be discovered in the Zhouyi, not
added to it. Thus I have not changed word meanings to make
the lines read better. However, some lines have quite different
meanings depending on how they are punctuated. Often the basis
for placement of phrases is not self-evident. Let us look at two
examples. First:

8.5 Appearing together for the king to employ to drive out game
from three directions.
Misses the birds and animals in front.
The people of the region are not admonished. Auspicious.

This line text is a coherent anecdote from early Chinese life: a
group is assembled to aid the king in his hunt. He misses the game,
but those involved are not scolded or punished. There is no real
doubt about the division into phrases.

But then consider the following:

9.6 Now rains, now stops.
This place still holds potency.
The wife’s divination is harsh.
Moon nearly full; for the cultivated person a long journey is
ominous.

Each phrase, with the possible exception of the second one, can
be understood by itself, but they do not have any self-evident
relationship to each other. Perhaps the rain has some relation to
the potency of the location. Together with the third phrase these
may have some reference to the wife’s fertility but we cannot
even guess what this might be. The wife receives an inauspicious
divination, but is this related to her fertility, or to the journey—will
her husband fail to return? Does the phase of the moon refer to her
fertility or to her husband’s journey? Perhaps diviners did not know
either, but read the line to fit the inquiry.
   Here, as throughout my translation, I have used punctuation
and line breaks to divide the judgment and line texts into phrases.
These parsings are my additions, though I have tried not to go
beyond what is implicit in the text. As best I can, I have arranged
them so as to bring out meanings, but resisted the temptation to
	     THE UNIQUE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK OF CHANGES	                53



add relationships between phrases that are not apparent in the
Chinese original. This seems appropriate for a divination text, as
ambiguity would allow the diviner latitude in interpretation. To be
fair to the compilers, given that they had to work with a collection
of randomly chosen phrases, they made the best they could with
the material they had. To give an analogy, putting the phrases
together into an organized book would have been comparable to
taking documents out of a paper shredder and trying to make sense
of them. It is true that the hexagrams provided locations to place
the phrases, but as to how the compilers decided where to put each
phrase there is no evidence.



                      Commentaries
The Ten Wings, which are integral parts of the I Ching, are the
only commentaries that are part of the canonical received version.
Many editions of the Changes, both Chinese and English, include
commentarial material that varies considerably in extent and
quality. Regrettably, the source of the commentary is often not
specified and worse, it can be difficult to tell what is text and
what is commentary. This is particularly true of the Wilhelm-
Baynes version, termed by Joseph Needham, “a sinological maze”
belonging to “the Department of Utter Confusion.” S. J. Marshal
has provided an invaluable map of this maze, but it is unlikely that
most readers will want to take the trouble to seek it out (151–4).
   With the important exceptions of the translations of Kunst and
Rutt, and those of Shaughnessy on the excavated texts, most base
their commentaries on the much later Confucianized meanings.
Often they present the Confucianized meanings as the only ones
and in so doing, while they seem to enrich the meanings with their
commentaries, they also impoverish the classic by depriving it of its
history. Many commentaries, both early and modern, paraphrase
rather than explain difficult passages, limiting their usefulness.
Others provide learned commentaries for some text portions but
say nothing about others.
   The commentaries I have provided with the present trans-
lation have the simple purpose of trying to make each line
understandable, in line with my assumption that since it was
54	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



understandable 3,000 years ago, it can be understandable today.
I have tried to explain obscure words and phrases and admitted
when I cannot be confident in some specific readings. Rather than
offer my preferred choices of meanings as definitive, I often point
out at least some of the plausible alternative meanings. Except
when absolutely essential for clarity, I have avoided adding words
not in the original, with the exception of helping words such as
articles and pronouns. I am sure I have made mistakes despite my
best efforts, but I have felt it more useful to express my opinions
on difficult passages than to simply pass over them.
   I have separated my commentaries from the translation so that
they will not interrupt the flow of reading the actual text. They
provide several sorts of information. First, they give historical and
cultural background for lines that shed light on early Chinese life
or have broad human interest. For key concepts I have provided
more extended explanations. Finally, I have provided glosses on
words of particular significance. These are particularly intended for
readers with some knowledge of Chinese, but should also be clear
to others with interest in the fine points of textual interpretation.
In some cases I have felt the need to justify translating a word or
phrase differently than other translators. Usually this is because I
have a slightly different concept of the nature of the classic. As I
make no claim to infallibility, I feel I should disclose my reasoning
about some of the difficult portions.

   Before the birth of the
 author: How the Zhouyi was
          composed


It was fashionable not long ago to write of the “death of the
author,” though mainly in reference to modern literature. I have
reversed this notion to explain that there was no author for the
Zhouyi and many other early texts, as they are compilations with
no identifiable authors and no conception of authorship. We tend
to take for granted that a book is created by an author or authors
who create or direct its content. This reasonable assumption is
actually one of the many sources of confusion when encountering
the Book of Changes. Hence it is important to consider how early
texts came to be.
   Just as the Zhouyi does not meet many of our expectations
for a book, it does not meet our expectations about authors.
There were no identifiable individuals who consciously created a
text imbued with their own style, point of view, and quirks. The
romantic notion of the unappreciated genius with a unique message
for humanity must be set aside, as must the mythical image of the
sage-hermit meditating in the mountains, occasionally speaking
profound words which were recorded by devoted students. Instead,
early texts were assembled from sources long lost to us—which is
why I refer to compilers rather than authors or editors. A compiler
simply puts together material and may or may not play a role in
selecting and organizing it. An editor shapes the text to varying
56	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



degrees with the intent of correcting or improving it. Editing
complicates analysis of ancient texts as it is often impossible to
distinguish the earliest material from that added by editors long
afterwards. We know that many of the Chinese classics were
modified over time, but there is no textual evidence of this in the
Zhouyi. The work is too complex and heterogeneous to have been
the work of a single person, but as to whether it was put together
by a small group working together or by multiple compilers and
editors over years or even centuries, we have no evidence. Nor do
we have any record at all of the sources that were used. A few lines
are similar to passages in the Shijing, indicating common sources,
but even whether these were oral or written cannot be determined.
   In the absence of actual historical records the best we can do is
make reasonable inferences about the processes that created the Book
of Changes in both its received and excavated versions. Phrases were
collected, as noted previously. Compilers somehow made decisions
as to which of the collected material should be transcribed into the
written manuscript. It is plausible that they or others combined the
short phrases to create the judgment and line texts.
   The next important step would have been to assign each line
of text to a numbered line position within a hexagram. Contrary
to later exegetical tradition, thematic connections between lines in
the same hexagram are limited. There are some distinct patterns of
organization that recur, though only in a few hexagrams. Perhaps
most common is to have line texts within a hexagram share a
common character. Sometimes it is also the tag. Another pattern is
anatomic progression from the feet upwards, for example number
31 咸 Xian Sensation,which describes random-seeming sensations
in different body areas, a common sort of omen. Often, as with
31.4 some lines do not fit the overall pattern. Possibly there was
not enough text and so phrases were inserted to fill the gap. This is
known to be common in recited oral material. One can speculate
that this preference for ascending organization was the specialty
of a specific compiler, with others having different specialties.
Another example of bottom to top progression is number 52 艮
Gen Splitting, about butchering an animal.
   It is best not to imagine that it is possible to identify groups of
hexagrams that were assembled by the same compiler. The various
individuals who collected the phrases, made decisions about where
to place them, and served as scribes must have exerted great effort
	             Before the birth of the author	                     57



and believed that what they were doing was important—and likely
they were also motivated by the threat of punishment if they failed
to please the powerful figures in charge of the project. Yet there is
no sign of literary creativity in the work—it seems intended simply
as a catalogue of divinatory responses. There are no explicit over-
riding themes, as we expect from literary texts. The Zhouyi is more
akin to a technical manual, which is the supposed reason it escaped
destruction in the notorious Qin Dynasty (221 to 206 bce) book
burning.
    We do find recurring subjects, even obsessions, but not the
imprint of an authorial personality. As I demonstrate in Chapter
7 however, close reading of the Zhouyi can reveal themes, not so
much hidden as not conscious, because the means of expressing
them had not yet developed.
    Later ancient texts, such as the Dao De Jing, though they are
also compilations, have clearly identifiable themes and styles of
expression. With Laozi, though he is almost certainly mythical,
we have a sense of a personality behind the words. Even more
vivid is the personality of Zhuangzi, an historical person but not
the author of all the material attributed to him in his corpus. The
Lunyu, though not itself written by Confucius, gives a very vivid
sense of the character and style of the man. The putative authors of
the Ten Wings also express distinctive ideas, but in a more imper-
sonal way.
    Collection of folk material persists in China. Mao sent soldiers
around the countryside to collect the thoughts of the common
people. While this was based on Marxist ideology, the notion that
the common people have a sort of honest wisdom that the upper
classes have lost, and the practice of collecting such material long
antedates Marxism. The Shijing or Book of Songs was created
by this sort of collection but for a book of song lyrics, criteria
for inclusion are relatively straightforward. With the Zhouyi, the
basic principle was divinatory use, a much more nebulous category
than poetry. Many of the phrases are obvious choices—proverbs,
omens, incantations, and prognostic terms. Yet for some others, it
is not clear how they would be applied for divination—for example
some referring to specific historical events, as 35.0:

    Bestowed upon Marquis Kang were numerous horses.
    They became abundant, mated three times a day.
58	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



This is a mini-narrative, describing the Marquis as having a
benefactor and being skilled in animal husbandry, and perhaps
himself as sexually potent as a stallion. Yet, it is not clear how this
phrase constitutes advice and it has no prognostic term, although
the theme of fecundity is obviously auspicious. As with nearly all
the lines, one can find a way to read it as a divinatory response,
in this case to exert oneself to father children, or that diligent
application to one’s work can multiply one’s wealth. Perhaps the
phrase was inserted to flatter the Marquis, or had a prestigious
source. We can make guesses, but cannot be certain of why these
lines were incorporated into the Zhouyi.
    What may seem meaningless to a modern reader—sights such
as piglets, sounds such as birdcalls, sensations such as bodily
twitches, all these would have been immediately recognized as
omens by everyone in the Western Zhou. But what would readers
think of Marquis Kang’s horses or the bridesmaid’s sleeves (54.5),
or a melon wrapped in leaves (44.5)? All we can do is speculate.
Perhaps some phrases were heard by the compilers in situations
that seemed significant. We know that chance meetings were
considered omens, so perhaps bits of overheard conversations by
strangers would have been included. Some sources may have been
particularly charismatic so that any utterance of theirs would have
been assumed to have meaning, however obscure. Such thinking
is commonplace today. For example, banal words spoken by a
cult leader are often considered significant by disciples. To give a
literary example, lines of Ezra Pound’s Cantos, though seemingly
gibberish, are thought to have meaning because of the genius of the
poet (however despicable his character). The same is true of works
by Shakespeare and many other authors.
    It is likely that many of the sources were professional diviners
(possibly the true “oldest profession”), or “cunning” women or
men, but probably not all. They need not have been literate. Some
may have been court officials, others may have been farmers or
soldiers. The prognoses, such as “ominous,” or “beneficial to ford
the great river,” were probably standard expressions that might
be affixed by the compilers—who may not have been the ones
who collected the phrases. Not infrequently the prognoses do not
seem to fit the rest of the line text. Perhaps they were sometimes
simply placed to fill in lacunae, as is usual in performances of oral
material.
	             Before the birth of the author	                       59



   It is obvious that the diagrams must have existed before the
line texts became associated with them, yet it is likely that some
of the textual material was quite ancient and widely familiar. By
this hypothesis, once the diagrams were set at six lines, some
textual material would have been ready to hand or would have
been collected and inserted to fill the line positions. It seems almost
certain that much of the divinatory material circulated orally
during the Shang. There might even have been earlier written
collections of them that were drawn upon to create the Zhouyi.
   In concluding this discussion of the composition of the Zhouyi,
I point to the admonitions of the Tang Dynasty Confucian
scholar Han Yu (769–824) who “would frequently reprove earlier
commentators for having attempted to impose a spurious order
and consistency on … mutually contradictory parts of the canon”
(Henderson 1991: 208).
   It would have been better if Han Yu’s advice had been more
often followed by I Ching commentators, all too many of whom
essentially rewrote the text to their own specifications. This
tendency to improve on the actual I Ching was not unknown in
traditional China and persists to the present day in such New Age
works as the I Ching for Lovers, the Toltec I Ching, and the pop
psychology of Carol Anthony and Hanna Moog. I have done my
best to translate the Zhouyi rather than create a new one.

       1. Commentary 乾 Qian Heaven
Qian originally meant dry. This fits with the lines all being yang
because dryness is one of the correlates of yang, actually the earliest
one. However, the word yang does not appear in the Zhouyi, nor
is there anything related to dryness in the text associated with
this hexagram. The usual translations of Qian, such as heaven,
or strong action, are based on its later cosmological associa-
tions. Hacker provides a table listing variant English translations
of hexagram titles, with a useful itemization of his criteria for
selecting the most suitable version (1993: 42–63). As with many
of the hexagram tags, a single English word cannot capture the
multiple associations of Qian.
   In Mawangdui the tag of this hexagram is 鍵 Jian, a near
homophone, meaning latch pin (Shaughnessy 1998: 38f., 287).
One can speculate, though without any actual evidence, that
the Jian variant came earlier and was later changed to the
homophone Qian to fit the later cosmological meaning of this
hexagram. I have kept the standard translation as heaven since
the line texts are clearly cosmological, unlike most of the other
Zhouyi texts.



The first four words of the Zhouyi
The phrase Yuan, Heng, Li, Zhen opens the Zhouyi and was
known to all educated Chinese. It would have been as familiar to
Confucians as the first words of Genesis, “In the beginning God
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                       65



created heaven and earth …” are to Jews and Christians, though
the meanings are in no way similar.
    In the Zhouyi this phrase is an invocation or introduction to the
act of divination. It proclaims, presumably to supernatural beings
such as ancestors, though the recipients of the sacrifices were never
specified, that their aid is being sought. Perhaps the intended recip-
ients of such messages would have been self-evident to Western
Zhou Chinese. They are not so to us. The second two characters
indicate that carrying out divination will be beneficial. This phrase
is ambiguous as to whether it means, “It will be of benefit to
carry out divination,” or “The divination will be favorable.” Such
ambiguity is common in the Zhouyi and readers could construe it
either way.
    The first character, yuan, could mean “begin” or “great.” Given
that this word does begin the divination, I have generally chosen,
“begin.” Also, given how often divination was carried out, it seems
unlikely that routine ones would require a major offering every
time. Indeed, the Zhouyi refers several times to small offerings.
    Kunst (200–11) notes that the term zhen is also frequent in
oracle bone inscriptions. There “beneficial” does not mean that
the prognostication will necessarily be favorable, but rather that it
would be prudent to divine for advice about the matter at hand.
After all, an unfavorable divination result might still benefit the
inquirer by warning about difficulties ahead.
    Heng, or “offering given (and received),” is the key character
in the judgments, appearing a total of forty-six times in forty-four
different hexagrams, indicating the necessity of making an offering
for the divination to be efficacious. However, in many cases the
formula is partial or abbreviated, with not all four characters being
included. Another variation is intercalation of other characters
within the invocatory phrase. With rare exceptions, the nature of
the offering is not specified. This is in contrast with the oracle bone
inscriptions, which are often quite specific regarding the animal to
be sacrificed.
    Later, perhaps in the Spring and Autumn Period, yuan, heng,
li, zhen came to refer to virtues. Since this was the era in which
Confucius lived we know that ethical philosophy was developing
at that time. There is also explicit moral discussion related to the
Changes in the Zuozhuan, notably in the famous anecdote of Lady
Mu Jiang. While this text is nominally a commentary on the Annals
66	                THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



of the Spring and Autumn, the date it reached its current form may
have been much later.
   Here are some examples of translations of these four words as
virtues:

      Wilhelm-Baynes (4): sublime success, furthering through
      perseverance.
      Lynn (130): Fundamentality, prevalence, fitness and constancy.
      Rutt (187): Goodness … excellence … right … kingpin of
      activity.
      	         (As spoken by Lady Mu Jiang in the Zuozhuan.)

In translating this phrase, as is often the case with Chinese ethical
writings, it is hard to identify specific English equivalents for these
rather vague terms. Rutt’s version seems most direct to me—
the phrase is a general statement implicitly commending being
virtuous. When these words are attributed to Lady Mu Jiang, they
are meant as self-criticism—that she lacks these virtues. This is the
earliest textual witness to moralistic reading of the Changes.
   In Western Zhou usage, zhen clearly meant something like
“determine” or “ask.” Etymology is thought to be from the
character for ding, a ritual cauldron and bu, to divine, a zodio-
graph for cracks on oracle bones (Boltz: 33, 54, 183). Thus
its early meaning was clearly, “to make a determination by
divination.”
   If one takes the later meaning of zhen as “correct” in the sense
of behaving properly (Kunst: 205), then the evolution of the term
seems straightforward: “determine what is correct by divination”
could come to refer to “correctness” of behavior as a virtue,
especially as the Zhouyi came to be regarded as a guide to morally
proper behavior. Once this character was associated with a virtue,
other virtues could be assigned to the remaining three characters.
Yuan as grand could easily refer to being exemplary in virtue, etc.
This etymology is clearly retrospective; that is, the virtue meanings
were added later, by editors intent on finding Confucian meanings
in the early classics.

The Qian dragon sequence
The first and second hexagrams, Qian and Kun, are the only ones
referring to dragons. In Qian, all lines except 1.3 refer to these
potent symbolic creatures. The reference to dragons in Kun 2.6 is
enigmatic—it has no evident relationship to the other lines. Since
dragon images are found on Western Zhou artworks, it is odd
that we do not find more of them in the Zhouyi. Also striking
about the Qian line texts is that they have a more definite thematic
organization than we find in most of the other hexagrams. These
attributes have led some scholars to speculate that the Qian line
texts are later additions from a time when the work was developing
cosmological meanings. This is plausible, although the substantial
similarity of the lines in the Mawangdui and Fuyang manuscripts
(these lines are damaged in the Shanghai Museum bamboo strips)
indicate that any such addition must have been quite early. No
other hexagram has such explicit cosmology in its texts. Kun,
despite its later representing pure yin, lacks any clear thematic
pattern in its line texts, nor does its mention of a mare have any
yin association.
   The Qian dragon imagery can be read in two distinct ways. As
expressed by Wilhelm-Baynes:

    The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged, dynamic,
    arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm. In
    winter this energy withdraws into the earth; it the early summer
    it becomes active again.

Setting aside Wilhelm’s reference to electrical charge, one of many
attempts to find modern science in the Changes, we can see the
dragon is a symbol of energy, at times latent, as in winter, at
other times active, as in summer. In this reading the texts refer to
seasons, but also more generally to the energies that may be active
or only potential in the situation divined about, but which need
to be taken into account in deciding one’s own actions. When the
forces are hidden, one had best to wait rather than undertake any
direct actions. This is a common life situation. A modern variant
is, “Don’t do anything until you have to.” This applies to many
areas of life: medicine, in which treatment decisions are postponed,
warfare, in which one must await accurate intelligence, business
68	              THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



etc. Timing of actions has always been a Chinese preoccupation,
as embodied in the concept of the sage whose essential ability is
perceiving incipience, seeing patterns in events before they become
apparent to ordinary people.
   Later, when the dragon is in the field or sky, one is able to sense
the very powerful forces acting upon one. This also corresponds
to the agricultural year—little work in the winter, intense work in
spring summer and fall. Energy here is subjective energy, not that
of modern physics.
   The other way to read the dragon imagery in Qian is astro-
logical, or as a reference to seasonal movements of asterisms (star
groupings). While the divinatory component of astrology is now
dismissed as a pseudoscience, we should not ignore the fact that
it has always involved accurate observation and calculation of
the position of stars and planets. Though there was always some
skepticism, large numbers of people have always assumed that
the stars affected destiny. Shaughnessy noted in his dissertation
that the baffling reference to “dragons without heads” appearing
in the sky as an auspicious sign actually refers to the position
of an asterism (1983: 268–87). Pankenier provides an extensive
treatment of dragon asterisms in the Zhouyi and other early texts
(2013: 38–80).

1.2 Now the dragon is visible, a decision can be made because the
forces affecting one are apparent. As often in life, the next step is
a meeting with a powerful person. Such meetings were best held
when the powerful person, who might have the power of life and
death, was in a good mood.

1.3 The meaning of the repeated 乾乾 Qian Qian seems unrelated
to the same character of the tag. Although this line lacks direct
reference to dragons it is related to the theme of activity. I
have translated this word as “energetically” to emphasize the
association of the all yang hexagram with energy, despite it being
unlikely to have had direct yang associations in the Western
Zhou. Rutt prefers “active,” because he feels it important to avoid
implications such as “work ethic” or “diligence” and the like
(292). Perhaps that is so, but hard work has always been necessary
for most of humanity. This phrase also seems to be a seed of later
ethical concepts.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      69



   One of the most famous phrases in Wilhelm-Baynes’ iconic
English version is 无咎 wu jiu. It is translated by Wilhelm-Baynes
as “no blame.” This cannot be an abstract ethical pronouncement
by an impersonal narrator because we do not find such in the
Zhouyi. In his English phrase it seems to mean getting away with
something. When it refers to human sacrifices, “no blame” seems
particularly bizarre to modern readers. Properly understood this
phrase is not so much an ethical judgment, as a verbal spell or
incantation to avert blame. This is important in any society, but in
a hierarchical one where irascible superiors with absolute power
could hand out harsh punishments on a whim, avoiding blame was
vital for survival. To give but one historical example, when a newly
enthroned emperor in the Han Dynasty was told that one of his
friends’ vulgar manner of speech detracted from his own prestige,
he had the friend executed.
   Many Anglophone readers are puzzled by the phrase wu jiu,
because it often follows phrases that do not suggest blame at all,
or that seem highly blameworthy, such as sacrificing captives.
Considering the phrase as a spell or incantation seems to me to
solve the problem—it would be especially important with just
those actions that are potentially blameworthy. This hypothesis
is consistent with the later oracle bone inscriptions that tend to
be charms intended to bring about a desired outcome, rather than
predictions. Consistent with this I have translated the phrase as
“blame averted” or “there will be no blame.”

1.4 Here it must be the dragon that leaps into the whirlpool.
Omission of the subject is usual in Chinese grammar, inference
from context being assumed. Dragons in later Chinese art are
regularly depicted among turbulent waves. These could also have
been covert sexual references because dragons are yang and
whirlpools represent intense yin energy. The divinatory meaning of
this line is clearer than many, referring to jumping into an intensely
chaotic situation, yet managing to avoid blame. In divination, it
would mean that the inquirer is in a tumultuous situation, but will
come out safely.

1.5 This completes the upward movement of the dragon from
underground upwards.
70	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



1.6 The usual translations are similar to Wilhelm-Baynes’ “Arrogant
dragon will have cause to repent.” This, however, makes no sense
as humility is not an attribute one associates with dragons. Hence
it is more plausibly an omen that a dragon high in the sky portends
regret, or more specifically, when read astrologically it means that
when the dragon asterism (the second of the Chinese Zodiac) is in
the second lunar mansion, there will be regret.

1.7 As discussed above, this refers to asterism positions and so is a
seasonal reference. For further discussion on dragon imagery, see
2.7 and related commentary.

          2. Commentary 坤 Kun Earth
Kun in the Wilhelm-Baynes translation means “earth” or “recep-
tivity.” The latter is likely based on the earth being receptive to
planted seeds. In the Mawangdui version, this is hexagram 33
Chuan, River or Flow (Shaughnessy 1985: 103, 302f.). It has been
suggested that flow here is a reference to female genitalia, comple-
mentary to the supposed phallic implication of the Mawangdui tag
for number 1, which is Jian (for Qian) as “latch pin.” Despite my
belief that there are likely many sexual references in the Zhouyi
that are no longer recognizable, this one seems implausible to me,
simply because there is little other genital symbolism. Sometimes
a latch pin is just a latch pin. For the extreme speculations that
have been advanced regarding Kun and possible variants, see Rutt
(295–6) and Bernardino (201f.).

2.0 The judgment text of Kun is the longest in the Zhouyi. The
reference to a female horse has been interpreted in diverse ways. If
one accepts the early meaning of 亨 heng as offering in the sense
of a sacrificial offering to an ancestor or deity, then the text ties
together as a narrative in which sacrifice of a mare will ensure that
it will be favorable to go somewhere. Rutt alludes to this possible
meaning of sacrifice but does not choose it for his translation.
This being a recommendation for sacrifice seems to me almost
inescapable, although a possible alternative is the mare being
served by a stallion for reproduction. In any case, nothing in the
text states that compliance or submission is specifically the female
role, despite later being interpreted in this way. Indeed, other than
the reference to a female horse there is no gender reference at all.
   The reference to service to a king suggests that the journey is
part of official duties. As always with the Zhouyi, one can propose
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      73



other meanings that are consistent with the wording: for example,
that going somewhere will be favorable if one is taken by a mare,
presumably pulling a cart as horses were not yet ridden in the time
of the Western Zhou. We should not assume in reading the Zhouyi
that only one possible meaning is correct. It is almost certain that
different readers or diviners understood the same phrases differ-
ently. Indeed, ambiguity is essential to the process of divination.
   The adolescent prodigy Wang Bi (226–49) took the mare as
a reference to female docility or compliance (Lynn: 142f.). This
reading has no basis in the actual text because, as I have empha-
sized, yin was not correlated with the feminine until centuries
later. Given the ambiguity of the Zhouyi, it was easy for Wang
Bi and many other commentators to add this reading to serve
the frequently misogynistic agenda of Confucian and other later
commentators. This later interpretation tells us nothing about
attitudes toward women at the time of the composition of the
Zhouyi.
   The text does hint that this is a time to be receptive and follow
the lead of others. The term junzi, orignally meant “prince,” but
later came to mean a cultivated or virtuous person. While it does
not specify gender, there is no doubt that junzi almost always
refers to a male. So here it is almost certainly a man who is being
counseled to act submissively. In a strictly hierarchical society, and
even in our own, there are many occasions when it is advisable to
yield to authority.
   That attaining a master or lord was desirable may seem strange
to a modern reader who values independence. However, in a feudal
society, if early China can be so termed, being without a master
was dangerous, as one would be without protection. Identity was
to a great degree dependent on belonging to a group, usually based
on family.
   I have translated the third and fourth phrases as “west
and south” and “east and north,” rather than “southwest and
northeast” as the prime directions were particularly important.
Directionality was a preoccupation in early cultures. Many divina-
tions indicate that good or bad fortune depends on the direction
of the activity. Divination about traveling often indicates safe
and dangerous directions. Given the dangers of traveling in that
remote era, selection of route would have occasioned considerable
anxiety.
74	              THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



    I have translated 安 an as “safe,” rather than “peace,” because
it is doubtful whether peace was a conscious value in early China,
considering that war was one of the great affairs of state. Instead
it seems to have been taken as a matter of course that states would
wage almost constant war upon one another.

2.1 That Kun follows Qian was regarded as significant because
after yang reaches its maximum, yin begins to rise, as the coming of
frost and ice indicates the coming of winter, the yin season. Keeping
in mind that in the Mawangdui version Kun does not follow the
first hexagram (not Qian but Jian), but is number 33 Chuang
or Flow, the placement of Kun as number 2 cannot be taken for
granted as the original one. If could be that as the Changes came to
be read as cosmological, this arrangement was made to accord with
the cosmology. Or it could simply be that there was more than one
organizing pattern for the hexagrams.

2.2 This is one of several lines in the Zhouyi that seem to have
overt, though vague, ethical content. “Straight, square, great, not
usual,” would seem to be inborn character traits. The phrase does
make sense if these are meant as personal qualities, although they
could refer to a road, mountain, or other geographical feature.
Rutt suggests they refer to the proper surveying of a field (294).

2.3 The first phrase is somewhat obscure. In imperial China,
courtiers held an object in front of their mouths so that their breath
would not touch the emperor. Whether such a custom existed so
early is not known. Alternatively, this could refer to placing a
piece of jade in the mouth of a corpse to prepare for burial. In any
case the jade object does have something to do with honoring or
respecting the king, perhaps when reporting a divination result to
him.

2.4 This line seems straightforward: if you tie something in a sack
it will be held securely and you will avoid blame, but since this is
normal practice it will not win praise. For divination it means that
keeping things secure will prevent blame, but not attain praise.
Rutt suggests, plausibly, that what is tied in the sack is grain,
making this a reference to the harvest (295).

2.5 The yellow lower garment likely had ritual significance, the
meaning of which is now lost, though speculative theories abound.
The divinatory meaning would have been clear: obeying ritual
requirements will get one off to a good start.

2.6 A striking, but obscure, image. An unusual feature of this line
is that it involves mythical creatures, while most Zhouyi imagery
is based on nature and daily life. Dragons are not necessarily
represented as fighting in Chinese culture, being symbolic of
positive energy. The meaning of black (or dark) and yellow blood
is also obscure, although yellow, as in the previous line, is an
indication of auspiciousness. It has also been suggested that the
colors referred to are not black and yellow but reddish brown
(Pankenier 2013: 54f. n.26).
    Wang Bi’s commentary suggests that black is yang/heaven and
yellow yin/earth. The problem with this is that the usual associ-
ation is yang equals bright and yin equals dark. Pankenier suggests
that the fighting dragons refer to a time of year when there are two
dragon asterisms visible on the same night, one after twilight; the
other before dawn, and so could symbolize yin and yang struggling
to overcome each other in late winter/early spring (2013: 54). This
is attractive, but the lack of evidence for yin-yang cosmology in
the Western Zhou makes it doubtful as the early meaning. It is of
course plausible that lines like this one, which seem to use imagery
unlike the rest of the text, are later additions. Yet another theory
is that the dragons are imagined as having sexual intercourse and
that the two colors of blood refer to semen and menstrual blood
(Lynn: 149f.; Rutt: 296). All that can be concluded is that this is
an instance of the fecundity of the Changes in generating peculiar
theories.

      3. Commentary 屯 Tun Gathering
Wilhelm-Baynes translation of the title, “Difficulty at the
Beginning,” is based on the first phrase of the judgment text and
imaginative reconstruction of the character’s etymology as a picto-
graph showing a blade of grass struggling to break through the
surface of the soil.
   However, in lines 3.2 and 3.5, tun clearly means gathering or
assembling, not initial difficulty. Furthermore 3.4 and 3.6 also
refer to gathering of horse carts. Indeed, to the extent that there
is a unifying theme in the line texts, it is about assembling for an
important occasion such as a wedding or granting of noble rank.

3.0 I have used the somewhat obsolete term “enfeoff” to designate
a practice no longer in existence—the grant of land and, usually, a
title of nobility, in return for military or other service. Generally,
larger grants of land meant higher titles. Wealth, until the rise of
trade, was mainly in the form of land; taxes were paid in rice.
Furthermore, this land supported the men who served the lord
as workers and soldiers, so bestowal of land also allowed the
nobleman to furnish soldiers to the ruler—though they could
as easily be used for rebelling against him. Grants of land also
served, not always successfully, to placate the powerful. This
meant feeding a monster—in all feudal societies, powerful lords
were a persistent threat to the rule, and often became de facto
rulers.
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     79



3.1 The second phrase repeats that of the judgment. Since it fits
better with divination about a home, this is likely the correct
placement and the inclusion in the judgment a scribal error
(dittography). In any case, such errors do not significantly affect
the meaning.
   “Not useful if having far to go,” seems odd in English. However,
the meaning is clear enough—traveling to a distant destination is
not useful under the circumstances divined about. The Zhouyi has
many such references to anxiety regarding travel.

3.2 Though 乘馬 cheng ma together can mean mounting or
riding a horse, it is generally thought that horses were not ridden
until the Spring and Autumn Period. Hence the meaning is likely
riding in a horse cart. This line refers to the custom of mock bride
stealing. This was a ritualized re-enactment of an older custom in
which men from another village would attack and abduct young
women to serve as their brides. Later such weddings were actually
pre-arranged.
    While this is the most likely reading, 匪 fei can also mean
bandits or brigands and 媾 gou sexual intercourse, so it could refer
to abduction and rape by brigands. One cannot help but wonder
if it was read both ways, sometimes as a wedding ritual, others as
a salacious episode.
    Later commentators from Wang Bi, to Richard Wilhelm’s
late Qing-educated informant, Lao Nai-hsuan, took 貞zhen as
a reference to a woman maintaining her chastity for ten years
until she is ready to marry; that is, giving her word zi 字 (Lynn:
154; Wilhelm-Baynes: 17f.). However, zi can mean “word” or
“conceive.” Using the former, it would suggest that the woman
had some ability to make her own decision regarding marriage
(Redmond and Hon 2014: 84). If one takes the latter, it means that
she marries but does not become pregnant until ten years. In such
a case a diviner saying that she would eventually become pregnant
would benefit the woman—those who did not attain pregnancy
soon after marriage were often harshly treated. Another possible
meaning, not noted elsewhere, would be that the woman was a
child bride and not able to consummate the marriage until she is
ten years older. Ambiguity of this sort is frustrating, particularly
here, because we would like to know what the passage is telling us
about early Chinese marriage customs.
80	               THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



    In pre-modern times, children were the only source of support for
most elderly parents. As human reproduction is always uncertain
divination was frequently sought regarding when a woman would
conceive, whether gestation would proceed safely, and whether the
child would be a boy or a girl. An oracle bone inscription in the
Museum of the Institute of History and Philology in Taipei, now
much quoted, predicts the queen will give birth next week to a boy,
only to later state, “Disaster, it’s a girl.” A mother might be blamed
if she gave birth to a girl. That it is the male sperm that determines
the sex of a child and that at least 10 percent of infertility is due to
male factors were, of course, unknown.

3.3 For a deer to approach without fear would be an anomaly;
hence this is an omen. Given that the event is abnormal, the deer will
perhaps not be killed, since doing so might be inauspicious. There is
no evidence of compassion for animals in the Zhouyi, though there
are hints of it later in the Lunyu and Mencius. Sparing the animal
would be related to supernatural concerns, not compassion.
   I have translated 虞 yu as “fear,” but an alternative early
meaning is gamekeeper—either way the animal’s approach is
abnormal. For 無 some editions read the simplified equivalent 无
but this makes no difference in sound or meaning.

3.4 媾 gou, translated discretely by Wilhelm-Baynes as “union,”
seems to refer here to remarriage but can mean “sexual intercourse.”
As I have commented elsewhere, the paucity of references to
sexuality in the Zhouyi is surprising, as they are common in the
詩經 Shijing (Book of Songs) and the 楚辭 Chu Ci (Songs of the
South).

3.5 The reason fat is avoided now is also the reason it was valued
in earlier times—its high caloric content. When food supply was
uncertain and many suffered from inadequate nutrition, high
caloric foods were of greatest value. Even in the West, high fat
content was integral to gourmet cooking until recent decades.
When animals were sacrificed in ancient China, the meat was
distributed according to social rank. Fat might be a reward for
soldiers and others in attendance.
   Kunst comments that xiong 凶 is “the most inauspicious
prognostication used in the Yi text” (190f.). Given the uncertainty
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     81



as to which matters are minor and which major, this prognosti-
cation cannot but be correct. It does offer actual advice, however,
specifically to focus on less important matters for the time being.
Thus room is left for optimism, something that characterizes
Chinese culture from very early, despite the harshness of Bronze
Age life—the risk of mass starvation with a bad harvest, bandit
attacks, and arbitrary infliction of punishments. Thus, although 凶
xiong ominous appears fifty-seven times, 吉 ji auspicious appears
142 times. Of course, favorable prognostications are good for
business for diviners.

3.6 The horse carts here may be ranked for a burial. Expressing
grief appropriately in a prescribed manner has always been a
preoccupation in China. Proper mourning is essential to the
ordering of society. As expressed by Confucius, “Tend carefully
to death rites, and pay reverence to those long departed, and the
people will in the end be rich in virtue” (Lunyu 1.9; Watson: 17).
   For an innovative alternative translation I am indebted to
Mingmei Yip who proposes that it refers to a bride abduction. The
woman resists for ten years and weeps tears of blood, but after ten
years she accepts her situation. Several well-known anecdotes of the
Han describe women bitter over being sent to marry a barbarian
who eventually come to appreciate their wealth and comfort.

       4. Commentary 蒙 Meng Neophytes
In translating this hexagram, I have generally followed the reading
of Wilhelm-Baynes, making it about children or youth. I have trans-
lated the tag as “neophytes” which has the advantage of also meaning
sprouts. This seems a better fit than “immaturity,” a psychological
concept almost certainly absent in the Western Zhou.
   Kunst, Rutt, and Minford (528) translate the tag and other
occurrences of 蒙 meng as “dodder.” This is derived from a
suggestion by Arthur Waley (1933) that the character refers to
a parasitic plant that grows on bushes (130f.) While the British
scholar does quote a single obscure source for this usage of the
character, to me his reasoning is entirely unpersuasive:

      It was not I who sought the stripling dodder; the stripling dodder
      sought me is clearly a spell for averting the evil consequences of
      tampering with the holy plant. (131)

This is a clear instance of the tendency inspired by the Doubting
Antiquity movement to substitute far-fetched meanings for received
ones that are quite clear. That a plant seeks someone is self-evidently
absurd, particularly as the sacredness of parasitic plants is not
attested in any Chinese text, at least of which I am aware. This
is doubly unfortunate because as translated by Wilhelm-Baynes,
Meng is one of the most easily understood hexagrams. Although
Waley was one of the greatest translators of Chinese and Japanese
texts into English, he was not an infallible one, having a penchant
for replacing obvious meanings with obscure ones.

4.0 Here three of the four characters of the invocation are present
although embedded within other phrases. It is possible that in
practice these four words began every Zhouyi divination, but
were sometimes omitted from the written text. This is consistent
with what is known about texts based on oral material. The
character 亨heng, offering, seems to be the key one in this
phrase, as the offering would have been essential. The questioning
referred to can be read either as students asking a teacher or as
an inquiry addressed to the Zhouyi. (To divine about the same
question repeatedly would almost certainly generate contradictory
prognostications, hence the need to discourage this.) Nonetheless,
divinations tend to be done repeatedly over the same question,
presumably in the hope of greater clarity and accuracy, or a better
prognosis.
   We do not know where inquirers in the Western Zhou believed
the answers to their requests for divination to have come from. It
seems to have been taken for granted that the classic would give
valid answers. Oracle bone divination is assumed to have been
addressed to ancestors or spirits, although not all scholars accept
this hypothesis. So it is plausible that the Zhouyi was similarly
regarded. If this surmise is correct, this passage could refer to
repeated questioning of ancestors, who according to Chinese belief,
were more irascible after death than before. At some point, the
I Ching became regarded as a sage in itself, as it still is in the minds
of many of its practitioners.

4.1 Physical punishment of young children, often harsh, has been
routine in most of the world until quite recently. Supposedly the
character for father 父 fu represents the belts with which the father
disciplines his children. Although this etymology is likely fanciful,
it illustrates an assumption about the role of paternal figures in
child-raising.
    A child or student speaking out would not seem to merit
punishment, but teaching in traditional China did not follow the
modern way of students asking questions; rather, students listened
silently, or recited what they had memorized. The relationship
between teacher and student was rigidly hierarchical. While
memorization is now out of fashion as uncreative, we should keep
in mind that China’s mode of education has maintained its literary
culture essentially intact for more than two millennia.
86	              THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



   Harsh punishment of children unfortunately continues to be
usual in much of the world. (Modern research on child devel-
opment suggests that physical punishment of children results in
worse behavior. This is not surprising—fear disrupts attention.)
   Rutt translates line 1 as being about punishment, presumably
of criminals rather than children, as does Shaughnessy (2014: 73;
1996: 62f.).

4.2 My translation that this means bundling up a child, presumably
against cold, is at best a guess, perhaps because I would like to find
some evidence of nurturing behavior in the classic.

4.3 Has been interpreted as advising a man not to marry a woman
who sees a “man of bronze” or “man of gold” and loses her
self-control. In modern slang it would mean one should avoid
a woman who is a gold-digger. The text refers only to seeing
this man, not to any behavior on the part of the woman, so this
usual translation seems to me to miss the nature of this line. Nor
do we find much in the way of this sort of character description
of women, or of men, in the Zhouyi. Such seemingly obvious
attributes as greed, selfishness, and laziness, do not appear in the
ancient text. Since 夫 fu can mean a man of low rank, a commoner,
this is likely an omen—seeing a man doing forced labor is a sign
that it is not auspicious to choose a wife. (Mea culpa: I got this
wrong in my prior translation in Redmond and Hon [2014: 84].)
I have translated the second phrase to state that not bowing will
keep one from advancing, undoubtedly true in pre-modern China
but whether this is really the early meaning is no more than a guess.

4.5 In context, it is likely that seeing a young person was an omen.

4.6 This line has a clear divinatory meaning—in this situation, one
should not attack but defend.

         5. Commentary 需 Xu Waiting
需 Xu can be translated either as waiting or getting wet, both being
universal life situations. Getting wet better fits several of the line
texts and is supported by the Mawangdui manuscript, which has
a different tag character, thought to be a homophone for “moist”
(Shaughnessy 1997). “Getting wet” also accords with the top
element of the graph, the radical, which means rain. In the line texts
I have departed from my usual principle and translated it both ways,
based on context.

5.0 This is the first hexagram in which the phrase 有孚 you fu
appears. I have translated it throughout as holding captives.
Often, as here, this is considered auspicious—for the sacrificers,
not the captives, of course. Blood sacrifice was near-universal in
the ancient world, particularly to propitiate ancestors or spirits.
In the received version this was translated as trust or sincerity;
the demonstration by the Doubting Antiquity philologists that
the early meaning was captives to be sacrificed was of central
importance in their transformation of traditional readings of the
classic. While it has been suggested that this practice was abolished
in the Zhou, archaeological evidence refutes this, although the
practice gradually diminished.
   Confucianism dealt with blood sacrifice by averting their
attention. The Master frequently expressed admiration for the
“ancient rites” without reference to their essential component
being killing. There is one exception in which he defends the
practice to a disciple by stating, “you care about the sheep. I care
about the ritual” (Lunyu 3.17; Watson 28). Mencius also refers
to the smearing of the sacrificed animal’s blood as the validation
event of the rite, despite his admonition elsewhere to stay away
from the kitchen, lest the miseries of animals being butchered spoil
one’s appetite.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     89



   What are we to make of this unpleasant discovery about the
supposedly morally pristine Book of Changes? First, we must
accept that China’s very ancient times were far from idyllic.
Second, references to human sacrifice remind us that all cultures
find excuses for gratuitous violence. In the West, the execution
of Socrates, the witchcraft and heresy burnings, and many other
state-sanctioned murders are considered by some to be equivalent
to human sacrifice. Characteristic of human sacrifice is that the
victims are innocent but the killing is supposed to benefit society.
A familiar example is the sacrifice of Iphigenia to placate Artemis
and enable the Greeks to sail to attack the Trojans.

5.1 Kunst (249) and Rutt (298) take this line to refer to a specific
ritual, but since nothing is known about what this might have been,
I have left it simply as “sacrifice.”

5.3 Perhaps robbers would hide near mud as it would make it
harder for their victims to run away.

5.4 While Wilhelm-Baynes translated this line as advice for getting
out of a dangerous situation, this must originally have referred to
sacrifice. Blood flow was essential to the efficacy of the sacrifice,
as was the celebrants’ smearing on themselves. Attitudes toward
blood and other bodily fluids were quite different from modern
ones, urine being commonly used as a medicine, for example.

5.5 Wine and food were either for a feast or an offering, or both.

5.6 San could mean three or simply several, as Chinese uses
numbers to indicate approximate quantities. The best-known
instance is the ten thousand things, used in the Dao De Jing to
mean “myriad,” as in the famous line “The 1 became 2, the 2
became 3 and the 3 became the 10,000 things.”

“state,” consistent with it meaning a verbal dispute, especially a
legal proceeding. Litigation might be a better translation but I have
avoided it because of its connotation of a modern complex court
case.

6.0 Kunst and Rutt translate the first phrase as the captives laughing
nervously, taking laughing captives to be a favorable omen (Rutt:
298f.). Given the Zhouyi’s obsession with sacrifice of captives this
is plausible, but speculative. Of interest, phrases that include 有孚
you fu “holding captives” though they often refer to the terror
of the captives, usually do not directly mention the killing itself.
Rather than a prediction, the phrase seems to be an incantation to
bring about a favorable situation. Da ren 大人 or important person
often contrasts with 小人 xiao ren, meaning small or petty person,
that is, one of low character.

6.1 This is repeated from 5.2 and in context perhaps suggests the
dispute can be settled auspiciously with only a few words. The
next phrase suggests that the dispute can be resolved without
litigation.

6.2 Some read this as about someone taxing his fief of three
hundred households to pay a court judgment (Rutt: 299). “No
mistake” seems contrary to the other phrases of this text.

6.6 Belts were symbols of rank, as still seen in contemporary
Chinese images of warrior gods. This line may well refer to
a particular historical event. Absolute power makes rulers
capricious.

96	              THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



         7. Commentary 師 Shi Troops
I have translated as troops rather than army because the texts are
about organizing soldiers, not about the army as an overall entity.
This emphasis on proper position recurs frequently in the Zhouyi
and in the case of soldiers being readied for battle is obviously vital
for victory.
    The general meaning of this hexagram is clear—it is about
military organization and royal actions, presumably on the battle-
field. It notes that the fate of troops in different positions (center
and left) may be different. Corpses will be carried off the field in
carts—a disaster but inevitable after a battle. It is unclear if the
corpses referred to are the inquirer’s own soldiers or those of the
enemy. This chapter is more coherent than most, most lines being
connected to military matters, including 7.6, as fiefdoms were a
way of rewarding military success—and perhaps helping to prevent
a successful commander attempting a coup against the ruler.

7.0 I have translated ren as “people” as the term in Chinese is
gender neutral and there were some famous women generals in
early times, notably Fu Hao (婦好 died c. 1200 bce), the wife of
King Wu Ding (武丁 reigned c. 1250–1192 bce), famous from the
oracle bone inscriptions. While the term usually refers to men, I see
no reason to add gender when not in the original.

7.1 The phrase 以律 yi liu is translated by Kunst and Rutt, but not
Shaughnessy as pitch pipes. This is plausible, as music was used to
spur troops on to battle, but there is no evidence for this conjecture
and the emphasis on positionality in the Zhouyi text favors this
phrase referring to proper ordering of troops.
   Fou zang 否臧 is often translated as “not good” but zang can
also mean slaves, who served in armies, perhaps more in the Shang,
but in the Western Zhou as well (Sawyer 2013: 271, 379 n.882). It
might also mean that no enemy soldiers were captured to serve as
slaves. As captives were clearly auspicious, lack of captives would
be an unfavorable outcome.

7.2 The first phrase could also mean that for the soldiers it
is auspicious to be located in the center, or that this is best
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      97



for attaining victory. Ming 命 here is somewhat ambiguous. It
could mean giving orders but also granting life in the sense of
sparing people. In the context of organizing the troops, conferring
command seems most plausible.

7.3 Rutt and Kunst note the tradition, recorded in the 楚辭; Chu
Ci (Songs of the South) that King Wu’s corpse, or perhaps his spirit
tablet, was carried into the battle of Mu, the final defeat of Shang
by Zhou. They suggest that 7.3 and 7.5 may be referring to this
event (Rutt: 300; Kunst glosses 7.5.4). This suggestion is interesting
but not consistent with the ominous prognosis. Any battle would
result in dead bodies being carted from the field of action.

7.4 Whincup (1996: 43) notes that the left is the side of retreat,
thus interpreting the phrase as indicating that in this situation,
retreat is acceptable. This is plausible but the phrase may simply
mean that in the specific battle, it would be advantageous to
position troops on the left.

7.5 The first phrase might be a hunt to celebrate after a victory,
as Rutt suggests (300). Alternatively, it might mean that the
soldiers have to forage for their food and can find abundant game
in a nearby field. If the younger brother accompanies the dead, it
must be to honor someone of importance. Legends depicting dead
leaders carried into battle are not unheard of, the best known in the
West being that of El Cid of Spain.

7.6 Guo 國 is here somewhat ambiguous as to the size of the entity
founded. It could be a territory, a country or a dynasty. Rutt takes
this to be a reference to the founding of the Western Zhou (300). If
so, petty people might be those of Shang who did not accept their
new rulers. Alternatively, it might be a proviso that no low born
be enfeoffed.

8.6 Joining them without a chief, ominous.
上六比之无首, 凶.


          8. Commentary 比 Bi Joining
This is one of several hexagrams in which the tag character is
repeated in each line text. That this stylistic trait is found in only
a few of the hexagrams is consistent with the hypothesis that there
were multiple compilers who used different modes of organizing
the text fragments. Another characteristic of these line texts is
that they seem to lend themselves more directly to divinations than
many of the others.

8.0 Zhen 筮 is an interesting character, one of relatively few that
seem to have a clear etymology. On top is the bamboo radical,
perhaps referring to writing on bamboo strips; underneath is wu,
shaman, suggesting its connection with divination. An alternative
meaning for this might be that the initial divination by yarrow
is auspicious. This character appears only one other time in the
Zhouyi, in 4.0, as part of an admonition against divining about the
same inquiry repeatedly. We know nothing of the actual method
of using yarrow to select hexagrams or line texts, or even if this
was the original method of Zhouyi divination. There are frequent
references to divination by yarrow in oracle bone inscriptions,
but these precede the Zhouyi by at least two centuries. Given
the variety of divination methods attested in later writings, it is
virtually certain that there were many in use in the Western Zhou
(Redmond and Hon 2014: 19–36).
   Fu 夫 is usually a phase marker, but can refer to persons of
all sorts of social status, including conscripted laborers. In 4.3
seeing such a person is clearly a bad omen, as is the likely meaning
here.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     101



8.1 Fou 缶 could also be an earthenware percussion instrument.
This was a very ancient mourning practice. There is an anecdote
in the Zhuangzi in which the nominal author is admonished for
banging on a pottery jar following his wife’s death. This was a
symbol of returning to earth, perhaps originally to alert spirits to
the sacrifice about to be offered to them.

8.2 Nei 內 within could refer to any enclosure, particularly to the
women’s section of the house.

8.3 Feiren 匪人 could also mean brigands or criminals, but given
the inside/outside contrast here, foreigners seems a better fit. Kunst
points out that literally this means something like “non-persons,”
one of many Chinese terms disparaging those considered foreign.
Since China proper did not exist prior to the Qin, notions of
foreignness differed from later ones.

8.5 One example of many in which the prognosis has an unclear
relation to the preceding text. It does not fit with the rest of the
text. Here the king misses the game animals in front but the
people of the region have not been scolded. Yet it ends with 吉
good fortune, perhaps because the hunt is successful after that, or
because the beaters escaped blame.
   Implicit here is the importance of hunting for the king to demon-
strate his prowess. Rutt retells an anecdote related by Gao Heng in
which a king tries three times to hit a bird with his arrow. Blaming
a local for scaring the bird away, the king is about to have him
executed but his aide successfully pleads for him to spare the man.
Whether true or not it shows the absolute power of the king and
his eagerness to execute those who annoy him, however trivial the
offense. In another episode, a local chieftain is executed for being
late to a meeting, though this was presumably a pretext for getting
rid of a potential threat (Rutt: 301). These examples of the conse-
quences of offending royalty illustrate the extreme importance of
avoiding blame.

8.6 People joining together independently would be a threat to
those in power. Rutt refers to Gao Heng’s reading this as advising
the king and getting one’s head cut off for it (301). This was always
a possible consequence of giving frank advice. However, this
102	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



reading seems to me another instance of the Doubting Antiquity
movement’s adversarial attitude toward the ancient text. This
emendation is hardly necessary as the cruelty of the era is regularly
apparent in the Zhouyi.

104	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



         9. Commentary 小畜 Xiao Chu
               Small Livestock
Wilhelm-Baynes’ title is clearly too abstract for the Western Zhou.
Small livestock is literal and fits well with the society’s agricultural
nature. However, the only other references to anything agricultural
here are in 9.0, 9.2 and 9.6.

9.0 Rain was a matter of life and death for agricultural societies.
Hence the phrase “clouds but no rain” indicates a situation where
something important does not come as expected. In the oracle
bones, divination about whether it will rain is common. It could
also be a reference to sexual intercourse without ejaculation, an
expression of male anxiety about potency and fertility.

9.2 This means leading an animal and is the only line that directly
refers to livestock.

9.3 This sounds like a proverb, that spouses quarreling is like the
cart contending with the wheel. It is interesting because it shows
that wives were not as invariably obedient to their husbands as
later Confucian orthodoxy prescribed.

9.4 This line seems clear enough. Kunst (257), Rutt (232), and
Field (2015: 86f.) translate it as bloody castration of a horse or
goat, presumably to make the phrase a reference to agriculture.
However, since prisoners are being held and 有孚 you fu seems
only to refer to humans, it seems more probable that the phrase
is about the sacrifice of prisoners. That blame was avoided would
suggest that the manner of the sacrificial ritual was correct.
Sacrifice done improperly could annoy the spirit entities it was
intended to propitiate. As elsewhere, there is no suggestion of any
compassion for the victims.

9.5 Rutt suggests that a negation was lost, so that it should mean
“not wealthy because of their neighbors.” Either seems possible as
rich neighbors might bring overall prosperity or appropriate the
wealth of those less fortunate. The divinatory meaning would be
that being around rich people would bring opportunities for profit.
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    105



The term translated as neighbors 鄰 lin referred to a five family
organizational unit in the Zhou. Government has always intruded
into domestic life in China.

9.6 Kunst (256f.) and Rutt (232) translate the second phrase as
being about planting seeds. De 德 might refer to their potency to
grow into crops.
    In the final phrase, it is specifically the high born or upright
who are in peril. Early Chinese astrology regarded the position of
the moon, rather than its degree of fullness, as affecting good and
bad fortune (Pankenier: 492–4). Here the moon reference seems
to be simply a time marker. In passing, it should be noted that the
still prevalent Western association of a full moon with insanity
(“lunacy”) has been completely refuted by scientific studies.

10.6 Observing, treading, examining are propitious. Their turning

上九視履考祥. 其旋元吉.



       10. Commentary 履 Lu Treading
Lu means walking or treading, the latter better fitting the act of
stepping on a tiger’s tail. The hexagram lines are about the risks of
treading—walking or traveling by foot. The character for this, 履
lu “treading” occurs in each line text.
   This is one of my favorite hexagrams, not only because it is
unusually lucid but especially because the image of treading on a
tiger’s tail is so memorable. This image must be a proverbial one,
though with variations as in the different line texts.
   The lines describe different results of stepping on the tiger’s tail,
but without evident progression in accord with the line position.
One is not bitten in the judgment, then is bitten in 10.3, but seems
to escape the situation in 10.4.
   Perhaps the offering is in gratitude for not being bitten by the
tiger, but more likely heng by itself stands for the full four-character
invocation as in 1.0. Heng appears in only seven of the line texts,
but thirty-nine of the judgment texts. Several of the line texts
address the anxiety evoked by any sort of journey, even a local
one. Meeting with a tiger or brigands while traveling have been
common tropes in later Chinese literature.

10.1 This line text is rather bland but in divination it would be
easily read as meaning that just walking along minding one’s
business will not incur blame. The Mawangdui manuscript has
錯 cuo meaning mistaken, instead of “plain silk.” Both fit well
enough, but like many of the other variants in excavated texts,
these do not change our fundamental understanding of the
Zhouyi.

10.2 As I have emphasized, based on study of oracle bone
inscriptions it is clear that many apparent divinations are actually
incantations intended to help bring about the desired outcome.
The first phrase about the road being wide and smooth may be of
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    109



this sort, a stock phrase for well-wishing someone embarking on a
journey, just as we say “Have a safe trip.”
   You ren 幽人, which I have translated as “confined person,” can
mean “prisoner” but also a secluded person or hermit. Whether the
seclusion is voluntary or not, the inquirer’s outlook is favorable.
The phrase also appears in 54.2.

10.3 This might be a proverb saying that despite limitations people
can still function. More likely, it is an expression for an anomalous
situation in which miraculous cures occur.
   The second phrase returns to the treading-on-a-tiger theme. In
this line it is proclaimed ominous, a masterpiece of understatement.
For divination, stepping on the tiger would be similar to the English
language situation of “stirring up a hornets’ nest.”

10.5 This line seems to advise that walking in an overly confident
manner can attract disaster.

10.6 A warning to be cautious when traveling on foot. It
recommends first observing, then walking, then checking an omen
only to be told to turn back.

         11. Commentary 泰 Tai Great
Wilhelm-Baynes’ translation as “peace” is problematic because, as I
have already pointed out, there is no evidence for a concept of peace as
a desirable state in the Western Zhou; rather, warfare was considered
normal. Rutt makes a similar point (303). Rutt and Shaughnessy
translate as “great” and “greatness,” respectively, which somewhat
fits with 11.1, but is not a general theme of the texts.

11.0 “The great arrive; the petty depart,” refers to those who
occupy government positions. The competence and probity of
officials has always been a major preoccupation of Chinese thought
and continues in the anti-corruption campaign of the current
president, Xi Jinping. Corrupt officials are dangerous to honest
ones because they fear that the righteous will expose them.
   Good and bad government was considered cyclical in Chinese
political theory. Sometimes the country will be run by the virtuous,
at others by the cunning and dishonest. The virtuous regimes are
usually ascribed to the remote past, notably the time of King Wen
and the Duke of Zhou, though no such idea appears in the Zhouyi
text itself.
   This cyclic notion is expressed in the Lunyu:

   When the Way prevails in the world, [the exemplar of the way]
   appears; when the Way is lacking, he retires. (Lunyu 8.13,
   Watson 55f.)

11.1 Cogon grass was used to thatch roofs and to wrap offerings.
This phrase is a reference to making offerings, but a more specific
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    113



procedure than implied by the recurrent 亨 heng. The same phrase
appears in 12.1. Since hexagram 12 is the inversion of hexagram
11, it is conceivable that they were composed together. However,
in Mawangdui, with hexagrams ordered by a different principle, 11
and 12 are 34 and 2 respectively.
   A remote possibility is that 茅 mao (cogon grass) actually referred
to yarrow for Zhouyi divination. However, the Chinese word for
yarrow does not appear in the Zhouyi, though it does in oracle
bone inscriptions and other early divination texts. Further against
the possibility that 茅 mao referred to plant stalk divination is the
lack of any reference to divination methodology elsewhere in the
Zhouyi. Hexagram selection techniques are, however, mentioned
in the Zuozhuan and the Ten Wings. The yarrow stick method
most widely used since the Song Dynasty was a reconstruction by
Zhu Xi (1130–1200), whose method is rather onerous.We have no
record of earlier methods.

11.2 Rutt (304) notes that crossing the He (which may or may not
be the Yellow River) is compared to grappling with a tiger in Ode
195.6. That the river is turbulent might be why gourds would be
needed for flotation. The second phrase makes this an image for
moving on and leaving friends behind, a common trope in later
Chinese poetry and particularly poignant in an era when travel was
arduous. The final phrase might simply be a set phrase, or may mean
that the travel is for an official appointment that will bring honor.

11.3 This line, uncharacteristically for the Zhouyi, raises the
possibility that some might sympathize with the captives about
to be sacrificed. This reminds us that we should not imagine
that everyone in ancient times was heartless. However, it is hard
to make this into a wider indication of early Chinese feelings
regarding human sacrifice. Rutt translates this phrase as:

    Be not anxious: there may be captives at the feast. Good Luck
    (234).

Which seems to mean that it would not be a real feast without
human sacrifices. As with so many variant translations of the
Zhouyi, this cannot be refuted, but neither can it be proven to be
the early meaning. My personal feeling is that this is one of those
114	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



instances in which Rutt’s unrelievedly grim reconstruction of the
Changes goes too far. The Western Zhou was a cruel era, but surely
sometimes pity arose.

11.4 Regarding wealth and neighborhood, this is the negation of
8.5. It may be a continuation of the practice, pervasive in the oracle
bone inscriptions of making an inquiry by stating the question in
both positive and negative ways.
   In the Shang, as in China today, neighborhoods were usually
made up of families who worked in the same trade such as bronze
casting, ceramic firing, etc. While it is tempting to regard the
influence of neighborhood as based on “networking,” it is more
likely that geomancy—the antecedent of feng shui—is what is
referred to.

11.4 The redoubled word pian pian can mean dancing, usually
elegant dancing by males. The dancing might be part of the
festivities referred to in 11.3 and 11.6. Alternatively, Rutt suggests
that the fluttering is that of birds, hence an omen (304).

11.5 The first phrase recurs in 54.5, also about a royal wedding in
which the bride is upstaged by a bridesmaid.

11.6 This line does not seem related to the others of this hexagram.

12.6 Inclined to bad.
First bad; after, happy.
上九傾否. 先否後喜.



          12. Commentary 否 Fou Bad
Fou 否 in modern Chinese means “no.” By itself it can be an
interrogative, but this is not usual in the Zhouyi. As the tag for
this hexagram, Fou has been translated as obstruction, standstill,
or simply bad. In the Mawangdui version, the character is 婦 Fu,
meaning wife, a near-homophone (Shaughnessy 1997: 41f., 288).
Since this is a poor fit for most of the lines, I have followed the
received version. Some lines of Mawangdui can be read as about
marriage or a wife, but for the others, especially 12.5 “wife” is
a poor fit. Another argument against the tag meaning wife is the
tendency of pre-modern Chinese texts to limit references to women.
Certainly, women are mentioned in the Zhouyi, but infrequently.
   This hexagram is the inversion of the preceding one, 11. Its
constituent trigrams are also heaven and earth, but with the former
on top. This was later interpreted as heaven and earth moving
apart, an unfavorable situation. The judgments also contrast with
the great arriving in 11, but departing in 12, to be replaced by the
petty.

12.0 One of the many sources of frustration in translating the
Zhouyi is the character fei 匪, which can mean either negation/not,
or bandit/brigand. This character is often found in Zhouyi phrases
about weddings which also include the character meaning woman
or wife. Which meaning one chooses for fei will drastically alter the
meaning of the phrase. In this case fei is followed by ren, “person”
匪人 so here it would seem to mean a brigand.

12.1 and 12.2. The mention of cogon grass and wrapping parallels
11.1 and 11.2.

12.3 Probably meat for a sacrificial offering. It would have been
eaten after the ritual; the deceased always generously left their food
for the living.

12.4 Here the divinatory structure is clear. The first line phrase
indicates an event, while the following one gives the prognostic—no
blame is involved. The next phrase gives a natural observation—a
field with birds—while the final phrase interprets this as an omen:
there will be prosperity.
    Regarding the second phrase, oriole is an uncommon meaning
but is attested in the earliest Chinese dictionary, the Shuowen. The
phrase is a straightforward omen, the bird indicating that the field
will be fecund. Although orioles may be unfavorable as omens
(Rutt: 306; Bernardo: 205) in this context they are favorable.
Wilhelm-Baynes translate 祉 zhi as blessing, an example of a
perhaps inadvertent injection of Christian language. Such a concept
is anachronistic for the Western Zhou.

12.5 The first phrase states that it is good to stand up to the bad
elements. Perhaps the next phrase means that the bad run away
when there is a righteous person in charge. Tying to a tree could
mean that the bad ones are captured and bound. More likely, it
was a procedure to avert bad luck, akin to a practice still popular
in temples in Japan. One’s fortune is provided on a slip of paper;
if unfavorable it is tied to a tree in the temple grounds so that it
remains there instead of accompanying its recipient.

12.6 Perhaps a proverb stating that a bad person is happier when
he or she reforms. Such direct ethical admonitions are rare in the
Zhouyi.

        13. Commentary 同人 Tong ren
                Assembling
Wilhelm-Baynes’ title as fellowship with men misses the tone—
much of this text is about assembling for military purposes. It is
not about friendship or peace. As before, I have avoided specifying
gender in translating the genderless ren.
   The texts in this hexagram are relatively coherent. Gathering is
translated by Rutt as “mustering,” and does in this chapter usually
refer to soldiers. However, mustering is a formal process of getting
soldiers into position and the lines refer to more general forms of
bringing soldiers together.

13.0 This is another example of how the judgment text includes
three of the initial four words of the classic. The first word, yuan 元,
is omitted—it is the least important word of the phrase. The other
three words are in order, but with other words intercalated. The
reason for these variations in the invocatory phrase is unknown,
most likely scribal whim.
   While junzi here probably refers to a sovereign, or someone
of high rank leading the army, I have translated it as “upright
person,” as a reminder that high rank was assumed to correlate
with good character, a claim common throughout cultures, though
fallacious in all.

13.2 The reason for shame and regret is not apparent. Perhaps
assembling at the ancestral temple was to atone for an error of
some sort.

13.3 Jupiter was the “year star” because its passage across the sky
took one year. In the absence of the light pollution that is pervasive
in modern urban life, the phenomena of the night sky would be
apparent to everyone and seasonal changes would be general
knowledge.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     121



   It is hard to imagine that an attack on an enemy’s hill position
would last for three years, so more likely there was a siege, or
repeated attacks over a long duration. Failure to capture a fortified
position would have been a common military situation; this line
might be a fragmentary record of an actual campaign.

13.5 First wail, then laugh, recurs in reverse order in 56.6,
suggesting a set phrase that could be used either way to indicate
a sudden change in how one’s situation is perceived. The phrase
refers to prisoners about to be sacrificed in 43.0, 45.1, and in other
line texts. In context it seems to indicate intense emotion, usually
negative.

14.6 It is the way of things that heaven helps the lucky.
Nothing not beneficial.
上九自天祐之吉. 无不利.



         14. Commentary 大有 Da You
                Abundance
Da You literally means “great having”; that is possessing a lot,
or abundance. Wilhelm-Baynes’ “possession in great measure” is
appealingly mysterious but not quite clear. There is nothing specifi-
cally about abundance in the texts, though avoiding bandits, the
large cart, the duke’s offering, and heaven helping the lucky can be
related to the tag.

14.1 This is a highly ambiguous line. I take the first phrase as a
set phrase to the effect that if catastrophe is coming it cannot be
averted. This is similar to Kunst’s reading as interpretation of a
bird flight omen (267). Then brigands take the blame and are
punished. This manages to make sense of a confusing passage,
something other translators seem to have struggled to do. If 匪 fei
is taken as “not” as most have done, then the phrase becomes “not
blamed for the difficulty.” Jiao 交 can also be translated as sexual
intercourse, which would make the phrase, “There is no harm in
copulating.” This spices up the text, but it is hard to be certain if
this was an intentional double entendre.

14.3 This alludes to the advantages of wealth and power. It is
most likely a proverb, meaning that rich people can curry favor,
but ordinary people cannot. There is nothing remotely like social
criticism in the Zhouyi, although it is abundant in later classics,
such as the Lunyu, Dao De Jing and Zhuangzi.

14.4 As elsewhere I have chosen to translate 匪 fei as bandits when
this gives a clear narrative meaning to a phrase. Fear of bandits was
pervasive during most of Chinese history. Peng 彭 can also refer to
a kind of sacrifice (as translated by Kunst and Rutt) or a city in the
ancient region of Chu.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    125



14.5 That the captives were terrified would have been taken as
confirming the power of the captors, presumably the Western Zhou
rulers. The extreme suffering of the victim likely enhanced the
efficacy of the sacrifice. Mutilation was often part of the procedure
and execution methods were gruesome.

14.6 A proverb, though my translation is somewhat free. Like
the earlier proverb about dukes, this expresses a down-to-earth
realism. In a feudal state one’s life was mainly determined by the
status one was born into, a matter of luck.

15.6 A modest bird calls.
Beneficial to set soldiers marching on a campaign against the
capital city.
上六鳴謙. 利用行師征邑國.



       15. Commentary 謙 Qian Humble
The usual translations of 謙 qian are “modesty” and “humility.”
However, given the limited description of character traits in the
Zhouyi, I take qian as referring to behaving humbly; that is, as a
description of social status or behavior, not as an abstract virtue.
In a hierarchical society, acting humble in the presence of those of
higher rank would have been essential for survival.
   Kunst translates the tag character as Rat and Rutt does so more
precisely as the Great Grey Hamster—not the pet but a large and
voracious rodent [309f.]. If this is correct, then the lines become
a series of omens based on animal sightings or behavior. The
Mawangdui manuscript has qian 嗛 meaning modesty, but also
animal jaws. The Shanghai Museum manuscript qian has a different
character (not available in standard fonts), which Shaughnessy
translates as “modesty” (84). I regard the rodent translation as
another example of the Doubting Antiquity Movement’s preference
for rendering the classic as obscure as possible. Translation of the
tag character as Rat seems to have a debunking motive, because
this is one of the most explicitly moralizing chapters in the entire
Zhouyi.

15.0 High-born person seems better here than “upright person,” as
carrying out ritual was important for rulers and nobles.

15.1 My rendering makes the line into a proverb—some things
must be done by the high-born as well as the humble.

15.2 Also an edifying proverb. Even mere birds can provide
guidance. In this and other line texts of this hexagram are hints of
something like egalitarianism, not negating rank, but suggesting
that all are subject to human limits.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    129



15.3 This line is akin to 15.1. Even the high-born should work
hard with a humble attitude. Confucianism also extolled humility,
though not all Confucians have displayed this quality. While
Confucius speaks in an authoritative voice in the Lunyu, much of
what he says does display humility.

15.5 “Not wealthy on account of one’s neighbors” also occurs
in 11.4, indicating that it is a set phrase. It might have to do
with what we call networking, or geomancy, or perhaps that the
neighbors are stealing, likely a common situation.

15.6 The bird-call indicates that the outlook for the military action
will be favorable. In ancient Greece also, military decisions were
made on the basis of divination.

16.6 Murky. Preparation accomplishes change.
Nothing blameworthy.
上六冥. 豫成有渝. 无咎.



       16. Commentary 豫 Yu Preparation
The great variety of proposed translations for this tag, Yu 豫,
provides a good example of the imagination exercised by trans-
lators of the Changes. Suggestions have included enthusiasm,
contentment, joy, weariness, and elephant. The latter is that
of Kunst based on a Shuowen definition and followed by Rutt
(310). Given that the line texts generally do not suggest joy or
contentment, preparation seems the best fit—divination, after all,
is about being prepared.
   In the Shanghai Museum manuscript the tag is 余 and in
Mawangdui it is 餘; both translated by Shaughnessy as “excess”
(2014: 86 n.1). Lynn translates the tag as “contentment,” but then
puts it in a rather colorful phrase that does not seem consistent
with the style of the Western Zhou text:

   If one allows one’s contentment to sing out here, there will be
   misfortune. (236)

16.0 As already noted, enfeoffment, establishing nobles by a grant
of land, was the main way that a king could reward and retain
the loyalty of those who had helped him. The term I have used to
translate comes from medieval England.

16.1 Kunst and Rutt amend 鳴 ming to “elephant.” Given the
frequency of bird-call omens in the Zhouyi, I have stayed with the
received translation. Most bird-call omens in the Zhouyi, unlike
this one, seem favorable (15.2, 15.6, 61.2).

16.2 Presumably this refers to rocky terrain that delays the progress
of troops.

16.4 Translations of the last phrase, peng he zan 朋盍簪, have
varied considerably. Mine is the mainstream. Kunst and Rutt take
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     133



朋 peng to mean “cowrie shells,” which were strung together
for use as money. Wilhelm-Baynes translates this as hair-clasp.
Literally the final character refers to a hairpin, which Wilhelm-
Baynes explain as a metaphor for gathering together. That the
phrase is about friends gathering seems most likely to me given the
frequency in the Zhouyi of references to people gathering together.

16.5 Such a specific medical prognosis is unusual for the Zhouyi.
It states the illness is chronic but will not be fatal. There are many
medical conditions to which this might apply. How physicians of
the time could provide such a precise prognosis is unclear but some
would likely have some intuitive sense of disease and its outcome
from long experience. Despite this, many divinations regarding
disease must have been inaccurate.

16.6 This is a difficult line to make sense of. It might refer back
to the previous line—preparations had been made for the death of
the ill person, then changed when it was realized that death was
not imminent. This makes sense of the lines but is no more than
my guess.

Most of the lines in this hexagram concern captives and their
sacrifice. The tag could refer to pursuing people to take them
captive, as in 17.4. The texts are both unpleasant and uninter-
esting, merely adding some more references to human sacrifice.

17.0 The judgment is a standard invocation.

17.1 We are not told how the officials changed their mind, but it
was beneficial for the inquirer.

17.2 and 17.3 In the first case, the older captives are released, in the
next, the younger ones. This suggests that some sort of principles
existed for choosing sacrificial victims, but what these were is never
directly stated.
   The remaining line texts repeat the theme of human sacrifice.

   18. Commentary 蠱 Gu Sickness from
            Sexual Excess
The character 蠱 gu has multiple meanings, mostly ominous. That
selected by Wilhelm-Baynes, “work on what has been spoiled,” is
based on the structure of the character. The bottom element means
“bowl,” while the top means worms or insects. Thus the image is of
a bowl of spoiled food infested with vermin. This must have been an
extremely common sight in a world without refrigeration or insecti-
cides. This sort of etymology by breaking down characters into their
constituents has always been extremely popular in China, but is
frequently historically inaccurate. Furthermore, dissecting characters
is a quite different mode of interpretation than considering actual
usage of the word. Here, however, the etymology is entirely plausible.
   The Mawangdui text (Shaughnessy 1997: 68–9; 295) uses a
different character meaning “branch” for Gu (not available in
standard fonts), and clearly a homophone substitution for the
received version character.
   The tag character is repeated in five of the six lines, so it is
clearly the basic subject of the chapter. The exception is the final
line, which is unrelated to any of the themes in the other lines. The
line texts associated with the gu hexagram are of particular interest
for what they tell us about the anxieties of traditional China. I
have interpreted gu as “disease due to excessive sexual activity,”
a definite meaning of the word. This is specifically mentioned as a
diagnosis in the Zuozhuan, as translated by Rutt:

   Men who often women woo
   Suffer a disease called gu,
   It is not demons, is not gluttony:
   This weakness is brought on by lechery. (191)
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    139



There are many mentions in later Chinese literature of disease
brought on by excessive sexual activity. Only males seem to sustain
this disease, not their partners. According to modern medical
research, more frequent sexual activity, though it may be tiring,
is associated with better health. For a more detailed discussion of
Chinese attitudes toward sexuality and health, from the Zuozhuan
onward, see Leo (2011: 165–76 et passim).

18.0 The judgment text seems to present a positive prognosis
in contrast to the line texts, which indicate difficulties, though
these can be overcome with careful control of one’s behavior. The
character jia 甲 is the first of the so-called “ten heavenly stems”
of the Chinese dating system. It could mean beginning, as I have
translated, or an indication of which dates would be favorable
based on the Chinese sixty-day calendrical cycle. Hemerology,
that is, the determination of favorable and unfavorable days, was
and is pervasive in Chinese divination (see Kalinowski). Oddly,
while the Zhouyi often gives a prognosis, whether auspicious or
catastrophic, it is rarely specific about exact times or dates. Even
if the judgment is interpreted as providing guidance regarding
timing, it has no evident relationship to the line texts. Cyclic
date specifications are generally days for specific sacrifices to
be performed. (For further details on basis of sacrificial dates,
see Rutt [312f.]. For an introduction to the complexities of the
sexagenary cycle, see Wilkinson [2013: 496–502].) Three seems
to be a common number, for example, three years in 29.6, three
days in 36.1, three foxes in 40.2, and three people in 41.3. For
other examples, see 47.1, 49.3, 53.5, 55.6, 57.4, 63.3, and 64.4.
In context, three can mean several, but with reference to sacrifices
it must have been exact. No doubt three held numerological
significance, but lucky and unlucky numbers vary over time and
place. Currently, due to the worldwide influence of Cantonese
culture, four is unlucky because it is a homophone for “death,”
while eight is auspicious because ba, eight, sounds somewhat like
fa (cai), “to become rich” (for a concise discussion of Chinese
numerology, see Wilkinson [2013: 485–8]). Marshal suggests
that gu refers to an ancestral curse—this is not entirely different
from the effects of parental sexual malfeasance on the offspring
(Marshall: 128f.) Likely it had all these meanings in various
contexts.
140	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



    Lines one to five share similar tone and subject matter, suggesting
illness or another toxic situation related to the father or mother
that needs to be counteracted. As usual with the Zhouyi, the lines
are allusive rather than explicit, but the general message of the
first five lines is clear. One is faced with a potentially blameworthy
situation, but if matters are handled judiciously, the difficulties
can be minimized. Action is required, but should not be extreme.
The most obvious connection between the line texts is that all are
about family relationships, presumably in relation to reproduction
since the terms are not man and woman, but father and mother.
This makes it plausible that the illness has something to do with
sexual activity on the part of the parents—the inquirer seems to be
the offspring of the parents referred to. There is no suggestion in
the text as to what sort of sexual impropriety might be affecting
the offspring. Presumably it was excessive frequency. There was
no concept of perversions or paraphilias as in modern theories of
sexuality.
    Later Confucian exegesis tended to hide indelicacies by reading
them as moralistic lessons. Hence the sexual meaning of gu was
ignored. This suppression of sexual, or simply romantic, content
is even more evident in Confucian interpretation of the Book of
Songs (Shijing), in which love poems became expressions of the
admiration of the official for his superior.
    Gu had other unpleasant associations that were probably as
much in the minds of readers as the sexual ones. Spoiled food
infested by worms has already been mentioned—it was believed
they were somehow born from the food. For the many who barely
had enough to eat, spoiled food would have meant hunger and
economic loss. This reminds us that for most in the Bronze Age,
simple matters such as preventing spoilage of food were a constant
struggle.
    Gu also referred to a particularly evil method of poisoning.
Several venomous animals were placed in a vessel together. These
included snakes, scorpions, spiders, and centipedes. The last one
left alive was considered to have concentrated the venom and
was ground up and served to the victim concealed in food. Gu
poisoning, if it occurred at all, must have been rare. The greatest
harm associated with poisoning was probably not in actual use, but
false accusations. Like accusations of witchcraft, these were impos-
sible to defend against. Anxiety about health is always present in
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      141



human life, and was all the more so when there was no knowledge
of the actual etiology of disease, whose cause was often attributed
to poison or curses, both of which are invisible and impossible to
prove or refute. Although detection of poisoning was difficult until
it was too late, a variety of bizarre antidotes were recommended,
such as ingesting a different venomous animal to counteract the
one used to prepare the poison.
   For other views on the meaning of gu, see Kunst (1985: 274f.),
whose rendition of 18.4 refers to a “bathing father” and Rutt
(1996: 241, 312f.) who translated gu as “mildew,” based on the
much later Zuozhuan.
   In later China, pseudo-physiological theories of disease reached
great complexity, partially—but not completely—supplanting
supernatural etiology. These theories, making use of yin yang and
wu xing metaphysics, were already evident in the 黃帝內經素問
Huang Di Nei Jing Su Wen (Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic of
Medicine) (for a recent translation see Kong). The date of this
compilation is controversial; current scholarship assigns a Western
Han origin to it, though with inclusion of Warring States material
(Unschuld 2003: 1–7).

18.1 If a man has had a son, his improprieties are forgiven. The
responsibility to have sons was central in Chinese culture from
ancient times. Several translations of this line refer to the father as
being deceased.

18.2 This line indicates that the illness could come from the mother
instead of the father. However, whatever the mother has done, one
should not be too hard on her for it. This might be because of the
natural affection one has for one’s mother, or because women are
entitled to more indulgence. Wang Bi, one of the most influential
interpreters of the Changes gave a rather prejudicial tone to this
passage. As translated by Lynn:

    The nature of woman is such that she is incapable of perfect
    rectitude, so it is appropriate to suppress one’s own hardness
    and strength here … (1994: 251)

This is one of many misogynistic I Ching readings by Wang Bi. His
readings seem not to have been universally accepted since Legge’s
142	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



and Wilhelm’s translations, both based on informants who were
traditionally educated Chinese literati, simply render the line as
suggesting not to be too severe on one’s mother. Considering that
the father is mentioned more frequently regarding gu, there is no
indicating of greater blame for the mother in the Western Zhou
text.

18.4 In Chinese this line is ambiguous as to whether what would
be shameful was being too indulgent or too harsh. To be consistent
with the other lines, it most likely means that harshness would be
shameful. Such ambiguity would have given diviners much latitude
in what they told their clients.

18.5 According to this line, one will be praised for correcting what
the father did wrong. Such filial piety was laudable in ancient
China. Writing much later, Confucius famously said, “In our
district … a father covers up for his son; a son covers up for his
father. There’s honesty in that, too” (Watson 2007: 91).

18.6 This line text has no evident relation to the previous five.
It could be read as indicating that after overcoming the family
difficulties, one should focus on attaining higher goals for oneself.
However, the issue of serving a superior versus serving oneself is
not mentioned elsewhere in the chapter, so such a meaning seems to
be an effort at harmonization of texts that are unrelated.

       19. Commentary 臨 Lin Wailing
Lin 臨 has two quite different meanings. In ancient times it meant
wailing or keening as mourning practices (Kunst: 276f., 242; Rutt:
314). In Mawangdui the tag is a homophone 林, lin meaning
“forest,” as it is in the Fuyang version (Shaughnessy 1997: 108f.;
2014: 236). The commonness and simplicity of 林 is consistent
with it being a scribal substitution.

19.0 An unremarkable invocation.
   The line texts are simply variations on the theme of wailing.
   Initially puzzling in this hexagram are the lines that refer to
wailing, then declare it as auspicious—19.1, 19.2, 19.5, and 19.6.
Field explains this (as do Kunst and Rutt), as the lines being about
proper attention to the dead. After a phase in which the deceased’s
spirit wanders and is a danger to the living:
   Once the spirit resides in the tablet and mourning ceases, the
prognostication is a positive one: no harm will come (2015: 117).
   Here the harm would be from the ancestors’ restless spirit.
People feared the dead almost more than the living.

20.6 Observing their lives, upright people will not be blamed.
上九觀其生, 君子无咎.



       20. Commentary 觀 Guan Observing
Guan 觀 means “observe.” Much later, after the spread of
Mahayana Buddhism into China, it became the first syllable of the
name of the Bodhisattva Guanyin 觀音 (Sanskrit Avalokitesvara),
s/he who observes the sounds of the world. In Buddhist terms
it connotes observing with a wide perspective. In this Zhouyi
hexagram it refers to simple observation of ordinary events, unfor-
tunately including human sacrifice.

20.0 The sentence is confusing—Kunst and Rutt disagree as to
whether it means to sacrifice the captives or to not sacrifice them.
In either case, the text demonstrates that the physique of captives
was important in decisions as to when to sacrifice them. (This
phrase could also refer to captives who are tall, rather than ones
with big heads.) Suitability of victims was important throughout
the ancient world—one who was defective or deformed might be
an affront to the spirits. Apart from this line, the Zhouyi does not
have much to say about how victims were selected, other than
their being captives. This is in contrast to oracle bone inscriptions
and also the Baoshan, a divination text found in the Tomb of
Shao Tuo, who was buried in 316 bce, translated and analyzed by
Constance Cook (2006: 6, 47 et passim). In this later, less cryptic
text the nature of the victims to be sacrificed is specified in detail,
for example strips 207–8 recommend sacrifice of male pigs, a white
dog, and wine and food (Cook 2006: 168f.).

20.1 Children’s movements would have been omens. The theme
of petty people ascendant over the high-born or upright became
especially prominent in the Lunyu, Dao De Jing and other later
philosophical and ethical texts. This theme that the unworthy are
chosen for government posts remains pertinent today.

20.2 Peeking to observe likely refers to women being required
to remain behind a wall or screen, but it is uncertain to what
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    147



degree this repressive custom existed in the Western Zhou. I have
translated the second phrase to state that a woman performs the
divination, but the divination might have been about a woman,
rather than by her.

20.3 This could also refer to watching as a sacrificial victim paces
back and forth. I prefer the more reflective meaning despite my
reservations about direct philosophical expressions in the Zhouyi.
   A line in the much later Dao De Jing indicates that in early times
the roles of guest and host were precisely defined. When a guest of
a king, one must be particularly alert not to be displeasing. Rutt
raises the possibility that the guests might be sacrifices, but this
seems to be no more than an instance of his preoccupation with
this practice (315).

20.5/20.6 This is a proverb expressed in two forms to emphasize
that it applies both to oneself and others. This seems to be
encouragement that even the high-born should scrutinize their
behavior. As paraphrased by Wilhelm-Baynes:

    A man in an authoritative position to whom others look up
    must always be ready for self-examination. (85)

Proverbs are perhaps the earliest way of expressing wisdom.
Later, self-examination became central to Chinese ethical thought,
perhaps reaching its culmination in the philosophy of Zhu Xi,
often said to be the second most influential Chinese philosopher
after Confucius. Written nearly 2,000 years later, here is his more
sophisticated statement of the same idea:

    In all matters, examine into the right and wrong. Supposing you
    did something today; if you yourself are comfortable with it and
    have no doubts about it, it was the right thing to do. (Gardner
    1990: 183)

While one must be cautious not to read too much into the Western
Zhou texts, they do seem to recommend something akin to
self-examination.

Ominous.
上九何校滅耳. 凶.


       21. Commentary 噬嗑 Shi Ke Biting
                and Chewing
The first character of the tag is repeated in lines 21.2, 21.3, 21.4,
and 21.5. While the most obvious meaning is the literal one, biting
and chewing, shi ke might also refer to the flesh damage inflicted
by the torture devices of 21.0 and 21.6. This is perhaps the most
unpleasant of all the hexagrams, its violence being particularly
graphic. Even Wilhelm-Baynes could not find a way to soften it.

21.0 This phrase is rather incongruous. While it states that legal
proceedings will be beneficial, 21.1, 21.2, and 21.6 refer to the
mutilating punishments that could be inflicted as their result. While
tattooing and amputation were abolished in the Western Han, cruel
physical punishment persisted throughout imperial China’s history
and revived during the Cultural Revolution under Mao and the
so-called Gang of Four.

21.1 Treading 履 lu, is also the name of hexagram 10. That the
feet are gone might refer to them being hidden in the device, but if
it was tight enough to block blood flow, the feet would have been
severely injured or destroyed. Completely cutting them off was a
standard punishment. What happened to people rendered footless
is unclear. Many must have died from infection. Those who
survived would not have been able to walk, except perhaps a very
short distance with crutches and so would be entirely dependent
on others. The prevalence of such punishments is also unclear.
Zhuangzi states that if a man has no feet he need not worry about
shoes. This strikingly insensitive one-liner suggests he had perhaps
never seen anyone with this mutilation. One hopes it was rare.
   Wu jiu 无咎, there will be no blame, seems particularly incon-
gruous as used in this hexagram. Destroying feet or biting off a
nose hardly seem blameless. However, this formula appears in
conjunction with acts of sanctioned violence in many other Zhouyi
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    151



passages. That it was stated so frequently in such instances suggests
some sense that the act was wrong, or at least a need to defend it as
just. Nowhere in the Zhouyi do we find any direct criticism of state
violence. Mutilating punishments were not abolished until nearly
a millennium later by order of Emperor Wen (202–157 bce) of the
Western Han. This did not stop state torture, however. It needs to
be pointed out that gruesome public methods of execution were
also practiced in the West until quite recently (the guillotine was
last used in 1977) and continue to be inflicted in many parts of the
world. A further possibility is that the phrase is an interpretation
of an omen: that witnessing this punishment will not indicate bad
luck for the inquirer. The frequent placement of the “no blame”
phrase in such contexts is surely not random.

21.2 Perhaps “biting flesh” refers to the knife cutting off the nose.

21.3 With sacrifice, the fresh meat of the animal offered to the
spirits was distributed among those present. This was in accord with
social rank; the highest getting the choicest cuts. Here however, the
meat is dried, this being an essential means of preventing spoilage
in an era without refrigeration. It is not clear how one would know
the meat was poisoned, so perhaps this referred to its being rotten.
Divinatory meaning would then mean getting into a situation that
seems all right but actually is toxic.
   Poisoning was greatly feared because it was not usually
detectable. As discussed in connection with hexagram 18, perhaps
more common were wrong attributions of natural deaths to
poisoning. This often led to accusations against completely
innocent persons, akin to allegations of witchcraft and curses, all
of which could lead to execution. The veracity of such accusa-
tions was determined, of course, by divination. Thus diviners
might have the power of life and death. They were at high risk
themselves, should their divinations be erroneous or offensive to
those in power.

21.4 and 21.5 Finding an arrowhead in meat is plausible, as this is
how game would have been killed. It would normally be significant
as a favorable omen, though seemingly not in 21.5. Bronze
arrowheads would have had considerable value, because bronze
along with jade was one of the main forms of portable wealth.
152	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



Qian 乾, is the tag of the first hexagram but here has its usual
early meaning of dry, transliterated as gan. This character appears
in these lines in the Mawangdui silk manuscript, although there it
is not the tag of the first hexagram. Later, dry was one of the main
correlations of yang, but there is no suggestion of metaphysical
meaning here.

21.6 This refers to a common but cruel punishment inflicted in
China until the early twentieth century. It consists of heavy boards,
together weighing over 30 pounds, placed around the neck and
fastened together. Apart from public shaming, this prevented the
unfortunate bearer from feeding himself and so could be fatal
for those who had no one to help them. These highly visible
punishments were less likely to be applied to women, presumably
because putting them on display was disruptive.
   As elsewhere in the Zhouyi, the line order is approximately
anatomical with the base line referring to feet and the top line
to neck and ears. That the prognosis here is ominous is not
surprising, but it is odd that 21.1, which also refers to mutilation,
has a neutral prognosis. This suggests that the prognoses refer to
seeing the convicts as omens, not to the inquirer being subjected
to the various miseries described. It is usual with omens that the
divinatory meaning does not accord with its affective content.
For example, in the numerous apocryphal works with titles such
as The Duke of Zhou’s Manual of Dream Interpretation, a bad
dream is a good sign while a seeming good dream is unfavorable.
Perhaps this serves to increase obscurity so as to require an expert
in oneiromancy.

154	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



       22. Commentary 賁 Bi Adornment
Wilhelm-Baynes translate this word as “grace.” Adornment clearly
fits the texts better—they are about self-adornment, presumably
for a festival. Rutt is almost certainly correct in suggesting that
the festival is a wedding—these are frequently referred to in the
Zhouyi. Not only are weddings perhaps the most important of
all rituals of daily life, along with funerals they would have been
occasions for which divination was particularly important.
    Grace is a specifically Christian concept, though so infused in
world culture that it is often not recognized as such. The notion
of being redeemed by an external power has no counterpart in
early China. Wilhelm was a Protestant missionary and so would
naturally have been given to the use of Christian language, despite
his expressed lack of interest in converting Chinese. Interpretation
of Chinese classical texts in terms of Christian concepts goes
back to the figurist movement of the Jesuit missionaries in China,
notably Matteo Ricci (1552–1610) and Joachim Bouvet (1656–
1730). Figurism was an attempt to finesse the great gap between
Christian doctrine and Chinese religions with the hope, largely
unfulfilled, of facilitating conversion. As a result of the so-called
“rites controversy” this conception was eventually outlawed by the
Catholic Church.
    As the Changes has lent itself to appropriation by all sorts
of spiritual and philosophical systems, so it has at times with
Christianity. This is part of the value of the work but such adapta-
tions should not be confused with the early Chinese meanings.
Historically-based scholarship must consciously avoid this sort of
cultural anachronism. The reconstructed Western Zhou meanings,
as in the present translation, do not lend themselves to Christian
readings.

22.1 This could be a proverb to the effect that when at home, foot
transportation is sufficient, or a gesture of humility for a special
occasion.

22.4 The first phrase is difficult to render exactly. The final
phrase is another reference to the practice of sham bride stealing
at a wedding, a frequent theme in the Zhouyi, perhaps being the
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      155



custom of the source culture. Fei, though here meaning “not,” was
perhaps written as 匪 also meaning bandits, to emphasize the mock
abduction themes.

22.5 This admonishes against being too stingy with decoration,
presumably for the wedding.

22.6 This seems to contradict the previous line by implying that the
decoration is suitable. It might also be a proverb warning against
excess, lest it create jealousy. It could even refer to bringing lavish
items, while pretending they are modest.

158	              THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



         23. Commentary 剝 Bo Flaying
Bo 剝 contains the knife radical and clearly means flaying. Wilhem-
Baynes translate bo as “splitting apart,” and Lynn as “peeling.”
Neither is wrong on the face of it, but both are euphemistic.
Confucian propriety resulted in violence being treated euphemisti-
cally, if at all—not a bad thing but clearly not the practice of the
Zhouyi compilers. To fit with the tag, I have followed Kunst and
Rutt in replacing 牀 chuang as referring to the legs of a bed with the
near-homophone substitution of 牂 zang meaning ewe, consistent
with the contexts of the lines (23.1, 23.2, 23.3, and 23.4) in which
it appears (Kunst: 284f.; Rutt: 246, 317).

23.0 A set phrase prognostication, not related to the line texts.

23.1 Skinning of animals would have been an almost daily
sight in early agricultural societies. Subsistence farmers could
not afford to waste anything; animal skins would be a valuable
by-product of raising animals for meat. While exotic animal
skins were a means of conspicuous display of wealth, as they are
now, common animal skins would have been used for multiple
purposes, not only warmth but also military armor. Additionally,
there was a shamanistic element in which wearing the skin of a
particular animal was thought to confer the symbolic traits of the
species.
   The reference to starting at the foot suggests there might once
have been bodily progression in the subsequent lines, but this is
not carried out. The relation of the prognostic meanings to the act
of flaying or skinning an animal are not self-evident. Given that in
the third line skinning does not incur blame, there is no indication
that the earlier ominous prognoses were related to the animal
having been killed. It is plausible that the common activity of
skinning an animal could be auspicious or inauspicious depending
on which body area it is started at. This is suggested by the oracle
bone inscriptions in which the details of the color of the animal
and direction of the sacrificial act are crucial to its efficacy. Despite
there being no overt expression of concern about cruelty, it is
probably significant that so many of the omens mentioned in the
Zhouyi are violent or emotionally intense sightings.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     159



23.5 As early as Wang Bi’s commentary the fish were taken as
referring to the palace ladies. Supposedly the elegantly dressed
concubines resemble the flashing scales of fish. Rutt notes that
Gao Heng took the dried fish strung together as an analogy for
palace ladies lined up in a prescribed order (317). Because fish
symbolize abundance (裕 yu abundance, is a homonym for 鱼 yu,
fish), the analogy of their streaming in might refer to there being
many palace ladies, or a hint at fertility. The line can be taken as a
disparagement of women but need not be.

23.6 A common factor in all the line texts is reference to food: ewe,
fish, fruit. The last phrase may have been placed in this hexagram
because it shares the character for flaying/stripping with the first
four. Its first phrase is a metaphor, perhaps deliberately concealing
its meaning of talent being unused. The paradigmatic example is
Confucius, who was himself a disappointed office-seeker. However,
the next phrase seems discordant as the upright person is rewarded
with a cart, while the petty person is deprived of his house. In the
context of the aristocratic society of the time, it is tempting to see
these phrases as implied social criticism—the rich get more and the
poor lose what they have. While the I Ching lacks the explicit social
criticism of later texts such as the Lunyu, Laozi, and Zhuangzi, it is
plausible that some phrases were intended as disguised complaints.
Given the compiled nature of the text it is possible that what
was originally social criticism was not recognized as such when
incorporated into the Changes.

        24. Commentary 復 Fu Return
The tag occurs in all six line texts. According to the Grand Ricci
dictionary, in the Zhou this character could also mean calling the
soul of a dead person. I have not seen this in any translation but it
seems possible, given that necromancy was a method of divination.
However, “return” fits well with the line texts. Return, whether of
objects lent or lost, household members, or oneself, is frequently
the subject of line texts.

24.0 This text is a collection of predictions about returns.
The phrase, “Coming and going there will be no infirmity,” or
variants of it is still in use 3,000 years later on Chinese lucky
posters and coins. The modern posters are typically printed on red
paper with gold characters. One adorns my own front door.
   Dao 道, along with yin and yang is the most famous concept
in Chinese philosophy. In the Zhouyi however, it has its original
meaning of path, road, or way, here and in its other appearances
(9.1, 10.2, 17.4, and 24.0).
   The phrase “seven days” is often translated as week, but the
early Chinese “week” was ten days. The numbers associated with
going and returning in the Zhouyi are often three or seven, perhaps
meaning several. While the lunar month of twenty-eight days and
solar year of 365 ¼ days are natural quantities, the seven-day week
and thirty or thirty-one day month are not.
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    163



24.1 This can also be rendered, “Far away, does not return.” It has
been translated both ways so a diviner could have chosen either
meaning, ambiguity being the lifeblood of divination.

24.2 This phrase suggesting a rest before returning is interesting
because the Zhouyi does not have much to say about basic human
well-being. In the modern world we take for granted the need
for resting and refreshing ourselves, but given that slavery and
conscript labor were pervasive in the ancient world, most lives
would have had little leisure.

24.3 Rutt (318) quotes Gao Heng 高亨 as saying that the phrase
refers to “the frown of consternation that comes on the face of one
startled to find himself on such a brink [of water.]” Gao (Heng
1900–86), although one of the most famous and influential of
China’s twentieth century critical philologists, was given to this
sort of fanciful emendation of even the most straightforward
passages. His proposed reading of this line is inconsistent with the
nature of the Zhouyi, which provides only set phrases to describe
behavior related to emotion. This does not mean that people
were any less emotional than later in history, rather that written
language to describe such behaviors as facial expression and tone
of voice had not yet developed.

24.6 It is unclear which side wins the battle, reminiscent of the
famous tale of King Croesus, who was told by his diviner that if he
attacked, a great empire would be destroyed. He attacked, but it
was his own empire that was destroyed.

       25. Commentary 无妄 Wu Wang
               Unexpected
The title is translated by Wilhelm-Baynes as “Unexpected”
but tends to have implications of something unfavorable. The
Mawangdui manuscript has a different title, 无孟 Wumeng, trans-
lated by Shaughnessy as “Pestilence,”(50f., 291) following Waley
(131f.). Waley’s line of reasoning is based on the reference to a
cow or bull in 25.3, which he takes to be an animal to be sacrificed
to drive out disease. Waley assumed, as did Chinese literati, that
the lines within a chapter are thematically related, but clearly this
is not always the case. The more common reading, with seems
quite straightforward to me, is simply a tied-up cow, no doubt an
everyday sight.
   A theme of this chapter is the reign of the unexpected; that is,
the misfortunes that can occur despite careful planning. These
are negative prognostications because the misfortunes are not
preventable. An important term here is 眚 shen, which can imply
failure of vision. This reminds us that the purpose of divination
was to enable one to foresee what is not yet fully apparent, that is:
to recognize incipience.
   Despite modern dismissal of divination as irrational, it was
an essential method for preparing for future possibilities. Since,
despite the admonition in 4.0, multiple divinations were often
performed, they would indicate different possible outcomes of a
situation. We should not assume that divination always led to poor
decisions. A comparable situation today is financial forecasting. It
is clear that markets cannot be predicted, yet investment decisions
are usually based on the advice of experts.

25.0 This judgment consists of two set phrases and the more
interesting proverb to the effect that those not of low character
do not fully see the world as it is. This would seem to be a moral
statement, seeing the world as it is presumably implying recognizing
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    167



the proper way to behave. One senses here a foreshadowing of the
Confucian assumption that moral knowledge is factual.

25.2 The first two phrases are a proverb, meaning that if one
does not lay the groundwork, one will not attain one’s goals. The
agricultural reference expresses the fundamental rhythm of life
in the ancient world. If the first three phrases are combined, the
meaning seems to be that if one cannot farm, one had best travel,
perhaps to find a better living.

25.3 This seems to be about someone’s ox being stolen but the
word order leaves it unclear.
   Loss of a water buffalo is still an economic catastrophe in much
of rural Asia.

25.5 It is curious that the Zhouyi contains relatively few references
to disease, as divination was the main means of diagnosis in the
ancient world. This would make it seem likely that other methods
were used for this purpose. The Baoshan records many divinations
regarding disease and treatment. The cause of Shao Tuo’s disease—
in whose tomb the text was found—is not diagnosable in modern
terms by the limited description in the text, but was assumed to be
transgression against unknown spirits. Cook points out that travel
inevitably involved trespassing on regions ruled by irascible spirits
who might inflict disease in retaliation. The only means of learning
about spirits is, by necessity, some form of divination.
    In 25.6 as with 25.0 I have translated 眚 sheng as implying poor
vision; in the sense of not seeing a situation clearly, based on its
literal meaning as cataracts or other physical vision impairment.

26.6 Where the heavenly crossroads for making offering?
上九何天之衢亨.



          26. Commentary 大畜 Da Xu
                Large Livestock
Da Xu 大畜 literally means “large livestock” and is consistent
with several references to farm animals in the line texts. Wilhelm-
Baynes’ translation as “taming power of the great” is not based on
the Western Zhou texts, but on trigram positions. In this hexagram,
the mountain trigram, also termed “keeping still,” is above the
trigram for heaven. Thus it is interpreted as the mountain taming
heaven. This is not very clear as a cosmological conception—given
that heaven symbolized the cosmic order, why would it need to be
tamed?
   The texts of this hexagram are mostly references to common
sights in a farming society: calves, pigs, a broken cart. These could
simply be observations of daily life, but more likely are included
because they function as omens—seemingly unremarkable sights
holding hidden meanings. This was equally true in the classical
world of Greece and Rome. In the latter, augury, that is divination
by bird flock patterns, was essential for political decisions. Cicero
was an augur, despite his skepticism regarding divination as
concluded in his detailed analysis in De Divinatione.

26.0 Why it would be auspicious not to eat at home is not stated.
This could simply mean that it is favorable to eat away from home,
or that at this moment, eating at home would be unlucky. The only
way to make sense of this is to regard it as an instance of the early
Chinese belief that the place where actions are performed affects
one’s luck. It is an example of the belief that even the simplest
actions could have hidden consequences.

26.1 This is a straightforward divinatory admonition. Rutt notes
that many Chinese scholars followed Wen Yiduo 聞一多 (1899–
1946) in emending the last word so that the phrase means
“beneficial to sacrifice” (249, 319). There is, however, no support
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      171



for this speculation in the text. There are enough references to
sacrifice in the Zhouyi that we do not need another one.

26.2 A cart stopped because its axle brackets were broken would
have seemed inauspicious, but the meanings assigned to omens are
often idiosyncratic. An idea common to many cultures is that a
minor accident may be a good thing because it substitutes for one
that would have been much worse.

26.3 In this case, the fine steed is likely an omen, though also
an inspiring sight. A contemporary Chinese proverb tells us,
“When the horse arrives, success follows.” Thus I have placed 利
li beneficial, as part of this phrase rather than the following one.

26.4 A bull with undamaged horns would have been a desirable
sacrifice, so a board was placed across the horns to prevent them
from being broken. This is a suitable place to point out the immense
depletion of resources resulting from the practice of sacrifice.

26.5 A castrated boar would have had much smaller tusks than an
intact one. Perhaps such a tusk was a lucky amulet, as rabbit’s feet
once were in America. If not castrated, boars develop an unpleasant
odor known as “boar taint,” which renders their meat unpalatable.
Though modern urbanites are likely to regard castration without
analgesia as cruel, communities that depended on farming for their
survival have to be matter-of-fact about such practices.

26.6 This is a reference to a location in the night sky, the crossroads
of heaven being an asterism consisting of the four stars in Scorpio
that mark the intersection of celestial equator and ecliptic. It is
often translated as finding the way of heaven for oneself. Rutt, who
was an Episcopal missionary, translated it as, “Receiving heaven’s
grace” (249).

27.6 According to the jawbone, harsh.

上九由頤, 厲. 吉利涉大川.



       27. Commentary 頤 Yi Lower Jaw
The tag designates the mandible, that is the lower bone of the jaw
(Schuessler 1987: 732 n.16). The character for jawbone occurs in
all lines but 27.5. I have translated as jaw, rather than jawbone, as
the latter in English has the implication of haranguing not present
in the Chinese. This is one of the rare hexagram figures that, like
hexagram 50 Deng (cauldron), can be imagined to resemble what
it designates. The upper and lower lines suggest an open mouth
and the broken lines in between may be imagined to be teeth, as
Rutt suggests (320). Plausibly, the tag and texts for this hexagram
were together because of the resemblance of the hexagram to open
jaws. Unfortunately for those learning to write in Chinese, only a
tiny minority of the characters are at all pictographic. Some use
imagined pictorial resemblances to use as mnemonics but these
have nothing to do with the actual origin of the characters.
   So pervasive were omens in ancient China that one hesitates to
state that anything visible could not have been an omen. In context,
a kind of physiognomy based on facial movements rather than
dental condition seems more likely as bodily movements, voluntary
and involuntary, were a pervasive means of divination. This is part
of the pre-scientific enchantment of the world, in which virtually
everything has a supernatural meaning.
   Because the texts of this chapter, with their recurrent references
to jaws or jawbones, seem particularly obscure, even nonsensical,
they help us recognize how different from modern times was the
imaginaire of the Chinese Bronze Age. The obscurity of the texts
diminishes once they are recognized as a compilation of prognos-
tications based on jaw movements, presumably human. Rutt
translates the tag as “molars,” speculating that the opened jaws
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    175



revealed the condition of the teeth, which supposedly would have
had mantric significance (250). Jaw movements would seem more
likely as the basis of divination. It should be noted that divination
by the face is based on physical features, not the emotion expressed.
Though early Chinese writing contains relatively few descriptions
of emotion, this of course does not mean that emotions were not
felt.
   Lines 27.3 and 27.6 may refer to use of a jawbone as a
divinatory device. Use of bone objects as divinatory substrates
is further suggested by the reference to the divinatory (or spirit)
turtle. In many early texts reference is made to divination by
tortoise and milfoil, but the Zhouyi rarely mentions the former.
The tortoise mention is also puzzling as the method we know of,
the oracle bones, was extremely elaborate, requiring a heated poker
being pressed against the shell to cause cracks. Plastromancy was
mostly for royal divination and would be too difficult and expensive
for routine inquiries. How turtle shells or one may have been used
as divinatory objects without crack-making we do not know.
   In enchanted worlds, any object or event could be a communi-
cation from the spiritual world. While it might be hard to decipher
the message correctly, the meaning was there. New Age writings
often present the enchanted world as richer than our secular one,
but fail to recognize the extreme anxiety regarding the often malign
powers of supernatural beings in ancient times. Ordinary events
taken as omens would be frequent triggers of anxiety and the risk
of offending spirits was omnipresent. Life in an enchanted world
is now almost impossible to conceive. It has been relegated to the
realm of entertainment in which being scared can be fun. It was
not fun in the Western Zhou. Later in China collections of strange
or supernatural tales were published, perhaps the most famous
was the Qing dynasty collection of Yuan Mei (Santangelo). This
collection has a tongue-in-cheek quality reminiscent of the writings
of Charles Fort. However, in the Bronze Age such stories were
almost certainly taken as factual.

27.0 My translation makes the second phrase into a proverb
meaning not recognizing the obvious.

27.1 This line seems to advise not using one’s tortoise for
divination, but look at someone’s jawbone instead. Choice of
176	              THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



divinatory method would have been a decision of great moment,
though often multiple methods were used, a tacit admission of the
uncertain reliability of divination.

27.2 Jing 經 here is the same character translated as “classic” in the
titles of I Ching, Shijing, etc. The same phrase recurs in 27.5. In the
Zhouyi texts jing does not mean classic. Since it contains the silk
radical, it most likely refers here to preparing silk as a grave good.
The word jing can also mean suicide; hanging with a silk scarf was
a means for women to commit suicide, though not attested so early
as far as I am aware. It is conceivable that this is the implication
of jing here, given the reference to a grave. Finally, the word also
referred to menstruation in the phrase 月經 yue jing, now read
as “monthly classic,” but originally would have been “monthly
fabric,” the cloth used to absorb menstrual blood. References to
intimate aspects of femininity are, however, almost totally lacking
in Chinese texts.

27.3 While the underlying theme of the Book of Changes is
that situations change rapidly, in this case the prognostication is
particularly unfavorable as the situation will last for ten years.
Such long time frames are unusual in the Zhouyi.

27.4 The tiger-like staring is a phrase still in use today, indicating
extreme lust or greed. It is not clear whether this line is a warning
about being stared at in this fashion, or that seeing someone
gaze like a tiger is a favorable omen. Such appearances of oral
set phrases in the Zhouyi that are still in use 3,000 years later
testifies to the extreme longevity of some oral material. It also
suggests the possibility that some of the phrases may have been
in use for centuries before being recorded in the written classic.
Accordingly a single date for the composition of the Changes is
misleading because it clearly contains much older material. While
it is tempting to try to reconstruct dates for different portions of the
text, they are at best guesswork and best avoided.

27.5 “Brushing fabric” here may refer to women’s domestic
activities, hence a good omen for a home.
   The final phrase is anti-parallel to the final phrase of 27.6, a
common structure in the Zhouyi that can be traced back to the
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                  177



Shang oracle bone inscriptions, in which queries were often in
the form of paired opposites such as, “tomorrow it will rain,”
“tomorrow it will not rain.”

27.6 Here the jawbone seems to be that of an animal, somehow used
for divination. Archaeology has discovered large bone workshops
in the Yin ruins near Anyang. Their physical strength and ubiquity
made them useful for practical, decorative, and ritual purposes.

         28. Commentary 大過 Da Guo
                Big Mistake
This tag contrasts with the tag of number 62, “Small Mistake.”
Both tags are simple divinatory responses but have no content
specifying the nature of the mistakes. They bear no evident
relationship to the line texts of their hexagrams. Wilhelm’s trans-
lation of the tag is based on the hexagram figure in which the center
consists of four firm or yang lines, interpreted as meaning strength.

28.0 The ridgepole is the beam under the peak of the roof that
supports the entire structure, similar to the keystone of an arch. As
a critical part of a building it would have had magical significance.
The various ways the ridgepole is bent seem to be significant as
omens, not as indications of loss of structural integrity. Making an
offering might be part of preparations for a journey.

28.1 Mao 茅 literally is cogon grass but I have translated simply as
“white grass.” This plant was used to wrap sacrificial offerings. It
is also referred to in 11.1 and 12.1. It grows prolifically and is now
considered a weed. It probably would have been also useful as floor
covering because of its easy availability and thickness. Rushes were
used for floor covering in the medieval West as well. The reference
here is about ritual use.

28.2 The first phrase seems to be a proverb, expressing the renewal
of nature.
   The second phrase has a symbolic meaning of renewal. Though
usually translated as “an old man gets a young wife,” the man
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    181



getting his daughter married fits the theme of renewal better. It
also draws attention to the traditional Chinese attitude that an
unmarried daughter is a burden. In fact, feeding and clothing
children were significant expenses for the common people and so
marrying off a daughter would have been a relief for poor families.
Cultural factors that restricted much economically productive
labor to men were obviously a factor here. However, we should not
imagine that there were never affectional ties between daughters
and other family members. The Zhouyi contains little mention
of emotions but this does not mean they were not felt. As in the
Lunyu of Confucius, Chinese writings tended to speak of obliga-
tions rather than affection.

28.3/28.4 These explain how bends in ridgepoles were to be
interpreted as omens. In 28.4 we have what is now called a
mixed message. Diviners can easily fill in the blanks as to what is
auspicious and what will be regretted.

28.5 Shi 士 is an important term for social status but can have
multiple meanings. Later it came to mean the class of men who
were educated, but not of noble rank, who sought government
office. Confucius was of the shi class. It also, however, can mean a
military officer, or simply a bachelor. In analogy to contemporary
society, it referred to the middle class—people whose livelihood
is based on education and ability, rather than family status. For
detailed discussion of the social structure of early China see Hsu
(1965).
   The old tree producing flowers suggests that this marriage
would be fertile. Depending on the age at which a woman would
be considered 老婦 lao fu that is, old, this is plausible. In an era
of child marriages, when life expectancy for women was the
mid-twenties, women might be considered old before they were
thirty.

28.6 “Ominous but without blame,” need not be contradictory—
something bad has happened, but the inquirer will not be blamed.
Line six was usually read as referring to self-sacrifice, which
was not blameworthy according to Chinese ethics. Indeed, the
official sacrificing his life for the sake of principle was a common
Confucian theme. In many stories, courtiers were executed for
182	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



properly admonishing the ruler. Despite these exemplary tales,
other documentary sources indicate that as in all governments,
sycophants outnumber martyrs. This line might also refer to the
practice of widows drowning themselves by wading into a river
with stones tied to them. To the extent this actually happened, it
may often have been to escape the deceased husbands’ oppressive
family. On the other hand, in later writings there were many
salacious anecdotes about widows’ licentious behavior, so such
self-immolation could not have been common. For later stories of
extreme self-denial for the sake of obligations, see Knapp.

          29. Commentary 習坎 Xi Kan
               Numerous Pitfalls
The first character of the title means repeated or numerous. The
second character of the title 坎 kan has nearly always been translated
as “pit.” Among the uses of pits were disposition of rubbish, holding
prisoners, and burial. Even in the Western Zhou it must have been
a metaphor to refer to repeated obstacles or dangers, as it does in
current English. Wilhelm-Baynes’ translation as “abysmal” also
makes the pits metaphorical but is misleading because in current
English, “abysmal” usually means “terrible,” rather than “deep.”
   Except for the recurring imagery of deep pits as hazards,
this is not a particularly coherent hexagram. Most likely it was
composed by combining separate fragments referring to pits. Pits
are dangerous only if unnoticed so the divinatory meaning would
be an unanticipated hazard.
   Possibly pits were involved in sacrifice since that is the other
main theme of the chapter—the wine vessel was likely used to
make offerings.

29.0 The gruesome details of human sacrifice are suppressed not
only in most classical texts but in modern scholarly ones as well.
Bodily disruption was inflicted both in sacrifices and executions.
The character for heart, xin 心 is plausibly said to be a pictograph
of the heart and great vessels so whoever invented it obviously had
knowledge of the appearance of this organ. The motif of going to
one’s death with dignity is common in Confucian hagiography. In
the Zhouyi, except in this line, the victims are described as fearful
rather than brave.
	               TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     185



29.4 This line text seems somewhat garbled but refers to gathering
food and drink.

29.5 Both Kunst and Rutt translate 祗既平 as the earth god being
satisfied, apparently based on Waley. Though this is a plausible
guess, the Zhouyi in its frequent advice to make offerings does not
generally specify the entity to whom the offering is intended. There
is no overt reference to an earth god in the Zhouyi.

29.6 Putting prisoners in a bramble bush is yet a further indication
of the cruelty of the era. The final phrase about not being found
does not seem to refer to the prisoners, unless it refers to their
escaping.
   Who or what cannot be found is unspecified. The much later
Fuyang version begins with a phrase that is a fragment of what I
have translated as, “For three years it is not possible. Ominous.”
The rest is entirely different, reading, as translated by Shaughnessy:

    Divining about clearing: it will not clear; divining about hunting;
    you will not obtain anything; beneficial to the middle …
    (2014: 251)

These variants are consistent with the current view that there was
not one Changes, but a variety of Changes-type manuscripts. Some
are fragmentary due to poor preservation but others add details not
in the received version. The latter tendency is apparent in the still
later Guoshan manuscript (Cook 2006).

         30. Commentary 離 Li Oreole
I have followed Rutt and used “oreole,” which makes some sense
for lines 30.2 and 30.3, while alternatives such as “attach” do
not make sense for any of the line texts. The original suggestion
was that of Gao Heng, who based it on oreole references in some
of the lyrics in the Book of Songs, translated as “yellow oreole”
(322f.). Lines 30.2 and 30.3 are clearly bird omens, which are quite
frequent in the Zhouyi.
    Wilhelm-Baynes’ translate the tag as “fire,” based on the
hexagram, which is the doubled trigram Li, fire in the correlative
system. However, there is no evidence that the names for the
trigrams existed in the Western Zhou, nor is there any reference to
fire in the line texts. Although in the modern world fire tends to
be thought of as destructive, according to the Book of Documents
(Shangshu) fire was one of the six treasures of life, the others being:
water, metals, wood, earth, and grains. This reminds us that for
most of human history, fire was the only means of heat, cooking,
and illumination, as well as firing ceramics and casting bronzes.
    Mawangdui has Luo, a character not available in standard
fonts, translated by Shaughnessy as “net” (134f., 312). He trans-
lates the received tag as “Fastening” (2014: 252).
    The texts associated with this hexagram are heterogeneous.
Only by creative exegesis can the lines be made to have any
thematic relationship. The imagery is quite concrete.

30.0 The specification of a female bovine suggests that breeding
here refers to putting the cow with a bull for impregnation. Thus it
is practical advice for agricultural management. Wilhelm-Baynes’
interpretation is that the cow represents docility and acceptance
of one’s lot. In the Zhouyi, however, animals are almost always
omens, not symbols of personality traits. The tiger and leopard of
49.5 and 49.6 being exceptions.

30.1 履 lu treading is also the name of hexagram 10. This line
provides advice on comportment. Ritually correct body position
and movements in the presence of someone more powerful
were extremely important, as perceived disrespect could prompt
summary execution.

30.2 This is clearly an omen. Rutt, whose translation I have
borrowed, shows convincingly that this refers to a specific species
of oriole frequently mentioned in the Shijing, the Book of Songs.
   In later China, yellow was the color associated with death.
One term for the realm beyond death was the “yellow springs.”
However, yellow had many other associations, including use for
imperial robes.

30.3 The image of the setting sun is an obvious allusion to death.
In a famous episode, Zhuangzi is found beating on a pot after the
death of his wife. An acquaintance remonstrates with him about
this seeming disrespect, but Zhuangzi explains that everyone comes
from earth and returns to it. Beating on a pot seems to have been
an early way of expressing grief, which Zhuangzi contrasted with
the elaborate rituals of his own time.
   Shaughnessy notes that 耋 die, old age in the received text, is in
the Mawangdui version written as 絰, also pronounced die, a scarf
worn for mourning(134f., 313 n.7). This is a case in which the
different characters are phonetically identical, yet both make equal
sense. The prognosis of “ominous” is consistent because the earlier
phrases are about death.

30.4 Wilhelm-Baynes’ wording is elegant and plausible:

    Its coming is sudden;
    It flames up, dies down, is thrown away. (121)

Wang Bi interpreted this phrase as referring to light and dark, that
is yin and yang, giving way to each other. However, like most of
the cosmological interpretations, it is more a riff on the early text
than actually contained in it. The allure of the yin-yang cosmology
is that it can be applied to almost anything—gender, the cycle of
day and night, dry and moist—and to any of the ups and downs of
human life. The yin-yang concept has spread everywhere and does
190	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



seem to help people make sense of events. It was not present in the
Zhouyi but the diagrams made up of two kinds of lines seemed
ready-made for representation of this duality.

30.5 This sort of line text almost makes the translator weep a flood
of tears trying to figure out how despair can have an auspicious
prognostication attached to it. It often seems that the prognoses
are added at random. However, like so many of the puzzling
phrases in the Zhouyi, this can make sense if seeing the crying
person is an omen, though with an unusually paradoxical meaning.
Conceivably, it may be an instance of one’s potential misfortune
being inflicted on someone else.

30.6 “Headsman” is the English term for those who carried out
executions by beheading. Macabre as it sounds, the skill of these
individuals was judged by the crowd attending public executions,
a single stroke being considered merciful. In England, being
beheaded rather than hanged was the “privilege” of nobility; often
the offense was political. Beheading was the standard means of
sacrificing captives in ancient China as attested by the thousands
of skeletons of headless victims in the Anyang area and elsewhere.

上六咸其輔, 頰, 舌.



       31. Commentary 咸 Xian Sensation
The division of the Zhouyi into two parts is an old one, though the
reason for placing the division between hexagrams 30 and 31 is
unclear. It has no thematic significance.
   Although the tag 咸 Xian, has multiple possible translations,
sensation fits well in all its occurrences. Shaughnessy points to
convincing philological evidence for the tag character meaning
feelings or sensations (1997: 309 n.1). The line texts of this
hexagram are clearly about bodily sensations as omens, giving this
hexagram a high degree of consistency. A few expressions that
were originally based on bodily sensations being omens are still in
use in the modern West: gut instinct, feeling in my bones, or the
old notion that elderly people with arthritis can tell it will rain by
how their joints feel.
   Kunst and Rutt take the tag character as about mutilation, Kunst as
“cut off” (300f.) and Rutt as “chopping” (324, 254); possibly butch-
ering of an animal or the mutilation of a human sacrifice victim,
a practice for which there is abundant archaeological evidence.
Sensation is clearly a better fit both graphically and phonetically.
While Rutt regarded Waley as, “perhaps over-enthusiastic about
finding proverbs in Zhouyi,” the counter-charge would be that Rutt
was over-enthusiastic about finding sacrifice and mutilation. Not
every reference to the body is about violence.

31.0 The woman to be chosen might be a wife, a concubine
(secondary wife with legal status), or a servant. Qu 取, which I
have translated as choosing, could also mean capturing or taking.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      193



This uncertainty results in this phrase not being useful in assessing
the degree of female autonomy in Western Zhou China. I selected
choosing qu as open in meaning—the man making a choice does not
necessarily mean that the woman cannot refuse. Significantly, the
Zhouyi does not contain a parallel passage to the effect of, “favorable
to take a husband.” Even under the best of circumstances, a young
woman’s life choices were mostly made by her family. Powerful men,
however, could force women, even if already married to someone
else, to become their wives or concubines. Unlucky women served
as spoils of war. The situation was similar throughout the ancient
world and, regrettably, still exists in many non-Western societies.
   As all but 31.4 refer to sensations in parts of the body in
ascending order, this is one of the most systematic hexagrams,
seemingly a guide to interpreting the location of bodily sensations
as omens. The assignment of prognostics to body parts would have
served as a mnemonic, something like ars memorativa, but simpler
and requiring no literacy (Yates 1996; Spence 1985).

31.1 While the judgment text refers to a woman, the line texts have
no gender specific reference; presumably bodily sensations would
serve as omens for both men and women. Plausibly women had
systems of their own, but there is no written record of these.

31.3. This might mean holding onto the thigh where the sensation
is being felt, or that following or pursuing will bring regret, perhaps
because of pain in the leg. For the next phrase my translation is an
approximation.

31.4 The final word, 思 si, seems to refer to thoughts or
longing. This is problematic as there are few references to mental
states in the Zhouyi, although references to emotion are much
more common in the approximately contemporaneous Shijing.
Given the frequency of longing as a theme in poetry, especially that
of China, it is tempting to regard the final phrases as borrowed
from a song.

31.5 A simple omen.

31.6 This completes the bottom to top ordering of the omens.

32.6 Trembling that endures is ominous.
上六振恆凶.



       32. Commentary 恆 Heng Enduring
Heng 恆 here refers to persisting over a long period of time, not
to a character trait. De or virtue 德 appears in 32.3, but most
likely refers to the kind of obligations that were fundamental
to social cohesion in feudal-like societies. Having obligations
implies a sense of responsibility, but here again we find state-
ments about behavior rather than abstract virtues. This separates
the Western Zhou meanings from the later Confucian readings.
Still, in notions of obligation we find a seed of later philosophical
theorizing.

32.0 The judgment text consists simply of routine prognostications,
without any clue as to what circumstances they apply to. Of course
in an actual divination the inquiry would make this clear.

32.1 This is quite vague but refers to a bad situation getting worse.
This is a routine divinatory response as everyone has situations in
their life that get worse.

32.3 De 德, familiar as the second word of the title of the Dao De
Jing, is notoriously difficult to translate. At first it meant virtue
in the sense of innate power or efficacy, later it also meant virtue
as a moral quality. As noted above, it seems to have had the
early meaning of obligations incurred by receiving favor. Mutual
obligation is important in all societies but in early societies was
so on a personal basis. For example, the king would grant land
and in return be owed military service. This pattern is essential for
the functioning of all societies—the government provides police
protection, builds infrastructure and provides many other services;
in return we owe taxes and sometimes military services.
    The cause of the shame is unstated, but frequent shaming is
unavoidable in a society with detailed and arbitrary rules for
personal conduct. While the vocabulary of emotion in the Zhouyi
is quite limited, shame is the affective state most frequently referred
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    197



to. A once common Western critique of Chinese ethics was that
morality was based on shame rather than guilt, that is, on fear of
social disapproval rather than an inner sense of right and wrong.
While it is true that the Zhouyi frequently mentions blame and
shame but has nothing to say about self-criticism, this cannot
be taken as evidence that what we call guilt did not exist. An
open-minded reading of the Lunyu will quickly dispel this miscon-
ception. Moral self-examination has been a major theme in Chinese
philosophy from Confucius and Laozi onward. Oddly, this can
also be translated as: receiving delicacies.

32.4 This could imply without birds and beasts, but in early
civilization the main interest in wild creatures was for hunting.

32.5 An odd domestic situation here implying a story. Unfortunately,
as usual in this work, we are deprived of details.

32.6 Persistent trembling might be a medical observation based on
experience, as even shamanistic healers must have learned from. It
could be a sign of Parkinson’s disease, for example. It might also
be another bodily omen; indeed, there would have been no concept
differentiating omens from symptoms.

33.6 A fat piglet. Nothing not beneficial.
上九肥遯. 无不利。



        33. Commentary 遯 Dun Piglet
Dun 遯 literally means flee or escape but the emendation of Gao
Heng, to tun piglet has been widely accepted (Field 2015: 156f.).
The tag character differs in the main excavated manuscripts.
In the Shanghai Museum bamboo slips, it is an obsolete graph
also pronounced dun and also containing the pig radical 豕 shi
as a component. Fuyang has 椽 chuan, meaning rafter or beam.
Mawangdui has 恆 heng, constancy, or long lasting. All of these
variants save the last share the pig component. This suggests either
that the early meaning was “pig,” or was misread as pig. In general,
the less abstract meaning is likely to be the earliest but withdrawal
is a very basic concept, especially given the frequency of combat in
the Western Zhou. These variants suggest that the Changes circu-
lated in slightly different versions, though the similarities between
versions are far more numerous than the differences.
   Piglet fits all the line texts, where they are clearly omens. The
piglets are to be butchered, but the divinatory significance is
not their possible use for sacrifice, but simply to seeing them. If
anything, seeing a piglet would have given rise to thoughts of how
tasty it would be when cooked, not to concern for the animal. The
modern dissociation between a live animal and meat does not exist
in agricultural societies.

33.0 An alternative way to translate the judgment is, “Make
offering, small benefit to divine.” There is no basis for concluding
which is correct—it could have been read either way in the Western
Zhou. This is another case in which the diviner would have
discretion in interpreting the line.

33.1 The reference to the tail rather than the entire pig is puzzling.
The meaning of “harsh,” is a typical omen in the sense that there
is no intuitive connection between the omen and its meaning. Of
course, there might have been such an association 3,000 years ago
but then we might expect a few hints as to the connection.
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    201



33.3 This suggests that seeing a piglet bound up augurs a difficult
illness, but for whom is not stated. We assume that divinatory
responses refer to the person making the inquiry but this is not
necessarily the case. One might ask about oneself but receive a
reply about a family member, or even one’s village or country.
The conjunction of phrases forecasting both a harsh illness and
favorable breeding of farm animals and servants seems peculiar to
say the least. However, such combinations are so common in the
Zhouyi that we should not be surprised by every such instance.
The compilers evidently did not find anything odd about this, and
the same may have been true in actual divinations—both good
and bad news might be given in the same reading. There is also a
frequent pattern in Zhouyi texts of giving disparate implications
of the divination for different categories, as with husband and wife
in 32.5. The seeming equation of breeding animals and human
servants similarly should not be taken to conclude that servants
were regarded simply as breeding stock. Early agricultural societies
may not always have used special, politer, language for human as
opposed to animal reproduction.
    The Zhouyi does not tell us whether omens tended to have fixed
meanings—a bound piglet portending success in animal breeding,
for example, or whether they were spur of the moment on the part
of the diviner.

33.6 Fat animals are a sign of abundance and so are positive omens
in many cultures.

上六羝羊觸藩. 不能退. 不能遂.



       34. Commentary 大壯 Da Zhuang
              Great Strength
Da Zhuang 大壯 means great strength or force. This hexagram
has more unity than most with 34.3, 34.4, 34.5, and 34.6 having
a degree of narrative structure. The ram who has gotten his horns
stuck in a fence is presented as an analogy for cleverness being
better than brute strength. The ram is at first stuck, then breaks the
fence and gets free, but only after being unable to move forward
or back for a period of time. The upright person who succeeds by
cunning is the model to be followed, not the ram.
   In a clear example of a scribal substitution which is both
phonetic and semantic, Mawangdui has 泰 tai instead of 大 da.
Shaughnessy translates it as “great” in this context (1996: 88f.) Tai
is also the tag for hexagram 11 in the received version, but not in
the equivalent Mawangdui hexagram, which is 34.
   Kunst and Rutt, following Gao Heng, translate zhuang as injury
rather than strength (Rutt: 326f.) Like many of the great Chinese
philologist’s proposed emendations, this one seems gratuitous.
Claims of homophone substitutions cannot by their nature be
proven wrong, but my principle has been to avoid emending when
the received meaning makes sense, as it does here. This is not to
disparage the more far-fetched suggestions of learned philologists
such as Waley and Gao Heng. Not infrequently they are right and
their proposals are always stimulating. Textual criticism must
always be mindful of the risk of lapsing into rigidity. With texts
of the antiquity and terseness of the Zhouyi no suggestion can be
dismissed out of hand.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                       205



34.0 A routine invocation. Why some judgment texts simply repeat
stock phrases, and others have substantive content more like line
statements, is unclear. It could be that different compilers had
different stylistic preferences. Some may have deliberately grouped
phrases that shared key characters. Others may have seen their task
as simply getting all the material put together—organizing the text
bits to fit the six line templates may have been the sole principle
guiding the work.
   As a thought experiment, consider having a container filled with
hundreds of bits of bamboo, each with a phrase brushed on, often
in variant characters, and having to organize them into a book. Or
think of what it would be like to take the Changes as we have it now
and try to reorganize the phrases into thematic order. Frustrated as
we are trying to figure out what the compilers have left us, we
should remain thankful for their work, done when writing was still
new. Just restoring the damaged strips of the Shanghai Museum
Zhouyi and trying to determine their original order took China’s
greatest experts several years, though the parlous condition of the
manuscript was a major factor.

34.1 Strong feet are obviously important for marching. If my
punctuation is correct, this is the only instance in the Zhouyi in
which it is dangerous to hold captives; usually doing so is highly
auspicious, (though only for the captors). Alternatively, it could
be that the military expedition carried out to take captives is
hazardous.

34.3 As I have translated, the phrase states that the refined
(or unscrupulous) accomplish their goals not with force, but
with cunning. This is clearly a proverb and applies to politics
everywhere. Confucian texts tend to recommend virtue rather
than cunning, but here the Zhouyi is realistic about official life.
The shi class of educated professionals did not exist as such in
the Western Zhou. Most high officials were relatives of the king.
Blood ties did not obviate cunning or treachery. The idea of
meritocracy, so prominent in Chinese political theory, did not yet
exist.
   The last phrase of this line is a proverb about pointless effort. It
reprises the idea that brute strength is not as effective as cleverness.
A ram getting his horns caught in a fence is a proverb still in use
206	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



today, another interesting example of the extreme persistence of
oral material.

34.4 Eventually the ram does break the fence and free his horns,
showing his great strength. The last phrase is uncertain. Some have
translated it as the ram attacking the cart. Since this makes no sense
I have rendered it as a comparison of a cart’s sturdiness to a ram’s
physique.

34.5 Yi here is generally taken to be a place name, not “easy”
nor “change,” as it means in the title of the classic. Alternatively,
it could mean, “To lose a sheep on the way is easy.” If so, the
shepherd escapes blame.

34.6 “The ram’s horns are entangled,” is a proverb referring to the
common situation in which one is stuck with no evident way out.
However, the final phrase indicates that after this difficulty, things
will become favorable, perhaps referring back to 34.4.

       35. Commentary 晉 Jin Advance
Jin 晉 means advance and is included in lines 35.1, 35.2, 35.4,
and 35.6. Wilhelm-Baynes translate it as “progress,” but this is
misleading with its implication of the modern concept of progress
as social and technological improvement. This, the Whig theory of
history, is contrary to the views of the early Chinese philosophers
including Confucius and Laozi, who considered that their time
had declined from the ideal society of high antiquity. Medieval
Christianity held a similarly negative idea of history as movement
away from the truth of revelation.
   This hexagram shares some verbal elements with the preceding
one, suggesting either that compilers often grouped textual elements
simply because they shared words or phrases. Alternatively, adjacent
hexagrams could have been compiled by the same individuals, thus
displaying their stylistic preferences.

35.0 Because of the ambiguity of early Chinese, this could also
mean that the horses were conferred by Marquis Kang on someone
else. Gifts have always been very important in China—and other
cultures as well—to establish the mutual obligations that hold
societies together. Given that money was not widely used, grants
of valuables: livestock, land, ritual bronzes, ornamental clothing,
were the main forms of exchangeable wealth.

35.2 The “good fortune from the king’s mother” is most likely a
reference to a specific historical event in which she bestowed benefits
upon an individual whose identity cannot now be determined.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     209



35.3 That there should be concern for the welfare of the common
people is expressed in Confucian and Daoist philosophy but is
largely unmentioned in the Zhouyi, this line being an exception. It
does suggest however that government may not have been entirely
indifferent to their plight. That later mythology of the Western
Zhou made it a paragon of good government tells us little about
actual conditions.

35.4 Rutt points out that 鼫鼠 shi shu has been variously translated
as “flying squirrel,” “mole cricket,” or “vole mouse.” Ancient
proper nouns such as names of species of plants and animals,
town names, and the like are notoriously hard to translate with
certainty. Mole crickets are omens of good luck or rain in some
African and South American cultures. Whatever species is being
referred to here, it is clearly an omen. That it is harsh presumably
is because advance would be dangerous in the situation divined
about. Squirrels are timid so perhaps this means to advance in an
anxious situation. However, human traits that have been applied
to animals vary between cultures. This line contrasts with 35.5 in
which advancing is auspicious. As pointed out elsewhere, this is not
a contradiction because the diviner would have obtained one or the
other of these prognoses.

35.5 The second phrase expresses the wisdom, similar to that of
the much later Dao De Jing, of being detached from gain and loss.
However, it may simply be a prognostication to the effect that one
need not worry about loss or gain because advancing is favorable.

35.6 “Advance!” is a military command to move forward to
engage the enemy.
   The remaining phrases are somewhat contradictory, seeming
to advocate harshness against the enemy but warning that it will
later be regretted. This is certainly a plausible scenario—one attains
victory by ruthlessness, then regrets the misery resulting. Such
sensitivity is largely lacking in the Zhouyi so it is, unfortunately,
more plausible that the victors regret the destruction because their
spoils are less. Such speculation, however, goes beyond the text.

36.6 Not bright, but dim.

上六不明晦. 初登于天, 後入于地.



         36. Commentary 明夷 Ming Yi
               Calling Pheasant
The Wilhelm-Baynes translation as “Darkening of the Light,”
is poetic, but clearly incorrect. It is derived from the structure
of the hexagram, in which the earth trigram is above that for
heaven, hence earth is obscuring the light of heaven (Rutt: 378).
This cannot have been the early meaning because, as emphasized
previously, there is no evidence for trigram correlations before the
Zuozhuan and Ten Wings.
   The modern consensus following the work of Li Jingchi and
Gao Heng, is that ming in this hexagram does not have its usual
meaning of bright but refers to a pheasant. Kunst (310f.), Rutt
(259, 328–30), and Shaughnessy (2014: 258) all accept this and I
have followed it also as it fits well with the Zhouyi’s predilection
for bird call omens. The Shijing also refers frequently to birds, but
seemingly as symbols rather than as omens.
   The tag is repeated in all of the lines except the judgment. There
is nothing surprising about this as scholarly consensus is that the
judgments were composed separately from the line texts. There is
similar repetition in the Mawangdui and Fuyang manuscripts, both
excavated from tombs of the Western Han, indicating that these are
intrinsic parts of the text.
   Whincup translates the tag as, “Bright Pheasant,” and explicates
this image:

   The bright pheasant represents a brilliant minister, who remon-
   strates with his unworthy ruler … (125)

The pheasant as a symbol of the virtuous official is the invention of
later exegetes; it is questionable if it had this meaning in the Western
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     213



Zhou. The worthy official remonstrating with his unworthy ruler
is a central motif in Confucian writings. The Confucian officials
believed they were best qualified to conduct government affairs.
However as, members of the shi, or educated professional class,
they had no actual power, except that of moral suasion. Hence
the recurrent image of the virtuous official attempting to improve
the morals of his ruler. As always, those in power often failed to
appreciate being admonished. This idea of telling the ruler how
to improve himself was often read into the Confucian classics but
there is no evidence for this idea until the Spring and Autumn Era,
when Confucius lived. The Shijing and Chunqiu began to be read
as works of moral instruction, but there is little basis for this in
their literal meanings.

36.0 The divination is favorable for those encountering difficulties.
This is a typical sort of phrase used in “cold reading,” a euphemism
for fake psychic readings. Such phrases are usually on target since
everyone alive has difficulties of one sort or another. (My experience
suggests that many, but by no means all, who do readings with
I Ching, Tarot, or astrology are sincere. I discuss the nature of
divination in detail elsewhere. Redmond and Hon 2014: 19–36).

36.1 The meanings here are quite clear. The swooping pheasant is
a good omen and the upright person obeys his master’s summons.
So eager is he to obey that he does not take time to eat during the
three days it takes him to arrive. This theme is best known in the
myth of Yu the Great who worked tirelessly on flood control; for
thirteen years he never visited his family, even when passing by
his home. From such stories we learn that work-life balance was
problematic even in the Bronze Age. Examples of extreme virtue
at the expense of oneself or family are common in early literature,
such as Confucian tales of filial piety (Knapp 2005) and the Indian
Buddhist Jataka tales.

36.2 Rutt and Shaughnessy (2014: 258) translate this phrase as the
pheasant “wounded in the left thigh.” It may be that wounds were
interpreted as omens based on their location.
   The final phrase could be about being rescued by a horse rather
than gelding it. That the first reference to the calling pheasant is
favorable and the subsequent ones are not does not argue against
214	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



this as the line texts may well have been composed as a collection
of pheasant omens, not a narrative sequence. The identical phrase
also occurs in 59.1.

36.3 As previously mentioned, in hierarchical societies to be
leaderless, that is without a powerful backer, is a situation of
extreme vulnerability. Hence gaining a leader would make oneself
and one’s family more secure. This phrase has also been translated
as gaining, in the sense of capturing, someone of high rank.
   The final phrase likely represents a diviner’s declining to advise
about illness. Diviners not infrequently state that they cannot get
information about a specific question. A modern example is the
words spoken by Madame Sosostris’ famous clairvoyant line from
T. S. Eliot’s The Wasteland in which she claims to be forbidden to
see what is on one of her wicked pack of cards. To not to be able
to see everything likely increases the credibility of the diviner or
allows sensitive questions to be avoided.

36.4 Here the pheasant is a game animal. Wilhelm-Baynes’
translation shows the inherent difficulty of his literary style of
translation:

   He penetrates the left side of the belly.
   One gets at the very heart of the darkening of the light … (141)

The second phrase at first glance seems to mean something but on
closer reading says nothing intelligible. In the era of the Western
cliché of the inscrutable Orient, this might have passed, but now
it unnecessarily exacerbates the I Ching’s reputation for obscurity.
There is nothing mysterious or profound about shooting a pheasant
with bow and arrow.

36.5 In contrast to the previous line, here the pheasant is an
augury. Note that being an auspicious augury does not protect an
animal against being eaten.
   Rutt notes that Jizi was a righteous minister of the last [evil]
Shang king. Jizi frequently remonstrated against the evil ruler,
yet somehow survived and went into voluntary exile after the
Zhou conquest (Rutt: 330). There are surprisingly few such uses
of proper names in the Zhouyi, though some may not have been
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     215



recognized. This is odd since many of the phrases must have been
extracted from actual divinations.

36.6 Ming in context here must mean “bright,” even though the
line as a whole is about the flight of the pheasant. It is tempting to
interpret this as an augury meaning being successful at first, then
failing.

37.6 Holding captives who tremble as if in awe. Ends auspiciously.
上九有孚威如. 終吉.



         37. Commentary 家人 Jia Ren
               Family Members
Jiaren 家人 refers to the members of the family or household,
sometimes including servants. All lines except 37.6 are concerned
with domestic matters, mostly of ordinary families but also of the
king.

37.0 One of the Zhouyi’s infrequent references to women (nü 女
appears only nine times), this suggests that women, too, perform
divination with the Changes. However, it could equally mean,
“Divination favorable for a woman.” Read either way, it indicates
that divination was not exclusively for men. Chinese decorum
tended to keep women from the public eye—though probably less so
in early China. This decorum extended even to many canonical texts.
For example, Confucius mentions women only once in the Lunyu. In
the Zhouyi, most mentions of women are about marriages. The 左
傳, Zuozhuan, nominally a commentary on the Chunqiu (Spring and
Autumn Annals), as well as much later vernacular literature, contain
abundant references to women, not infrequently erotic, and often
derogatory. Women are particularly blamed for stirring up discord,
as with the wife of the evil last Shang king. Lady Macbeth is, after
all, an archetypal, if not historically accurate, figure.

37.2 The second phrase of this line refers to women’s domestic
work. While the Western Zhou was hardly a time of opportunity
for most women, we must remember that in an era with none of
the conveniences we take for granted, division of labor within
families was essential for survival and such tasks as preparing food,
making clothing and caring for children would have absorbed most
of the waking hours for wives and concubines, even in affluent
households with servants.

37.3 This line is particularly interesting because it seems to
condemn excessive strictness in the household—unexpected in
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                       219



an authoritarian society. Given that the most senior man had
almost unlimited power over the others in the household, in
many families the women and children must have been in a nearly
constant state of fear. There is not much gentleness in the Zhouyi,
so it is reassuring that Western Zhou life was not always one of
unrelenting harshness. Nonetheless, there is no indication that the
leniency mentioned here extends to the captives in 37.6.
   The second phrase, in context with the first, might be saying
that women and children should not be too silly acting. However,
in the Zhouyi, giggling or laughing seem usually to be indica-
tions of anxiety. So this might be nervous giggling, with the male
authority figure regretting that he has terrified the women and
children.

37.4 That being wealthy is auspicious seems self-evident, but
wealthy families could be destroyed, especially by malicious
allegations of witchcraft or fomenting rebellion (Liang Cai).

37.5 The king heading home would suggest a state of relative
security in the country. Wu xu 勿恤 also occurs in 35.5.

37.6 The likely significance of the first phrase is that they are
trembling in awe at the might of the Zhou. Obviously the
auspicious ending is not for the terrified captives. Once again we
find no expression of compassion for the human sacrificial victims.
   Yin Xu (Anyang), where the Shang-inscribed oracle bones were
found, contains remains of thousands of sacrificial victims—identi-
fiable as such because the skulls are separated from the bodies.
Unfortunately, the notion that innocents need to be killed for the
benefit of society is still present in the modern world. Examples
are Stalin’s death camps, the 35 million deaths in the Chinese
“Great Leap Forward,” and the Khmer Rouge extermination of
the literate. Pol Pot, the perpetrator of this latter atrocity, has been
quoted as saying after his show trial and house arrest, “If it were
not for me, there would be no Cambodia.”

Minford translates 37.6 last line as:

    Captives are terrified.
    Auspicious conclusion.
220	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



He interprets this as,

   Captives are being taken on as household slaves (and therefore
   part of the family. At first terrified and defiant, but ultimately
   they submit and all is well. (2014: 662)

This puts a much better face on this and similar passages than do
Kunst, Rutt, Field and myself. Given that mass sacrifice is verified
by archaeology, Minford’s benign version seems unlikely. Although
Minford is a deservedly renowned translator, his Western Zhou
reconstruction seems not to have removed all traces of the book of
wisdom reading of the Changes.

       38. Commentary 睽 Kui Opposition
The tag character appears only in 38.4 and 38.6. It can mean
separated as well as opposed.

38.0 A standard divinatory phrase.

38.1 The theme of not having to search for what has been lost is
a recurrent one in the Zhouyi. Seeing a deformed person would be
assumed to be bad luck but we are reassured that it will not be so
in relation to this circumstance. In a well-known anecdote, a son
with a clubfoot is denied permission to carry out the rituals for
ancestors as he is not a complete human being. Such superstitions
further hindered the lives of people with physical abnormalities by
causing them to be shunned as bringing bad luck. This prejudice
has only partly been overcome. Some years ago I witnessed this in
Cambodia when our guide told us not to give money to beggars
who had lost legs from land mines. Some, she told us, even owned
motorbikes, as if they were somehow at fault themselves for having
mutilated bodies. Such attitudes are suppressed in the developed
countries, but sometimes persist.
   Rutt makes the interesting suggestion that the lost horse may
be a constellation that will reappear as the earth rotates (331).
There are many such elements in the Zhouyi that could well
refer to astronomical events, but so far as I am aware, Chinese
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    223



commentarial traditions have not given much attention to this
mode of exegesis. Cosmology was greatly elaborated during the
Han Dynasty, but tended toward virtual, calculating star positions
rather than actually observing them.
   Yin-yang and wu xing (five phrases) cycles served as metaphysical
models for all natural and human phenomena. While this cosmology
was added to the I Ching rather than being intrinsic to it, it
contributed to the influence of the I Ching, even into the modern
era. Joseph Needham blamed the Changes for being a major factor
inhibiting the development of science in China (Redmond and
Hon: 158–70).
   Rutt points out that several possible astrological references
in the line texts such as “heavenly horse,” or “man leading an
ox,” are also names of asterisms. Since these play little role in the
later Confucian received tradition of interpretation, they seem
to hint at an alternate, perhaps esoteric, tradition of reading the
Changes. If so, it would have been read on two levels, one in
which the texts refer to matters of daily life, including omens, and
the other as references to astrology. However, I have not found
a systematic reading based on the calendrical and astronomical
meanings of characters. This is an aspect of the Changes that
could reward more study. I have pointed out some astronomical
references but generally translated based on the more concrete
meanings. Pankenier is the most comprehensive consideration of
early Chinese astrology in English and includes a discussion of
astronomical phenomena (2013: 44–90 et passim). Astrology is
beginning to receive scholarly study as central to the thought of
the ancient world, only now overcoming dismissal as superstition
unworthy of serious consideration.

38.2 This line is somewhat obscure. Perhaps it means: when one
meets a superior out of sight of others, one is less likely to be
blamed for omitting correct ritual courtesies.

38.3 As I have translated, the second phrase means, “not only has
fate made him an ox-cart driver, it has even caused him to have his
nose cut off.” Mutilating punishments were standard for all sorts
of offenses. These included tattooing on the face, cutting off the
nose, cutting off the feet, and castration. Such people were almost
certainly socially shunned. There is little record of how these
224	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



unfortunates managed to survive. Often physical punishments were
remitted upon payment of a fine. Thus the affluent were usually
spared. In a notorious episode of the Han Dynasty, the founder of
Chinese historical writing, Sima Qian (d. 86 bce), was castrated—
his friends refused to lend him the money to prevent the castration.
This punishment not only prevented sexual pleasure, it induced
further shame as making it impossible to carry out the filial duty
of fathering children.
   Here tian means heaven as arbitrary fate; the implication is
that the oxcart driver lost his nose because of bad luck rather
than misconduct on his part. Chinese attitudes toward fate were
mixed. In the later classics, notably the Dao De Jing and the
Lunyu, Heaven is an impersonal entity that regulates the cosmos.
Humans frequently violate the Way of Heaven; this causes personal
disasters and social disruption. For this reason, even minor ritual
errors can have serious consequences. Confucius often spoke of
heaven but famously declined to discuss anomalies, along with
spirits and feats of strength. This reticence was one factor that led
Leibniz, Voltaire, and other Enlightenment philosophes interested
in China to imagine it as a totally rational society. Not only the
Chinese but medieval Western philosophers kept the rational and
the supernatural in separate mental compartments, as indeed many
people do today.
   The last phrase may be a proverb about human life, meaning
either that although one does not know when one’s troubles began,
they will come to an end. Or perhaps more philosophically, that we
do not know our birth but do know we will die.

38.4 This is the sort of line text that makes the Zhouyi seem so
confusing. It is an odd mixture of elements that seem unrelated.
The obscurity dissipates somewhat once one realizes that it refers
to a solitary person seeing a forced laborer, or perhaps that being
solitary, he has no choice but to join with this person. This could
be an omen, as in 4.3. This might be calamitous but if the final
prognosis applies to this phrase, blame will be avoided. Indeed,
an important function of Zhouyi divination seems to have been to
help the inquirer avert the ill consequences of such an omen. The
second phrase has no evident relation to the first, unless the laborer
is assigned to guarding captives, but one would expect a soldier to
be given this responsibility.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                       225



    The variety of proposed emendations and translations of yu is
unusually extensive, even for the Zhouyi. These are summarized
by Rutt (31). Another example is emendation of 孤 gu, orphan, to
狐 hu, fox (Rutt: 210, 261, 331. See also Kunst: 314f.; Field 2015:
170f.). They speculate that this may have been a reference to Sirius,
the Dog Star. While this speculation is plausible, the meaning as
orphan is supported by the child radical 子 zi being one of its
components.
    While the mode of thought that assumes chance sightings may
portend disaster is foreign to us, traces survive in familiar super-
stitions such as a black cat crossing one’s path. What is revealed
in this, as in many other passages in the Zhouyi, is the extreme
fearfulness induced by supernatural beliefs. This is brought out
well by Constance Cook who describes the extreme apprehension
of a middle-level government official afflicted with an incurable
disease, who has traveled frequently, possibly incurring the enmity
of the local spirits he had not known how to propitiate.

38.5 Obviously the ancestors cannot actually bite the meat. The
biting is not literal and the offering was likely later consumed
by those offering the sacrifice. Fu 膚 meat can also have the
implication of human flesh. Cannibalism may well have been part
of some human sacrifices, but most historical texts gloss over this
gruesome possibility and scholars have tended to avoid it also.

38.6 This line repeats the initial two words of 38.4. One is alone
and beset and sees a mud-covered pig—this being the usual state of
pigs penned on farms. Being alone was likely an unusual situation
in traditional China—and even now as anyone who has traveled in
the Chinese countryside is well aware. The phrase probably reflects
the anxiety of being alone and unprotected. The pig might be an
omen that the orphan will find something to eat, perhaps by stealing
the pig. In traditional China, as in the West until relatively recently,
there were many homeless wanderers begging or making a living as
herb-sellers, story-tellers, diviners, and other ways, not all honest.
   The remainder of this line text is a jumble of seemingly unrelated
omens. Rutt shows that the ghostly cart, pig, and archer are likely
astrological references (332). Nonetheless, as I have already noted,
such were probably read on at least two levels, as natural omens
and as celestial ones.
226	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



    The third phrase seems to be a proverb, somewhat akin to the
supposed maxim of the American Wild West, “Shoot first and ask
questions later.” Rutt suggests the reference to bandits is about
mock bride-stealing. Alternatively, a wedding ceremony might also
be a common target for robbers, as wealth would be on display. If
fei 匪 is taken as “bandits” rather than “not,” the line becomes the
opposite to how I have rendered it: “Bandits invade the wedding.”
The Fuyang manuscript has fei written as 非, making “not” the
more likely reading (160). However, with homophonic characters,
it is often impossible to resolve ambiguity with certainty.
    In contrast to modern urban life, in agricultural societies rain
was always welcome.

Beneficial to see the important person.
上六往蹇; 來碩吉. 利見大人.



       39. Commentary 蹇 Jian Stumbling
This word could also be translated as “limping” or “crippled.”
Though absent in the judgment, the tag character is repeated in
each of the line texts, giving this hexagram an unusual degree of
thematic unity. Contrary to the usual denigration of any sort of
handicap in the Zhouyi, in this hexagram those who stumble seem
to end up favorably. The divinatory significance of this is quite
clear—struggling with a task ultimately pays off.

39.0 The directions could also be translated as southwest and
northeast but early Chinese texts usually refer to the four cardinal
directions. Associations of directions with favorable or unfavorable
prognoses are usual in Chinese divinations. Years ago, I myself
received a warning from a palm reader in a Gaoxiong night market
to avoid traveling to the south and west. I did so anyway and
became severely ill. This has not made me a believer in palmistry
but did serve to fix the episode in my memory.
    The usual translation of da ren 大人 as with Wilhelm-Baynes
is, “great man.” Because this sounds both snobbish and sexist to
contemporary readers, I have used important person. This is not to
gloss over the fact that traditional China was rigidly hierarchical
and subordinated women. However, as elsewhere I see no reason
to add gender when it is not in the original.

39.1 This seems to mean that one is praised for coming despite
the effort indicated by stumbling. In his translation of the slightly
different Mawangdui version, Shaughnessy has, “Going afoot,
coming in a cart” (76f.). This is consistent with the received version
in suggesting that the going is difficult but the return is better,
rather than lameness being miraculously cured.

39.2 It would seem that bowing before the king would be
intentional, so this likely refers to awkward body posture.

39.3 The Fuyang manuscript has an additional phrase, 卜病不死
bu bing bu si, “Divining about sickness: they will not die …”
(Shaughnessy 2014: 262). There are only a few such additional
phrases in the excavated manuscripts. It seems best to resist the
temptation to conjecture if such phrases were lost in the received
text or added to a later one.

39.4 and 39.5 These lines seem to suggest some sort of mutual
help. Given the arrival of guests, this might be a social occasion
resulting in drunkenness.

         40 Commentary 解 Jie Release
While 40.4 and 40.5 include the tag character, there is no general
theme related to releasing. Hacker suggests that the tag refers
back to that for 39, for which he translated the character as
“obstruction” (54). However, with some exceptions, such as
hexagrams 1 and 2 and 63 and 64, the tags mostly seem unrelated
to the line texts, though later literati commentators found ways to
read the tags so that they seemed to fit the hexagram figure and
the line texts.
   Most of the line texts are about hunting or the disposition of
captives. The tag 解 can mean releasing, but also separating or
cutting. Thus 40.5 could mean cutting the captives, rather than
releasing them. Given the rather grim fate of captives in the Zhouyi,
the former is plausibly the early meaning but I have chosen to grant
amnesty to these captives by choosing to translate as “releasing.”

40.0 The final phrase sounds like a proverb, though a rather
obvious one.

40.2 Hu 狐 clearly means “fox” here. Likely finding an arrowhead
was lucky and a bronze one would have had significant monetary
value. At one time in the United States, finding stone Native
American arrowheads was considered lucky. They were still passed
around frequently when I was a child, though I was unable to judge
their authenticity.

40.3 The first phrase sounds like a proverb, “If you let your
possessions be too visible, robbers are likely to come.”

40.4 The first phrase is obscure, but might mean releasing bound
captives, or releasing a bowstring, presumably to shoot the captives.
Alternatively, Rutt suggests, it could refer to cutting off the thumbs
	            TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                  233



of captives (334f.). The Fuyang and Mawangdui manuscripts shed
no light on this passage.

40.5 As I have translated this obscure passage, the high-ranking
person is released but those of low rank are kept prisoner.

40.6 Success in hunting was important for the powerful to
maintain their aura.

       41. Commentary 損 Sun Decrease
Sun occurs in all the line texts except 41.5. The sorts of decrease
however are quite different, so the basis of inclusion of the line
texts is the character, rather than a common theme. Lines 41.2
and 41.6 both include the set phrase, “neither decreasing nor
increasing.”

41.0 A gui is a round bowl for holding grain known from the
Shang Dynasty. When used for offerings it would presumably be
bronze, but early examples are pottery.

41.1 The first phrase has often been translated as meaning that a
sacrifice should be performed quickly (Shaughnessy: 293; Kunst:
320f.; Rutt: 264). This is plausible, but my own view is that as
often as the Zhouyi refers to sacrifice, that does not mean that any
incomplete phrase should be interpreted as being about sacrifice.
This might be a terse proverb to the effect that finishing a task
averts blame.
   The final phrase seems to be a proverb to the effect, “If you
pour your wine, you will have less left.” When it is offered to the
spirits, one has less left for oneself, perhaps a wry comment on the
cost of sacrifice, which consumed a quite significant portion of the
resources of many early cultures.

41.2 As noted previously zhen g 征 can mean a military campaign
as well as a long journey. As both would be dangerous, neither
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     237



would have been undertaken without divination. As often in the
Zhouyi, context is too slight to determine the correct meaning with
any certainty.
   “Neither decreasing nor increasing,” is a set phrase, something
like English, “Neither here not there,” or French, “Comme ci,
comme ça.” It remains a common phrase in modern Chinese.

41.3 On its face, this is a rather odd phrase, given that walking
in a group of three does not predispose to losing one, nor
does a solitary person necessarily gain a friend. It might be a
numerological prognostication—under the circumstances divined
about, it would be better to walk alone than in a group of three.
There is a somewhat similar phrase in the Lunyu, that when three
walk together one will be the teacher, meaning that people should
always be learning from each other. It is a familiar phrase in
modern Chinese. Alternatively, the phrase in the Zhouyi might be
an ancient version of the proverb, “Two’s company but three’s a
crowd.” That is, three are likely to quarrel, while being by oneself
invites others to befriend you.

41.4 This is a straightforward suggestion that could be uttered
today, “If someone is ill, cheer him or her up.” Such references
to being kind to others are infrequent in the Zhouyi. Norman
Cousins, editor of the once prestigious Saturday Review, was
widely hailed as an innovator when he published a book claiming
to have cured his illness (probably a form of arthritis) by reading
humorous books to make himself laugh. The idea that happiness is
good for health is an ancient one.

41.5 This is usually translated as meaning that ten cowry shells
are traded for a tortoise shell. At least to me this does not seem
like a good deal. Most oracle bones are ox scapulae rather than
tortoise plastrons because the latter were rare and expensive—at
times the tortoise population became severely depleted because of
use for plastromancy, and perhaps for longevity soup as well. It
seems that the owner of the tortoise shell could not refuse the offer,
presumably because the exchange was with the king or another
powerful person. Later Chinese history has numerous examples of
emperors who “borrowed” items, such as valuable calligraphy or
paintings. These were, of course, never returned.

42.6 Nothing advantageous, perhaps attacked, be resolute of heart.
Do not persist when ominous.
上九莫益之. 或擊之立心. 勿恆凶.



       42. Commentary 益 Yi Advantage
Wilhelm-Baynes translate the tag as Increase to make it an antonym
of 41 Decrease, but this is an approximation, not strictly correct.
No doubt this was done because the hexagrams are inversions of
each other. In the Mawangdui version, the two hexagrams are not
juxtaposed; 41 and 42 are 12 and 64 respectively, though the tags
are the same.

42.0 The first two lines are set phrase prognostications, whose
metaphorical meanings are straightforward. Favorable to see the
great person reminds us that approaching someone powerful at
the wrong time can be hazardous and with a despotic ruler, even
fatal. Even now, when asking for a favor, most are conscious of
the mood of boss, parent, even spouse. Favorable to cross the
wide river is a metaphor for any difficult or potentially hazardous
undertaking, as well as for present day international travel. (As an
example, I did a divination demonstration as part of a program
on the I Ching and obtained the negative of this—not favorable to
cross the great water. It turned out that the inquirer’s fiancé wanted
her to move to China but she did not want to. I do not know what
she finally decided but in this simple example we can see how this
sort of general statement can resonate with the inquirer. I make
no claims of supernatural talent but find such demonstrations
useful to show what the experience of divination with the Changes
is like.)

42.2 The first phrase repeats 41.5. The final phrase refers to Di 帝
or Shangdi 上帝, a deity who was worshipped in the Shang; this
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      241



practice carried over into the Zhou, but is not referred to elsewhere
in the Zhouyi. Missionaries of some denominations, trying to find
an analogue of monotheism in Chinese religion, claimed that Di
actually referred to the Judeo-Christian creator God. This was used
to claim that ancient China had Christian-like religious ideas that
had degenerated into polytheism. We know relatively little about
worship of Shangdi, but there is no basis for assuming monotheism
in early China. Tian 天, Heaven, came to replace Shangdi in the
Zhou and later. Both were transcendent, impersonal entities.

42.3 and 42.4 Walking in the center probably had ritual significance.
Presumably what was reported to the duke was the capture of
prisoners or their sacrifice.
   Capitals were moved in the Shang and many times in later
Chinese history.

42.5 It is unusual for the Zhouyi to recommend being compassionate
to captives. I have taken this line text to mean that one can be kind
to captives, and still use them to display one’s power. However, it
is not certain that compassion to captives is here recommended.
Indeed, de here could mean potency as a result of carrying out the
sacrifice, which might involve removal and display of the hearts.
Despite the harshness of Western Zhou life as represented in the
Changes, we should not conclude that the era was entirely without
compassion.
   Though human sacrifice did not cease with the defeat of the
Shang, it did gradually diminish. Tracing the history of this
gruesome practice is difficult as most texts refer to blood sacrifice
tangentially if at all.

42.6 This seems to be advice that when circumstances are
unfavorable, one should be strong, but abstain from doing what is
hazardous. For quite different readings see Kunst (323) and Rutt
(265, 324) who take it to be a reference to a ritual to fix one’s luck.
This is plausible, but unprovable. Hence I have stayed with what
seems to me to be the literal meaning.

43. Commentary 夬 Guai Determination
Resoluteness seems too abstract a character trait for the Western
Zhou, hence I have substituted “determination.” The tag can,
though with some strain, be applied to all the lines except 43.6.

43.0 This consists of a standard reference to captives, followed by
a line of advice and a prognostication.

43.1 One of many references to traveling by foot. There have been
two ways to translate this first line. Kunst, Rutt, and Shaughnessy
(201) translate to the effect that the foot is injured, consistent
with the second phrase. The first phrase, however, seems to mean
stepping forward vigorously, as rendered by Wilhelm-Baynes. Read
either way, the overall meaning clearly indicates a problem with
walking.

43.2 Night-time military actions would be worrisome unless
one’s own side is defeating an enemy whose soldiers are the ones
wailing. The last phrase might mean not to have pity rather than
not be disturbed or anxious. It could be read differently by different
readers.

43.3 “Sturdy cheekbones—will be ominous.” Some have taken
this as meaning injury to the cheekbone. Although Wang Bi took
this phrase to be a visual reference to the top yin line (Lynn: 407),
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      245



it must instead have been yet another reference to divination by
physiognomy. In such systems facial features have a prognostic
whose significance can be deciphered by those learned in their
interpretations. Similar systems exist in many cultures. The basis
for associating specific features to good and bad fortune is
rarely self-evident. China has many systems of divining from
body attributes, including breast shape. Folk practices of this
sort undoubtedly existed in the Western Zhou but most have
left no written record. The notion that high cheekbones are
dangerous persists in present-day China, supposedly because they
are knife-like.
    The rest of this line text seems to be a statement about character.
The upright person walks through the rain and, though naturally
irritated, does nothing shameful. As with later Confucian ethics,
virtue is here described as how the upright behave, rather than as
abstract principles.

43.4 The lack of skin on the buttocks might be due to a beating
or an abrasion, such as would occur with sliding down a hill. Or
perhaps it is a simile: walking as if no skin on his backside. Rutt
relates this to sacrificial victims—perhaps they were beaten before
being beheaded.
   I chose to let the sheep run away as without doubt they were
being led to sacrifice. However, it could be that leading the sheep
was a gesture of humility, as recounted in the Zuozhuan (Rutt:
335f.).
   Words heard but not believed has the sound of a set phrase
and describes a situation as common today as it likely was in the
Bronze Age.

43.5 This and the preceding line almost certainly refer to sacrificial
animals escaping. The final phrase means the person responsible
for the escape will not be blamed.

43.6 Rutt notes that Gao Heng proposed that 无 wu was a
homophone for “dog,” whose howling would have been a bad
omen. However, 號 hao wailing commonly appears in phrases
describing captives about to be sacrificed. The screaming of victims
was, at least in some circumstances, necessary for the efficacy of the
sacrifice. Hence lack of wailing would be ominous.

44.6 They meet with horns.
Shame, not blame.
上九姤其角. 吝, 无咎.



       44. Commentary 姤 Gou Meeting
Gou 姤 can refer to “meeting” in the usual sense but also to sexual
intercourse. With the notable exception of hexagram 18 Gu, the
Zhouyi contains few obvious references to sexual acts, in contrast
to the Shijing 诗经 and Chu Ci 楚辭 (Songs of Chu or Songs of the
South.) The line texts contain nothing sexual. The buttocks in 44.3
without skin have no conceivable erotic implication.

44.0 This may be the most misunderstood line in the entire I Ching,
having been translated as meaning that because the woman
is strong, she should not be taken as a wife (or concubine, or
servant), implying that a woman who is not suitably submissive
is to be avoided. Several notable translators have perpetuated
this mistranslation (Legge: 187; Wilhelm-Baynes: 171; Whincup:
148). As I have explained at length elsewhere (Redmond and Hon
2014: 82f.) the Chinese phrase simply says “the woman is strong,
do not choose her.” In traditional China, life expectancy for
women was only into the mid-twenties and death in childbirth was
frequent, making health a major factor in suitability for marriage.
In addition, food preparation and housework were physically
challenging, making robust or strong women desirable as members
of the household. Thus the line means not to choose her, even
though she is strong.
   The disapproval of feminine strength was added by later commen-
tators, notably Wang Bi, who projected his own misogyny onto the
Zhouyi (Lynn: 410f.).Wilhelm-Baynes followed this tradition by
rendering the line as “The maiden is powerful. One should not
marry such a maiden” (171).This was also read into the hexagram
figure, which consists of one yin line at the base with the other
five being yang lines, as if the female principle is furtively sneaking
back. While the Zhouyi can hardly be claimed to advocate female
equality, any misogyny supposedly found in it was the creation of
later interpreters (see Redmond and Hon 2014: 72–91).
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    249



44.1 The first phrase probably refers to a tied-up animal. The next
phrase refers to seeing a bad omen while traveling. Omens were not
simply warnings: they could cause the bad luck they implied. The
pacing of the pig may indicate agitation. Farm animals often can
tell they are about to be slaughtered by the sounds of other animals
and the smell of blood.

44.2 A bag with fish. It would seem that there is nothing wrong
with the fish but that they are not of adequate quality to serve
guests.

44.3 This reprises 43.4.

44.4 It is not surprising that picking up a bag with fish is lucky
while picking up one without fish is not. Fish symbolize abundance,
so this line is akin to, “The cupboard was bare” in English.

44.5 The second phrase has been translated in quite diverse ways. I
believe mine makes the most sense, but as so often with the Zhouyi,
that a translation makes sense does not prove it is correct. In any
case, the line clearly refers to ritual use of jade.

44.6 This likely refers to rams butting each other, but is perhaps
a double entendre also meaning sexual intercourse. If so, the final
phrase means that it was shameful but that they get away with it.

上六齎咨涕洟. 无咎.



       45. Commentary 萃 Cui Assembling
As most of this hexagram is about sacrifice, the tag could refer to
people gathering for this event. Field substitutes the homophone
瘁 cui meaning suffer (2015), which he suggests is supported by
the Mawangdui tag being 卒 zu finish or die (Shaughnessy 1997:
122f.). Suffering certainly describes the content of this hexagram,
with its wretched captives about to be sacrificed.

45.0 This describes the offering of a large animal, presumably an
ox, in sacrifice by or for the king. The most important way a ruler
provided for the well-being of his subjects was by correct ritual
performance. This was also required for credibility and thus for
maintenance of power. The Zhou overthrow of the Shang was
justified not only because of King Zhou Xin’s cruelty, but also
because he did not carry out the rituals properly (Redmond and
Hon: 57–62). Ritual remains relevant to effective government.
To pick an instance not long before the present writing, President
Obama was widely criticized on social media for an official
appearance at which he wore a tan suit rather than a dark one. We
still expect ritual correctness from those in government, but the
rules are unwritten.

45.1 I have translated 勿恤 wu xu as “do not sorrow” rather than
“do not pity” as I do not find much evidence of the latter emotion
in the Zhouyi. Yet my translation here of “no sorrow,” still leaves
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     253



the possibility of some sympathy while observing a sacrifice. No
doubt pity was not the proper emotion at such occasions, yet
we should not assume it was not felt, simply because it was not
mentioned. Wailing and tittering seems to be a stock description
of the vocalizations of victims about to be sacrificed. Alternatively,
it could be the victims wailing and the captors laughing, but we
have very little mention of captors’ feelings about the killing.
Laughter is possible however as taunting has been common at
public executions.

45.2 Yin 引 is based on a pictograph of a bow and means drawn
out. The Yue summer sacrifice is also mentioned in 46.2 and 63.5
(Rutt: 337). This phrase is an explicit statement of the belief that
killing captives is beneficial for the state. Given the many lines
recommending sacrifices, one wonders if there were ever situations
for which they were not recommended, or when a particular form
of sacrifice would not be welcomed by the presumed recipient.
Given that Confucian exegesis of the Changes censored references
to sacrifice, there was awareness on some level that it was wrong.
No doubt this is why the practice was gradually abandoned, but
how this came about we do not know. We have no record of
anything like the modern-day activism against the death penalty.
Public protests in early times were mainly due to famine or other
hardships. It was high officials who were able to influence king or
emperor.

45.4 “Greatly auspicious, nothing blameworthy.” Phrases like
this seem redundant but can be simply emphatic or, more likely,
a divination akin to a spell, in effect “May everything be greatly
auspicious and incur no blame to make the prognostication come
true.”

45.5 Fei 匪 here makes most sense as brigand. A less likely
alternative would be, “not blameworthy that there are no captives.”

45.6 This is a particularly vivid description of the misery of those
about to be sacrificed. In such instances it is hard to imagine
“there will be no blame” being anything other than a charm to
avert blame. Even if they believed that sacrifice was necessary,
bystanders at such events must have felt intense emotional agitation
254	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



and worry that their turn might come. Fear-averting procedures are
major components of magical systems: verbal formulae, talismans
(carried or eaten), amulets, relics, images of protective deities and
the like.

上六冥升, 利于不息之貞.


       46. Commentary 升 Sheng Going Up
The tag simply means rising. The tag is related to the line texts as all
but 46.2 are about going up. The chapter would be easily applied
to responding to divinatory inquiries since going up is a virtually
daily activity. In itself, this chapter is banal. Decisions about going
up steps do not seem momentous, even in an enchanted world.

46.0 Do not worry is a recurring set phrase. Seeing an important
person, undertaking a journey, marching against an enemy would
all be anxious undertakings. A positive prognosis and a spell to
bring about a positive outcome would be frequently useful.

46.3 This might be a reference to 空城計 the “empty fortress or city
stratagem,” number 32 of the well-known Thirty-six Stratagems.
In this maneuver, those in the besieged city act deceptively calm,
misleading the enemy to suspect a trap. If the line is an allusion
to this stratagem, we need not assume that the Zhouyi compiler
knew the specific text, or that it even existed in written form at the
time, simply that the phrase was in use. However, the Thirty-six
Stratagems seems a more advanced text than the Zhouyi as it
offers specific tactical advice rather than simple prognostications
of auspicious or ominous.

46.4 In context, “there will be no blame” has the implication that
the ritual was properly performed.

46.6 This sounds like a proverb—when in a potentially hazardous
place, keep moving. It suggests postponing divination when in
exigent circumstances, and that in urgent circumstances even
divination is best postponed. This is of interest because it indicates
that even in the enchanted Western Zhou, common sense could
prevail over supernatural beliefs.

47.6 Obstructed by creeping vines, worried and unsteady
Says: moving regretted, has repented—expedition auspicious.
上六困于葛藟, 臲卼. 曰動悔有悔, 征吉.



   47. Commentary 困 Kun Obstruction
The theme of obstruction is carried out in all the line texts, which
share the general theme of facing oppressive circumstances that
interfere with one’s activities. The references to rocks and brambles
were likely proverbial ways of referring to difficulties, equivalent
to our, “Between a rock and a hard place.” The image would be
particularly meaningful during a time when traveling was often
along footpaths or narrow dirt roads that would often have been
overgrown.

47.0 This repeats by now familiar stock phrases. Words not being
trusted is the same phrase as 43.4, but which I have translated
slightly differently as, “there are words but not believed.”

47.1 Instead of tun 臀 (buttocks), the Mawangdui silk manuscript
has a homophone 脣 chun, meaning lips or labia (Shaughnessy
1996: 310). Given that the received text refers to buttocks and a
deep valley, there is almost certainly an erotic implication here. It
could plausibly refer to sexual intercourse in a wooded area—no
doubt a common place for such encounters, given the general lack
of privacy. “Three years” could refer to an interval of reclusion,
perhaps because of a political falling-out or the mourning period
for parents. Given the sexual reference, separation from the loved
one seems equally plausible—this being a universal poetic theme.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                       259



47.2 No food or drink might be a period of required fasting.
Zhu fu 朱紱 is a garment for ritual use for sacrifice performed in a
specific direction (Rutt: 228f.). Directionality of sacrifice may have
been based on belief as to where the ancestor or deity was thought
to be located.

47.3 Obstructed by rocks—grasp at brambles.
This seems to be a proverb, that when prevented from accom-
plishing something, choose another way, however unpleasant—the
lesser evil in effect. Not seeing his wife is likely an omen of bad luck
rather than a reference to a marriage problem. However, given the
oppressiveness of many women’s lives, it could be that she has run
away. No doubt many women of households did flee oppressive
circumstances but many would likely be forced to return, not
having any means to survive on their own.

47.4 A bronze-covered chariot would have been a sign of great
wealth. It is tempting to take this as a proverb to the effect that
even the wealthy can be blocked from their goals.

47.5 The vermillion ceremonial garment was previously mentioned
in 47.2 I have taken it to be a metonymy for an official. My
translation to the effect that the official stops the mutilating
punishment is perhaps wishful thinking on my part.

47.6 The first phrase shares with 47.1 and 47.3 the theme of being
hindered by vegetation and terrain. Yue 曰 appears also in 26.3.
There is much speculation about its meaning (Bernardo 2012:
259f.). Of interest, this is the character throughout the Lunyu
that introduces utterances by Confucius: “Zi yue,” the Master
said. However, there is no notion of an authoritative speaker or
“master” in the Zhouyi, though the phrase is found in the Ten
Wing-like appendices of the Mawangdui I Ching and in many
other Chinese classics (Shaughnessy 1996: 126 et passim).

       48. Commentary 井 Jing The Well
Since water is essential to life, wells were of great importance. The
abundance and purity of their water would have been of great
concern. The line texts of this chapter are various statements about
wells.

48.0 This is a proverb, still in use among Chinese in somewhat
different form, “Depart your village, leave your well,” implying
leaving one’s village is to leave the source of one’s life. Here in the
Zhouyi, it seems also to refer to the fact that a city, which is entirely
a human construction, can be moved almost anywhere, but a well
cannot, as it depends on finding the water table. Consequently,
availability of water would have been a major prerequisite for
locating towns.
   Here the set phrase of no loss; no gain seems to have a specific
concrete reference—the level of water in a well remains constant,
no matter how much is drawn out.
   Yi 亦 is also the eighth earthly branch, associated with early
afternoon and with the sheep in the so-called animal zodiac, but
does not seem to have these meanings in context. Such references
to time would have been apparent to diviners, but we do not
know what role they played in the divination. Considerable work
has been done regarding later Chinese hemerology, the branch
of divination intended to determine timing of events (Kalinowski
2003: 213–99).

48.1 Wells must often have been contaminated with animal and
human feces that would have been washed in by rain, bringing
bacteria and parasite larvae. Though there was no germ theory of
disease, it would have been known that bad water was dangerous.
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    263



Animals deserting a well could mean that it was dried up or grossly
contaminated so as to make the water unpotable. While disease
would have spread rapidly when a contaminated well was used
by an entire village, tainted water would not necessarily have been
recognized as the cause. Muddy water need not be infected and
infected water can be perfectly clear.

48.2 Shooting fish in a well seems odd. Perhaps the well was used to
keep the fish alive until it was time to cook them. The Mawangdui
silk manuscript has different characters meaning “worn out fish
trap” (Shaughnessy 1997: 299 n.8).This suggests that the fish were
shot because the trap was not working.

48.3 Literally 明 ming means luminous or bright. In context
it likely praises the ritual power of the king and the power of
his favor. Given that royal rituals were essential to maintaining
society, perhaps here the king was expected to use his supernatural
charisma to improve the condition of the well or to locate another.

48.4 Water in a brick-lined well would presumably be less likely
to be muddy. The formula, “there will be no blame” might mean
that the earth spirits were not disturbed by the construction of the
brick lining.

48.5 The well water is pleasant to drink.

48.6 This possibly refers to sacrificing captives so the well would
provide enough water. In many agricultural societies, human
sacrifice was considered necessary to maintain the earth’s bounty.

49. Commentary 革 Ge Tanning Leather
The tag for this hexagram is usually translated into English
as “Revolution” (Hacker 1993: 56; Whincup: 162; Wilhelm-
Baynes: 189). This is problematic on several grounds. First, the
early meaning of the phrase was definitely tanning leather, and
by analogy, change, because the tanning process transforms raw
animal skin into leather. The Mawangdui manuscript has 勒
le specifically meaning “bridle,” obviously related to the early
meaning of “leather” (Shaughnessy 1997: 129, 311).
   Most important, considering the eventual canonical status of
the Changes, no ruler would endorse a divinatory system that
might recommend his overthrow. Nor would the Confucians
whose power, and even survival, depended on their being trusted
by the emperor. In the Confucian ideology, there was no place
for rebellion; if their admonitions to the emperor went unheeded,
they were to withdraw from government, not rebel against it. As
Confucius said of the sage:

   When the Way prevails in the world; he appears; when the Way
   is lacking, he retires. (Lunyu 8.13, in Watson 2007: 56)

This ideology did not, of course, prevent rebellions, but
Confucianism did not provide their ideological justification. They
might of course decide that a new regime had the mandate of
heaven in order to be employed by it.

49.0 As usual, events begin with a human sacrifice. Somehow it has
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     267



been determined that this should be done on a si day, the sixth of
the earthly branches used in the sixty-day calendrical system. That
this is followed by the standard four-character invocation raises
the question of how often Zhouyi divinations were preceded by
such sacrifices. It seems unlikely to have been the routine practice
because the classic lent itself to getting quick answers without a
major effort. Nor do we have any textual evidence for sacrifices as
part of Zhouyi procedures. Such is not mentioned in the Zuozhuan
Changes divination anecdotes.

49.1 and 49.2 This must mean that the prisoners are to be bound
with tanned hide.

49.3 The second phrase likely refers to a ritual recitation to precede
the sacrifice.

49.5 and 49.6 The phrases “tiger change” and “leopard change”
have baffled many readers. Note that the word for change
here is not the hexagram tag 革 ge, nor 易 yi as in Zhouyi or I
Ching, but an entirely different word 變 bian. This can refer to
a transformation, particularly the seasonal change of an animal’s
coat. Tiger change and leopard change make sense if regarded as
shamanic. Men in high positions could enhance their charisma
by shamanic activities involving imitating animals. In context
here, this means the important person and upright person would
take on the mythical attributes of the tiger and leopard, though
we are not told what these attributes are. Some have translated
the phrases as referring to wearing the hides of the animals. This
is possible, especially given that many phrases in this hexagram
refer to animal skins, but still leaves the significance obscure.
Shamanism was widely practiced in early China and later, though
despised by many Confucians. Their official disapproval did not
necessarily mean that they did not occasionally avail themselves of
the services of shamans. Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130–1200) for example,
the main progenitor of the Neo-Confucian orthodoxy that lasted
until the fall of the Qing, had high regard for shamanism (Sukhu
2012: 76 et passim).

49.6 That the petty person only changes his face seems to be
saying that the upright person (or prince) can make a basic change
268	          THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



in himself, while the unimportant one can only change his facial
expression. The implication is similar to the modern phrase,
“two-faced.”

   50. Commentary 鼎 Ding The Bronze
              Cauldron
A ding 鼎 is a three-legged ancient bronze vessel, shaped like the
picture above. The basic shape has great aesthetic appeal and
had many subsequent imitations, particularly during the Song
Dynasty. So many of these vessels were made that they are to be
found in virtually any museum with a Chinese collection. They
were used for ritual food preparations and often had inscriptions
commemorating an important event, such as enfeoffment of a
noble. (Regarding inscriptions, see Shaughnessy [1991]. For some
beautifully photographed examples, see National Palace Museum
[2001].)
   The character 鼎, which is identical in the Mawangdui
manuscript, is pictographic and the hexagram itself can also be
imagined to resemble the bronze vessel with the divided line at the
base representing the legs and the divided line at position 5, the
handles. One can infer that this hexagram was selected to represent
the ding theme, but we actually have no direct evidence of how
each hexagram came to be associated with specific sets of texts.

50.0 A variant invocation; presumably the offering is to be made
with the ding.

50.1 This may be based on the notion that minor mishaps can avert
worse bad luck.
   Qie 妾, which I have translated as concubine, in the oracle
bone inscriptions can refer to a female sacrificial victim. In
contrast to these centuries-earlier texts, the Zhouyi does not
specify the gender of victims except for the horse in 2.0. Most are
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     271



孚 fu, captives—presumably male soldiers of a defeated enemy.
Usually, though not always, victims were selected from outside the
sacrificers’ own tribe or society. Women and children were also
sacrificed, but our knowledge of the details of human sacrifice is
largely based on archaeology rather than textual evidence, so we
know little about how victims were selected. There is no indication
of sacrifice of women and children in the Zhouyi.
   Here and in the only other use of the character, in 33.3, the
meaning is clearly servant or concubine. A common reason for
taking an additional wife was failure of the first to produce a son.
This was virtually always assumed to be the fault of the woman.
With no knowledge of the physiology of reproduction, other than
the need for fertilization by the male, explanations were arbitrary,
curses being a frequent supposed reason for barrenness.
   Examples of following-in-death, that is wives, servants, and
others being buried with the deceased, are known as late as the
Ming Dynasty. The episode of Iphigenia in the Iliad is a well-
known literary example of human sacrifice, and tells us that such
was not necessarily a happy occasion for anyone involved; rather it
was thought necessary. Only recently have scholars of early culture
been willing to give this practice due attention. For a useful survey,
see Bremmer (2007).

50.2 我 wo, the first person pronoun, appears only eleven times
in the Zhouyi. More often, as in modern Chinese, subjects of
sentences were understood rather than stated. Chinese pronouns
do not have different forms to distinguish between singular and
plural. In this case where there is a military implication, the foes
have been soldiers in the opposing army, so the plural fits better.

50.3 This line text has attracted very diverse interpretations, though
its meaning seems to be clear enough. Pheasants have been hunted
throughout Chinese history to the present day. That the fatty meat
is not eaten is likely a negative omen, much like the animal not
bleeding when stabbed. High fat content was considered desirable
in meat until quite recently. Diminished rain, like the pheasant fat
not eaten, suggests a state of scarcity.

50.4 This line recounts a disturbing anecdote, one often expurgated
in both Confucian exegesis and Western language translations. The
272	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



setting is a ritual meal during which one of the three legs of the ding
tripod breaks, spilling the duke’s meal on him. Wilhelm-Baynes
translate, “The prince’s meal is spilled. / And his person is soiled.”
Kunst, based on careful analysis of possible character variants,
takes 形 xing to mean execution or other severe punishment and
translates 形渥 xing wo as, “execution in chamber” (433–5). This
is yet another instance of the arbitrary violence of early China.
Given the great importance placed on proper ritual observance for
the well-being of the ruler and the country as a whole, any error
could be regarded as a serious breach. An alternative explanation
is that the spilling was a pretext for the duke to rid himself of an
enemy, as described in another famous anecdote in which a general
is executed for being late to a meeting with the king. Kunst further
notes that to be executed privately rather than in the marketplace
was a “privilege” of nobility. This can be likened to the “right”
of English nobility to be beheaded in the Tower of London, rather
than publicly hanged like common thieves.

50.5 and 50.6 The cauldron would have been placed over a fire
and so would be too hot to be grasped by its handles. Instead a
special hook was used, or a rod passed through the handles on both
sides. The cauldron is yellow, the original color of bronze before it
develops the patina that we see on museum pieces.

       51. Commentary 震 Zhen Thunder
Zhen 震 is the title of the trigram that is doubled up to form this
hexagram.
    It is usually taken to mean thunder, though it can denote other
startling or shocking events, such as earthquakes. This hexagram
has an unusual number of repeated characters. Thunder is the first
word in each line text. In lines 51.0, 51.1, 51.3, and 51.6, thunder
is followed by one or two sets of doubled-up terms, all expressing
the alarm the thunder evokes. The repetition is for emphasis,
but also mimics the repetitive claps of thunder. Unique to this
hexagram are the emphatic expressions of emotion. Most emotion
mentioned in the Zhouyi is unhappy. Thunder, however, is not
truly harmful and so the tone here is basically silly; one wonders if
it derived from a mnemonic to teach vocabulary to children. It may
also be a collection of thunder-derived omens.
    The tag in the Mawangdui text is chen 辰 (Shaughnessy 1997:
300). This is the lower component of the character in the received
version, so perhaps simply an abbreviation. Chen also refers to the
third month of the solar year when agricultural labor begins, to the
fifth earthly branch, 7 to 9 a.m., and to asterisms associated with
this season. Such may have been part of the now forgotten esoteric
hemerological system that I have postulated.
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      275



51.0 The laughter may be nervousness or, as Rutt suggests,
a positive sign in that thunder was thought to induce ease in
childbirth (343). However, even in a polygamous household,
childbirth would have been infrequent and there is no direct
reference to it here. The thunder is auspicious in 51.1, harmless in
51.3, but harmful in 51.5, indicating that as an omen it would be
interpreted differently in different circumstances. A li, or “Chinese
mile” is generally held to be about one-third of a Western mile, but
the exact length varied over time. A hundred li in such statements
is taken to be an approximation—“a long way.”
    Not spooning the wine might be to avoid spilling it if startled, or
a ritual taboo against offering wine during a thunderstorm.

51.1 Here again, laughing is associated with fear, but seemingly
in relief when it is realized that the loud noise is only harmless
thunder. The final word of this line text is “auspicious,” which
seems paradoxical. Possibly the thunder is auspicious because of the
relief when it is realized to be harmless. However, as so many times
in the Zhouyi, the meanings of omens are counter-intuitive. Why
this should be so is not entirely clear, except that the human brain is
hard-wired to think in terms of opposites. Nor should we ignore the
obvious fact that diviners, then as now, had to present their findings
so as to please their clients. Giving a powerful person a bad reading
could be hazardous to the health of the savant doing the divination.

51.2 Bei 貝 cowry shells were used as money. I have translated
yi 億 as many thousands. Literally it meant 100,000, later 100
million, but such numbers simply meant a very large quantity.
Finding, let alone carrying, so many shells is not plausible. Sang 喪
makes more sense as a funeral offering or payment for funeral
expenses than something accidentally lost. The third phrase likely
refers to climbing up a burial mound to offer the sacrifice, as in the
Mawangdui version (Shaughnessy 1997: 87, 300). Rutt suggests
that “nine” means “all” in this context, or to a place name (343).
I have speculated that the tomb was visited nine times. In any case,
the line indicates a ritual observance.
   The final phrase is a set one, referring to return in the usual
seven days without the need to pursue, as in 38.1, which advises
that one’s horse will return of its own accord. It seems unlikely to
refer back to the cowry shells.
276	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



51.6 In the final phrase 婚媾 hungou makes the most sense as
referring to a marriage agreement. By themselves, these characters
mean intercourse within marriage. Clouds and rain was a
euphemism for sexual activity and this might be the reason this
phrase was included in the Thunder hexagram. Mawangdui has a
phrase translated as “confused slander” (Shaughnessy 1997: 25f.,
300). Perhaps this was a later allusion to its sexual implication.
That marriage agreement and intercourse use the same terms
remind us that in ancient times the most important reason for
marriage, though not the sole one, was having children. Here as
with other sexual references in the Changes, the standard English
translations evade the direct meanings. This may have been due not
only to Confucian prudery but also to that of the early missionary
translators. To be fair however, Richard Rutt, though at first an
Anglican missionary to Korea and much later a Roman Catholic
priest, was the most forthright about these implications.

       52. Commentary 艮 Gen Splitting
This is an unusually interesting hexagram for what it reveals about
the early Zhouyi in all its untidiness. In the received version and
most commentaries gen 艮 is usually taken to mean mountain,
based on the later meaning that was assigned to the doubled
trigram that makes up the hexagram. Alternatively, it is translated
as “keeping still,” for which mountain is an obvious metaphor.
Shaughnessy translates as,“stilling,” based on the Mawangdui tag,
the homophone gen 根 meaning root, consistent with being still
(Shaughnessy 1997: 55; 2014: 274).
   Both Kunst and Rutt, based on the suggestion of Gao Heng,
translate gen as “cleaving” meaning cutting up a body. In context
this is clearly correct. Wilhelm-Baynes and other translations that
read it as stilling the specified body areas are strained at best, particu-
larly in reference to the spine in 52.3. Other renderings include “at
rest” (Legge: 219–21), “gnawing” (Waley: 134), and “tending” in
the sense of tending to one’s body (Minford 2014: 721).
   As these are all learned translators, albeit with quite different
viewpoints regarding the classic, a single correct meaning cannot
be decided with certainty. Given that “mountain” was clearly not
the early Western Zhou meaning, the other translations can be put
into three categories: references to body regions, presumably of the
person inquired for; splitting up a body, either as human sacrifice,
or as butchering of an animal; or involuntary bodily movements, as
such are known to have been taken as omens. However, the texts
make no direct reference to twitches, birthmarks or other bodily
signs that could be read as omens. Based on the above, the meaning
as cutting up a body, probably animal, seems to me inescapable.
   Butchering of animals would have been daily sights in farms;
temple sacrifices and marketplace executions would have been
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    279



familiar sights as well. I do, however, doubt Rutt’s conclusion that
the bodily disruption here is of a human. Other than his preoc-
cupation with this practice, I see no evidence for a human rather
than animal victim and the quotation from the Odes that he cites
is about cutting up a bull, not a human (344). The thousands of
skeletons of sacrificial victims discovered in excavations at Anyang
(Yin Xu) and elsewhere are commonly decapitated and some are
dismembered. None of the archaeological photographs I have seen
show human spines that were split.
   Since gen is contained in the judgment and repeated in each
line text, how it is translated entirely determines the meanings of
the rest of the texts. The sacrifice-related translations of Kunst
and Rutt assume that gen is a homophone substitution for 墾 ken
“cleave.” This conjecture is strongly supported by the line texts
that clearly refer to cutting up a body. Each act of splitting the
body is followed by a prognostication.
   This hexagram follows with more than usual consistency the
bottom-to-top or foot-to-head organization pattern. Hexagram
23 “Flaying,” does not carry out the anatomical correlation with
the same consistency. Given that all the line texts begin with 艮
gen and are arranged in anatomical order, it seems likely that this
chapter was composed as a unit, rather than as an assembly of
diverse fragments.

52.0 This seems to mean that the splitting is not deep enough to get
inside the body. Kunst translates 身 shen body as “womb,” which
is odd. In the past, this word was sometimes used of the interior of
a woman’s body but this English usage does not fit here (52).
   That he does not see his men is similar to 47.3, referring to
not seeing one’s wife. Both are omens. The two phrases of this
judgment do not seem to belong together.

52.2 Here the cutting seems to be part of a sacrifice but something
has gone wrong so that the body is not held up for display, causing
those in attendance to feel ill at ease.

52.3 “Smoking heart” has baffled most exegetes, who speculate
the heart may have been smoked over a fire after removal. It seems
to me that there is a more direct possibility. Because the inside of
the body is hot, when cut open water vapor would be released and
280	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



would be visible in cold air. The phrase then becomes an omen—if
the heart smokes when removed, it indicates calamity.

52.4 That there will be no blame is the usual routine incantation
and here suggests that proper ritual has been followed in dividing
the body.

52.5 This advises that ritual incantations should be precise. That
splitting of the jaw occurs with a phrase about speaking is possibly
significant.

52.6 Dun 敦 here must mean complete—the butchering process is
now finished and is pronounced to be auspicious.

              53. Commentary 漸 Jian
                 Gradual Approach
Jian 漸 means gradual, but in context with the line texts it means
gradual approach. Like the preceding hexagram, this one has
thematic unity, all the line texts beginning with the phrase, “Wild
geese gradually approach … .” Each time the geese approach a
specified place, but not in any specific geographic order. An oddity
in this hexagram is the association of geese returning with images
of sterility in 53.3 and 53.5.

53.0 Like the judgment in the received version, 24.0, this line
refers to women returning. In the Fuyang version it is specifically
servant women or concubines who return. The reference here is
probably also to servants (Shaughnessy 2014: 243; Redmond and
Hon 2014: 115).The judgment does not mention wild geese but is
parallel to the line texts in being about returning, presumably why
it was placed with this hexagram. Gui 歸 could also mean a woman
coming to her new husband’s home, as is the case for the tag of the
next hexagram.

53.1 While migratory geese were often a symbol of autumn
melancholy, since they fly back in the spring they can just as easily
symbolize return. The use of this sort of natural imagery is very
similar to the Shijing. In the Zhouyi, however, they are clearly
auguries as they are followed with a phrase explaining what they
portend. Indeed, the line texts in the hexagram show a much more
consistent organizational pattern than most others: bird flight
direction; divinatory meaning; character of the augury—ominous,
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      283



auspicious, etc. For a more detailed discussion of this imagery see
Rutt (345f.).

53.2 The geese are an omen promising a happy feast and may also
have been its main dish.

53.3 The reference to the pregnant wife who does not give birth
is less straightforward than it appears. That she is pregnant at
all while the husband is away raises the possibility of adultery.
Regarding not giving birth, a miscarriage or a stillborn would be
obvious, at least to the other women in the family unit, though if
early in pregnancy they would probably keep this from the father.
Given that it is impossible to be pregnant indefinitely without
giving birth, the significance of the line is symbolic, one of several
images of sterility. This was a commonly expressed anxiety in early
societies—that harvests would fail and no children be born. The
husband not coming back from war is a similarly negative image—
presumably he was killed.

53.3/53.4 Shaughnessy notes that wild geese can symbolize marital
separation in the Shijing and suggests that this may be their meaning
in these line texts (1983: 239–44). These various interpretations are
alike in referring to separation and barrenness. The final phrase
of 53.3 is one of many bits of military prognostication scattered
through the Zhouyi; here it is another image of sterility, and loss.

53.5 Auspicious is placed as if it is the conclusion of the phrase, but
in context it seems to be negated.

53.6 The final phrase reminds us that animals were thought of
mainly in terms of their usefulness for humans. They were essential
for food, warmth, and ritual.

         54. Commentary 歸妹 Gui Mei
               Marrying Maiden
This is a famous hexagram and one of the most interesting because
it refers to known historical events. It begins on a happy note with
its mention of a wedding. As it proceeds however, as with real
weddings, family relationships complicate matters.
    The tag itself, 歸妹 Gui Mei, is ambiguous. Usually trans-
lated as The Marrying Maiden, it literally means “Returning
Maiden.”According to Shaughnessy (1983: 239–44; 1997: 94–5,
302) and Rutt (347–9), who provide detailed analyses of the
historical references in the texts of this hexagram, “returning”
was a conventional way of referring to a bride, because the groom
would call for her at her family home and return with her. In some
of the line texts, gui seems to refer to marriage, but in others it
clearly means “returning.” To add to the uncertainty, 妹 means
a young woman or maiden, but can also mean “cousin,” so it
is possibly a consanguineous marriage. The latter seems to have
been common among the aristocracy in early China, perhaps to
prevent dilution of family wealth and power. It is now theoreti-
cally prohibited in the People’s Republic of China. Because of
the prevalence of polygamy, the existence of many half-brothers
and half-sisters in a family, and many consanguineous marriages,
family relationships were almost infinitely complex.
    Shaughnessy notes that this is one of five hexagrams alluding
to historically recognizable events and has parallels to events
mentioned in the Shijing (The Book of Songs), roughly contem-
poraneous with the Zhouyi (1982: 240). Rutt provides a detailed
discussion of the historical situation described (347–9). Although
many efforts have been made to connect Zhouyi passages to
actual Western Zhou historical events, few are sufficiently specific
to be entirely convincing. We must ask why were there only a
few such anecdotes, how were they chosen, and why were these
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    287



specific ones placed in a divinatory text? One reason for inclusion
may have to do with ritual impropriety, an obsession in early
and later China. The importance placed on these is indicated
by their making up a large part of the Zuozhuan, supposedly a
commentary on events of the Spring and Autumn Period. The finer
sleeves of the bridesmaid in 54.5 are likely mentioned because they
represent ritual impropriety. To be blunt, we have here snippets
of ancient gossip.
   It is almost certain that there are many more allusions to
historical events that were forgotten or are not recognizable
because the text is a collection of fragments, complete description
of events being rare. Other than suppression of some details for
political reasons, it is not clear why the text seems so abbreviated,
unless to save writing supplies and scribal labor.

54.0 The judgment consists of standard unfavorable prognostics.
As is commonly the case in the Zhouyi, the judgment has no evident
elation to the line texts that follow it. Instead of 征 zheng, meaning
travel, or military expedition, for its tag, Mawangdui has 正 zheng,
meaning upright. This is almost certainly a scribal variation,
given that the characters look similar and are homophones. The
Mawangdui version, translated by Shaughnessy as, “To be upright
is inauspicious,” is more interesting and certainly a common
enough situation in Chinese history, in which those who told the
truth to power might suffer horrible deaths.

54.1 This, taken together with 54.4 and 54.5, is one of the most
commented upon of all Zhouyi texts. It is believed to refer to
the marriage of the cousin of the next to last Shang King Diyi to
King Wen, who was still Di Yi’s vassal at the time. Rutt suggests
that it was a “sororal” marriage, that is: King Wen married Di
Yi’s younger sisters at the same time. That the marriage was
polygamous is clear, but there is some uncertainty as to whether
the marrying maiden is a concubine or is a primary wife with her
sisters or cousins becoming concubines.
   For the complex arguments about the relation of this line to
the historical events to which it is said to refer, see Shaughnessy
(1983: 239–44) and Rutt (347–9). While it is of great interest to
connect Zhouyi texts to historical events, as the centuries went
by fewer readers would have been aware of these connections.
288	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



Wilhelm-Baynes’ translation of these line texts shows no awareness
of its relation to an historical event (Wilhelm-Baynes: 208–12,
663–8).

54.1 and 54.2 That the lame can walk and the blind see is a
trope found elsewhere in literature. It can designate an impossible
situation, or an anomaly—a cosmic transformation in which all
human limitations are removed. In the context of this chapter these
phrases do not have any evident relationship with those lines about
marriage. As divinatory responses however, they can be read as
saying that one can now move ahead as one’s limitations have been
removed—one can now see reality clearly and can move toward a
goal. Alternatively, the anomalies can be a covert way to indicate
that the events are contrary to the way of heaven.
   Rather than meaning totally blind, 眇 miao can mean blind in
one eye. Read this way, the line is a proverb to the effect that even
those with impairments can still function, somewhat akin to, “In
the land of the blind the one-eyed is king.”
   Wilhelm-Baynes interpret this line as:

   the situation of a girl married to a man who has disappointed
   her. Man and wife ought to work together like a pair of eyes.
   Here the girl is left behind in loneliness; the man of her choice
   either has become unfaithful or has died. But she does not lose
   her inner light of loyalty. Though the other eye is gone, she
   maintains her loyalty even in loneliness. (211)

This is an ingenious interpretation but erroneous in several ways.
Most obviously, it is unlikely that the bride has chosen the man.
Second, unlike modern monogamy, marriage in traditional China
meant entering involuntarily into relationships with many relatives
as well as other wives. Her husband might be the least of her
problems. This reading is entirely suitable for present-day divination
as it assumes contemporary patterns of family relationships but not
those of early China.

54.3 In many editions, 嬬 xu meaning secondary wife as in the
Mawangdui text replaces 須 xu meaning “wait” in the received
text. The received version might be a homophone substitution,
especially as it is an easier character to write. In context the line
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                       289



clearly refers to a secondary wife but her exact status is uncertain
(Rutt: 348). A concubine was not a mistress or a prostitute but a
legitimate member of the household. Bitterness and jealousy among
plural wives is legendary.
   A complicated system of terminology for familial relation-
ships existed in traditional China. A standard reference provides
eleven pages of fine print to enumerate all the possible terms for
designating specific degrees of relationship (Instituts Ricci 2003:
405–15).

54.4 The suitable time would have been selected by divination.
Since the bride did not arrive then, another auspicious time had to
be determined for the wedding. This is no different now. (When I
applied for an appointment to receive a marriage licence in Hong
Kong, the auspicious dates were nearly all taken. But in accord
with Chinese custom my fiancée was able to use her connections to
get us a lucky date.)

54.5 Di Yi 帝乙 was the next to the last Shang emperor, while 帝
Di by itself refers to the supreme god. This phrase demonstrates
that Shang material was incorporated into the Zhouyi, despite the
book’s association with the Zhou replacement of the Shang. It is
almost certain that much else in the text was passed along from the
Shang but with only a few exceptions it is impossible to date the
line texts even approximately.

54.5 This is one of the most striking texts in the entire Book of
Changes, in part because it demonstrates that upstaging the bride
is nothing new. The character could refer to the bride’s younger
sister, or her sister-in-law, or a secondary bride. Whichever was
meant, the line suggests that another woman was distracting
attention from the bride. Female competition is particularly acute
in patriarchal societies because a woman’s fate depends entirely on
her ability to attract and manipulate men. The finer sleeves may
also have been an indication of higher social status than the bride.
In early China, all ritual occasions had very detailed rules setting
out what was allowable based on social rank and many other
variables, including the season of the year. Given that the better
dress is singled out for mention, it is plausible that this was a ritual
error, which would have been inauspicious. For a variety of other
290	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



interpretations, see Shaughnessy (1983: 239–44) and Rutt (349).
In a well-known Lunyu passage referring to such sumptuary rules,
Confucius comments unfavorably on an aristocrat having more
musicians at a banquet than appropriate for his rank.
   The reference to the moon, though poetic, is likely astrological.
As so often, the prognostic seems contrary to other phrases in the
same line text. Perhaps this was a routine expression of hope for
good luck, or perhaps the marriage was auspicious despite the
younger woman having better sleeves.

54.6 These are extremely ill omens for a wedding. The basket
empty of fruit that is offered by the woman indicates she is unable
to conceive. The failure of blood to flow from the sacrificial
stabbing operates on two levels. On the human level, it seems to
represent the man’s inability to impregnate the woman. On the
cosmic level, the failure of a sacrifice is potentially disastrous for
society, which depended on the efficacy of the king’s sacrifices—
though his actual military might was obviously a major factor in
maintaining rulership.

       55. Commentary 豐 Feng Fullness
Fullness is the usual translation of this tag. It occurs in 55.2, 55.3,
55.4, and 55.6, always in reference to being fully covered.

55.0 A routine mention of the king making an offering; here there
is reassurance that it is ritually correct.

55.1 It is hard to translate this line into English without a sexual
implication that is not implied in the Chinese. It seems to be just
another omen. The second phrase is of a type that is frequent in
oracle bone inscriptions: in the coming ten-day week there will be
nothing harmful. This is as much an incantation as a prediction.
Going bringing honor probably means that an official has successfully
carried out a mission for the king, or is about to do so.

55.2 The referent of 蔀 bu, translated here as cover, is uncertain. It
shields from the sun, but does not seem to be a hat. It could be a
cover over a cart, though this is not stated directly. A straw pad to
cover the head from the sun seems likely.
   In rural Asia it is not unusual to see people walking along
holding up an umbrella for sun protection.
   The phrase 日中見斗 ri zhong jian du is repeated in 55.3 and
55.4. Several translations imply that the line means being able to
	               TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     293



see stars faintly by blocking the sun with a screen. This is optically
impossible, unless during a total eclipse of the sun, as suggested by
Rutt (349). Although Venus may be faintly visible just after dawn,
neither it nor any other normal celestial object would be visible
at midday. It is either a reference to a mythical celestial event,
or an occurrence during an eclipse. Eclipses were frightening and
memorable events in the ancient world. As an anomaly involving
disruption of the natural order, an eclipse is akin to 53.1, “the lame
can walk” and 53.2, “the blind can see.” In Luke 3:5 (King James
Version) a similar series of anomalies invokes the power of God:

    Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be
    brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the
    rough ways shall be made smooth;

Anomalies are extreme deviations from normal natural processes.
They could be signs that the emperor had lost the mandate of
heaven, and therefore justify revolution. For this reason, anomalies
engendered great anxiety. Indeed, Confucius himself refused to
discuss “strange occurrences” (Lunyu 7.20, in Watson 2007: 50).
    Kunst translates the third phrase of this line text as, “If you go,
you will get the sickness of doubts” (349). This is more elegant
than my rendering, but has a Christian or existentialist tone that
could not have existed in the Western Zhou. Instead I have trans-
lated it as rare advice to liberate captives.
    The character treated as “straw cover,” can also refer to an
“epact” a nineteen-year period when the phases of the moon recur
on the same days of the month (Rutt: 248f.). Like other ancient
cultures, the Chinese developed elaborate ideas connecting human
life to astronomical events, explicated in great detail by Pankenier
(2013), who also compares these to astrological theories in the
ancient Middle East and Greece.

55.3 The final phrase is usually translated as “fractures.” I have
used “breaks” because precise diagnostic terms are anachronistic
for ancient China. The arm could indeed be broken, or simply
sprained or bruised. The Mawangdui version has the homophone
弓 gong, meaning a bow (weapon) (Shaughnessy 1997: 98f.)
Nonetheless, as the right one is specified, it would seem to refer to
the arm. This seems likely to be a fragment of a description of an
294	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



actual event. Less plausibly it might be a proverb to the effect that
if your vision is poor, you might break your arm.

55.4 Yizhu 夷主 could also be calm or mild, foreign, vulgar, level-
headed, wounded or several other things. All we are really told
about the master is that meeting him is auspicious.

55.5 Here too, zhang 章 could have the meaning of the nineteen-year
metonic lunar cycle. This could be part of my postulated hidden
hemerological meanings.

55.6 This provides a vivid image: the house is in good condition,
since the roof is in good condition, yet the house is deserted. It is
a desolate image, but we do not know why the house is deserted.
The family might have been exiled, or become destitute due to the

       56. Commentary 旅 Lu Traveler
The tag was translated by Wilhelm-Baynes as the Wanderer.
Traveler seems to fit better as the references in the texts here
suggest someone with money, with the possible exception of 56.6.
Also a traveler, unlike a wanderer, has a definite destination that he
intends to visit for specific purposes. In ancient China this would
usually have been on government business, but perhaps could also
be visiting family or friends. Sightseeing was a common reason
for travel in later China but we do not know when traveling for
pleasure became usual.
   A wanderer, on the other hand, is someone who is rootless,
without fixed abode. While wandering often has romantic conno-
tations today, this was not the case in pre-modern China. Later
Chinese sources refer to all sorts of wanderers: diviners, shady
Buddhist monks, musicians, story-tellers, itinerant healers, and a
wide variety of fraudsters. Most would be wandering of necessity,
not for pleasure.

56.0 The judgment is favorable for the traveler, though some of the
line texts are not.

56.1 Suo suo 瑣瑣 “tinkling jade” is a single word in Chinese. Jades
hanging from garments were indications of wealth and status. As
now, displaying wealth could attract the unwelcome attention of
bandits.

56.2 A proverb admonishing the traveler to be careful of his
money, equally sound advice for our own time as well. Holding the
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     297



money close to the chest is another ancient Chinese idiom close to
a modern English one.
  Use of boys as servants was common in China and is frequently
depicted in Song Dynasty paintings.

56.3 Fires were common, buildings were usually wood; heat and
light were provided by fire. Literally the phrase says that the
traveler set the fire, but the rest of the text provides no basis for
imputing such carelessness or maliciousness to the traveler, for
whom it is clearly a disaster. A word seems to be missing here,
perhaps 處 chu, which I have translated as “resting place,” in 56.4.
However, for alternate renderings in which the traveler sets the fire,
see Kunst (350f.) and Rutt (279).

56.4 Early bronze coins were often molded in the shape of spades
and knives. The former have been found in later Western Zhou
tombs. That the word occurs following the phrase about being paid
makes reference to coins plausible, if not certain. Use of 我 wo,
the first person pronoun (which does not distinguish “I” from
“we”), is infrequent in the Zhouyi, occurring only eleven times.
The sudden change from third to first person makes this set phrase
seem out of place here. “Heart not pleased” also appears in 52.2.
One wonders if these were the additions of a different editor. As
the work of Walter Ong, Eric Havelock, and others has shown,
set phrases are often inserted in oral material to maintain meter or
otherwise fill a gap, though unrelated in meaning.

56.5 This has been translated in opposite ways—the arrow hitting
its mark and the arrow missing. Given the commendation in the
next line, the former seems more likely. In 40.6 a hawk is shot by
a prince. Hunting was the main enjoyment of the nobility—as in
the feudal West—and killing the game enhanced the ruler’s aura of
potency.

56.6 A bird setting its nest on fire is a peculiar image. Accordingly
I have substituted 棼 fen “to disorder wood or string” from the
Mawangdui version (Shaughnessy 1997: 140f.). For an explanation
based on reading fen as fire see Rutt (351).
   The wailing could be due to loss of the cow, which would be an
economic disaster for a subsistence farmer. References to wailing
298	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



and to alternating laughing and crying recur throughout the
Zhouyi, often about captives about to be sacrificed. It likely desig-
nates extreme emotional distress, here likely over the loss of the
cow in the final phrase. Losses of farm animals are frequent in the
Zhouyi, as they must have been in the life of the time. As elsewhere
in the Zhouyi text, 易 yi in the Zhouyi often refers to a place, not
to the title of the work, which must have been invented later.

       57. Commentary 巽 Xun Kneeling
The meaning of the tag is indeterminate. Wilhelm-Baynes’ trans-
lation is based on the associations of the redoubled trigram,
correlated with wind and gentle. Since they were a much later
innovation, “gentle, penetrating, wind” cannot have been the
original meaning. The Mawangdui manuscript is damaged where
the tag would have been; Shaughnessy believes it was suan “to
calculate”; based on where this appears in the text (1997: 150f.,
317). Bernardo notes that the archaic form of the character has two
kneeling stick figures on the top (2012: 226). This is consistent with
food offering as used by Rutt (351). Kunst is similar. It is important
to note that while kneeling is a universal expression of submission,
it was also a usual way to sit, chairs appearing in China only with
the arrival of Buddhism in the Eastern Han Dynasty (Keightly
1999). Both food offering and kneeling are consistent with the
appearances of the tag character in lines 57.2, 57. 3, and 57. 6.

57.2 The first phrase refers to a ritual during which the participants
kneel before an altar. Gao Heng states that the phrase refers to
smearing with blood. While this unpleasant practice was indeed an
essential part of sacrifice, I do not see any reference to it in this line
or elsewhere in the line texts (Rutt: 351).
   I have translated shi 史 as “record keepers” as this term
referred to a variety of officials responsible for maintaining texts,
which would include those related to ritual and divination. As
early as the Wu Ding oracle bone inscriptions we find the
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     301



Chinese pre-occupation with record keeping, much of which now
seems about ephemera, including divination results. Shaughnessy’s
suggestion of suan “calculations” for the tag would be consistent
with this reference to record keepers (150f., 317).
   Wu 巫 “shamaness” originally referred to a female shaman, or
spirit medium. Dancing was in China as elsewhere a major ritual
and magical activity. As Confucian prudery advanced, shamans
with official status were usually men, though female magical
experts would continue to be consulted. For a recent consideration
of shamanism in early China see Sukhu (2012).

57.5 “Nothing begins but has an end,” is a proverb. See also 38.3.
Geng 庚, is the seventh day of the ten-day week of the Chinese
denary calendar, based on the ten “heavenly stems.” For further
details regarding this method of dating, see hexagram 18. Intervals
or groups of three are extremely common in the Zhouyi, as also in
6.6 and 18.0. Numerical groups have been, and still are, pervasive
in Chinese thought, undoubtedly originating as mnemonics in
pre-literate times. Examples are yin-yang, heaven-earth-humanity,
five tastes, five phases, five (or six) classics, four books, and many
others. Buddhism similarly presents its fundamental doctrines as
numerical lists—the three poisons, four noble truths, eightfold
noble path, etc. Such made it possible in pre-literate times to retain
abstract ideas.

57.6 This line refers back to the traveler’s money that was lost
in the preceding hexagram, 56.4. It is unusual for themes in a
hexagram to continue in another one. Most likely, this phrase was
simply misplaced from the preceding hexagram.

       58. Commentary 兌 Dui Exhange
Like the preceding hexagram, this is made up of a doubled trigram,
which is the source of its name. While there is joy in some lines
of this hexagram, 58.2 and 58.5 are decidedly grim to modern
sensibility and 58.4 is at best ambiguous. Hence “exchange” fits
the contexts better.

58.1 and 58.2 A peace agreement has been reached that includes
the exchange of prisoners.

58.3 The exchange of captives would be a tense process as it brings
the enemies in close proximity to each other.

58.4 Palaver, strictly defined, refers to a prolonged discussion and
negotiation with tribal people in Africa. This seems appropriate for
the clan-based society of the Western Zhou.

58.5 This is a particularly explicit reference to the cruelty inflicted
upon captives, skinning being one of the most agonizing methods
of killing. Why the means of killing is specified here and not
elsewhere is not clear. Without denying the stereotypically fiendish
nature of Chinese tortures, Western ones were equally cruel. It was
only in the eighteenth century that these began to be eliminated.
Sadly, penal reform is at best a work in progress. The guillotine,
invented as a “humane” method of capital punishment, was only
eliminated in 1977.

58.6 In oracle bone inscriptions, 引 yin can refer to a particular
form of sacrifice, but this is not suggested in the context here. Dui 兌
was translated by Wilhelm-Baynes as “seductive joyousness”(226),
based on the hexagram tag, but the early meaning in context is
simply “exchange.”

59.6 Spurting its blood, sets out to get far away.
Nothing blameworthy.
上九渙其血, 去逖出. 无咎.



       59. Commentary 渙 Huan Spurting
There are two fundamentally different ways to construe this tag
character. The usual one has been as scattering, or dispersion.
Given that 59.1 is unambiguously about castrating a stallion, the
tag character has also been taken to mean spurting, referring to the
horse’s blood. I have followed Kunst (59f.) and Rutt (282, 352)
in this. Shaughnessy, however, stays with the meaning of dispersal
(1997: 160f.). In my view, dispersion fits only some of the line
texts, while spurting makes sense in all. Spurting is unpleasantly
vivid in reference to the horse gelding, but our (justified) phobia
about being smeared with body fluids clearly had no precedent in
early China.

59.0 The king and his temple also appear in 45.0.

59.1 “Geld” means to castrate a stallion, less often another large
farm animal. This has been a common farm procedure to the
present day. This meaning for 拯 zheng was suggested by Gao Heng
and accepted by Kunst (356f.) and Rutt (282, 352). Although this
reading is conjectural it fits the contexts and makes this hexagram
one of the most vivid of the entire Changes.

59.2 This seems to refer to the knife or other device used to sever
the scrotum and testicles.

59.3 and 59.4 As I have noted, since it was considered propitious
to be smeared with sacrificial blood, this may have been true with
geldings. Such procedures may well have been ritualized. Although
the Zhouyi text does not state so explicitly, it is also plausible that
the direction of the blood spurting was taken as an omen. The
final phrase probably means that while the stallion was spurting
blood it ran up a hill. The direction of its run may also have been
an omen.
	             TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                    307



59.5. Kunst (1985: 356f.) and Rutt (1996: 282, 352) emend 汗
han “sweat” to 肝 gan “liver,” as it is in the Mawangdui version
(Shaughnessy 160f., 321). Removing the liver, usually of a sheep,
for divination purposes (haruspicy) was pervasive in the ancient
Middle East, Greece and Rome. However, this would have required
killing the animal and thus is entirely inconsistent with castrating
a horse to render him tame. Sweating seems correct—horses
definitely do sweat and most of the line texts of this hexagram are
about equine body fluids.

59.6 Once castrated, the horse would run away, blood still spurting
from the fresh surgical wound, unrestrained by the farmhands
whose main concern at this point would be to avoid being kicked.

310	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



          60. Commentary 節 Jie Time
The early meaning of 節 Jie was a joint in bamboo. This may have
been a metaphor for a segment of time. I translate this character as
“time,” referring not to abstract time as employed in physics, but
as an interval of time.

60.0 A statement, unusual for the Zhouyi, recommending against
divining.
   This hexagram is simply a grouping of prognostications and not
of much interest. It does, however, clearly exemplify the Zhouyi
notion of time as qualitative, that is as auspicious or inauspicious
for specific activities. This is a pre-scientific notion of cause and
effect in which the quality of the time determines, at least partially,
the result. This notion of subjective time still exists in common
locutions such as, “You called at a bad time”; “We had a good
time at the party.”

60.1 and 60.2. This pair of lines is reminiscent of the paired
predictions on oracle bone inscriptions of the sort, “It will rain”;
“It will not rain.” The question is asked both ways, presumably for
greater certainty in interpreting responses. This may be a remnant
of the earliest divination systems, which were binary—giving only
yes or no answers—as persists in coin tossing. These lines are not
necessarily contradictory as only one of them would have been
obtained by the selection procedure.

60.3 This line seems incomplete. The general meaning is “not the
right time, so sighs,” but what it is not the time for and why this
would evoke sighs is not apparent.

60.4, 60.5 and 60.6 are simple divinatory responses.

       61. Commentary 中孚 Zhong Fu
              Captives Within
This tag is yet another reference to captives. Oddly, although the
character 孚 fu appears forty times in the Zhouyi, this is its only
use as a tag. This is consistent with current scholarly opinion that
considers the tags to have a different origin than the judgments and
line texts. This would account for different vocabulary preferences.
This two-character tag phrase seems to specify the location where
the captives are held—inside, or surrounded by troops. Another
possibility is that they were captured from the central position of
the opposing army.
   Wilhelm-Baynes’ translation as “Inner Truth” is appealingly
spiritual but not the early meaning. Here we can see the influence
of Jungian depth psychology.

61.0 There has been much controversy about the meaning of
“suckling pigs and fishes,” but food has always been an auspicious
symbol in China and so this likely refers to a banquet for an
unknown occasion.

61.2 This is one of the best-known passages in the Changes,
presumably because of its pleasant image of parental care (male
as well as female cranes care for their young) and friendship.
It is also the only appearance of 陰 yin in the entire Zhouyi. In
emphasizing that the reference to the crane is gender-neutral,
Pearson reminds us that yin had no gender correlation in the
Zhouyi and that yang 陽 does not appear at all (22f., 223f.). In the
Western Zhou these terms referred to light and shade, with none
of the extensive correlations that developed later. For an excellent
general monograph on yin and yang see R. R. Wang (2012) and for
its place in the Changes, Pearson (2011).
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      313



61.3 This line lists some of the sounds of military activity. The final
phrase is similar to other passages referring to alternating laughing
and wailing, here perhaps the mingled joy of the victors and agony
of the wounded and dying.

61.4 For Chinese notions regarding the effects of the moon on the
human plane, see Pankenier (2014: 491–4).

61.5 This line could mean that since the captives were kept
together, escape is unlikely, thus preventing the blame the guard
would incur if they escaped. While the references to captives seem
obsessive, repetition of this sort is characteristic of material that
was originally orally recited and transmitted.

61.6 “The cock’s cry flies to heaven,” remains a stock phrase
among Chinese, completed by, “while he himself stays on earth.”
Here it is an unfavorable omen. Bird cries in the Shijing are
discussed by Rutt (353f.).

        62. Commentary 小過 Xiao Guo
               Small Mistake
I have translated as Small Mistake to contrast with the tag of
hexagram 28, “Big Mistake,” which uses the same character
過 guo for mistake. Both tags make sense as divinatory responses,
but have no specific content. It can be construed as related to the
judgment text stating that small matters are favored, but not large
ones. Wilhelm’s translation of the tag is based on the diagram in
which weak or yin lines predominate. Others have translated Xiao
Guo as Small Passing, which fits the use of the character in the
line texts. I cannot find any way to put this into English in a way
that makes sense. Here I have deviated from my rule of translating
words identically throughout and have translated guo as “mistake”
in the tag and “passing” in the line texts.

62.0 This is one of the longest judgments. It consists of three of the
four words of the standard invocation, followed by stock phrases.

63.1 Partially repeats references to a fox getting its tail wet.

62.2 This line text embodies the obsession with people meeting
each other that is found throughout the Zhouyi. The first phrase
is about ritual behavior toward ancestors, for which there were
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      317



complex rules, possibly more complex than the rules for treating
one’s living relatives. Kunst translates as meeting the impersonators
of the deceased forebears rather than visiting burial sites (362f.). In
either case, there seems to be the implication that the behavior was
not ritually correct, perhaps because a female relative is favored
over a male one. Errors in treatment of ancestors could anger them,
causing them to bring misfortune upon the living. The second
phrase perhaps suggests that he should have met with his prince
but met with his minister instead. Both phrases are about meeting,
suggesting that virtual meetings with the dead and encounters with
the living were considered alike.

62.3 and 62.4. The meaning here is uncertain. Ostensibly the lines
refer to being in the vicinity of a killer and needing to be careful.

62.5 The Mawangdui manuscript has 茭 jiao meaning “pasture,”
instead of 郊, also jiao, often translated as “suburb.” (Shaughnessy
1997: 92f., 302). I have rendered as “outskirts” because ancient
cities had nothing like our modern, built-up suburbs. The duke
seems to have been hiding in a pit just as duck hunters now conceal
themselves behind a blind.

62.6 It is hard to make any connection between the phrases here.

       63. Commentary 既濟 Ji Ji Across
                the River
The usual way to interpret the word 濟 ji is as a process completed.
I have translated it more literally as crossing or fording a river,
similar to Lynn’s “Ferrying Complete.” This makes it consistent
with the imagery of the Zhouyi, which is always natural, almost
never abstract. Metaphors are straightforward, as with crossing
a wide, possibly turbulent, river in an era of few bridges and no
tunnels.
   The following hexagram, 64, the last in the received order, is
entitled River Not Yet Crossed, forming a complement to 63. In
later cosmological interpretations these two hexagrams were of
particular importance. Surprisingly, of the two, 63 is less auspi-
cious than 64 because it represents stasis. All the lines are in
their “correct” positions—odd numbered positions are occupied
with solid (yang) lines and the even numbered ones with broken
(yin) lines. It might seem good to have all lines are in their proper
positions, but this was taken to mean being stuck in a situation
with no possible movement. In 64, all the lines occupy incorrect
positions, but this is highly dynamic. Yin and yang will move
toward their correct positions, creating the changes that animate
heaven, earth, and humanity. The contrast between activity and
inertia is fundamental, but other metaphysical meanings for the
two figures could just as easily be invented. The hexagrams did not
so much invent ideas as inspire them and provide a framework to
organize them.
   Further evidence that this sort of abstract theorizing was not
present in the original composition is the Mawangdui order in
which hexagrams 63 and 64 are 22 and 54 respectively. Thus the
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                     321



paired position of these two hexagrams was not inherent in the
Zhouyi’s organization. This, of course, need not bother those who
use the Changes for divination, or who find personal meaning in
the yin-yang theory, but it does shed some light on the textual
history.

63.0 “Will begin well but end badly,” is a set phrase and a standard
sort of divinatory advice because it will always come true—no
matter how good things are at a particular moment there will be
problems down the road.

63.1 Dipping the tail, another animal movement omen, presumably
refers to the same fox as mentioned in 64.0. “Not blameworthy” is
the meaning of the omen, not the implication for the animal. In the
received text 輪 lun “wheel” is usually regarded as a homophone
substitution for 綸 lun “cord” or “sash,” the corresponding
character in Mawangdui (Shaughnessy 1997: 80f., 298). Although
neither makes a great deal of sense, having a cord stuck onto a fox’s
tail is more plausible than a wheel. Perhaps it was a tether and the
fox escaped. For detailed discussion of other possibilities see Rutt
(355–7).

63.2 Three thousand years ago losing things would have been
common, as it is today, but may also have been regarded as an
omen. In contrast to our time, in the Zhouyi most lost items seem
to return of their own accord in seven days.

63.3. This is a reference to the defeat of Guifang by Wu Ding,
referred to as the “high ancestor.” Wu Ding (r. 1200–1181 bce)
is one of the best known of the Yin (late Shang) kings because the
earliest oracle bones found near Anyang in 1899 were records of
his divinations. His second wife, Fu Hao, whose intact tomb (sealed
c. 1200 bce) was excavated beginning in 1976, is a particularly
interesting figure, having been a successful general. Whether she
played a role in the defeat of Guifang is not mentioned. She was
buried with 755 jade objects as well as many other burial goods,
showing that the present popularity of luxury goods is nothing
new. It is tempting to conjecture that it was her hair ornament that
was lost in the preceding line, but there is no direct evidence (Rutt:
286, 358).
322	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



63.4 Silk stuffing is quite warm and continues to be used in China
for comforters and winter coats. I have substituted the Mawangdui
variant 冬 dong “winter” for the received version 終 zhong “end”
(Shaughnessy 1997: 80f., 298).

63.5 As I have emphasized throughout, there was great anxiety
that the details of the rituals would not please the ancestors or
spirits because it was universally believed that the well-being of the
king and society were dependent on their propitiation. One of the
pretexts used to justify the Zhou overthrow of the Shang was the
carelessness of the latter regarding the rites. Since the Changes was
associated with the victorious Zhou, it was they who got to decide
which method of sacrifice was the proper one. Rutt suggests that the
Zhou method was to sacrifice humans, rather than animals, based
on lines 45.5 and 46.2 (358). This contradicts the tradition that
human sacrifice ceased with the Zhou conquest, but archaeological
and textual evidence refutes this tradition (Redmond and Hon
2014: 47–9, 133–4). Human sacrifice persisted, but its practice did
gradually wane during the Zhou.

63.6 Wetting the head is either an omen or the mistaken belief,
similar to that of the West, that getting wet or chilled would cause
disease. This belief is the basis of the common term of “cold” for
upper respiratory infections. In many cultures the head is considered
particularly vulnerable, as indicated in the nearly universal wearing
of hats until recently. Because the body loses a substantial amount
of heat through the head, and in the absence of central heating,
the wearing of hats at all times during the cold seasons of the year
would have been important for avoiding hypothermia. Outside
in bitter cold temperatures, wetting the head would have caused
considerable discomfort. The need to keep warm is obvious but it
would have been much harder in the Bronze Age than in our own.

  64. Commentary 未濟 Wei Ji River Not
             Yet Crossed
The incorporation of this hexagram into yin-yang metaphysics
was discussed in the commentary on the previous hexagram.
Several phrases that occur in hexagram 63 are repeated in 64,
consistent with the two of them having been composed as a unit.
This suggests, but does not prove, that the received order was
original and that of Mawangdui a later corruption. A vast number
of schemes have been proposed to “discover” the original order,
ranging from plausible, to eccentric, to bizarre—one hesitates to
add to these numerological fantasies. Finding the “real” sequences
of the hexagrams is at best a diversion, akin to doing a crossword
puzzle, but for some like Shao Yong or Father Joachim Bouvet, S.J.
it became an obsession.

64.0 Here again the image of wetting is specified as happening to
a fox.

64.3 A way to make sense of this seemingly contradictory
prognostication would be that the army is vulnerable before
getting across the river, but safe once on the far side. Tempting as it
is to force separate phrases into coherence, with the Zhouyi, being
too clever can be misleading. Here, I suspect that the compiler
simply put the lines together because both are related to crossing
a river.

64.4 According to Rutt, the second part of the text refers to the
same military victory as 63.3. Zhen might be King Wu Ding, but
	              TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARIES 	                      325



several other possibilities have been suggested including the Duke
of Zhou, to whom the composition of the line texts was later
attributed. However, the predominant current scholarly consensus,
which I share, is that the association of the King Wu, King Wen,
and the Duke of Zhou with the Changes is entirely mythological.
Certainly there is no unambiguous reference to any of these culture
heroes in the Zhouyi texts. Attempts to establish the identity of
the mysterious Zhen or identify other vague historical allusions
are tendentious without adding anything to our understanding of
the classic. However, for a contrary view, see Field (2015) and for
further discussion on the candidates for Zhen, see Rutt (357–9).

64.5 Being of upright character is apparently compatible with
sacrificing captives. The line probably refers to the celebration after
a military victory, highlighted by the blood sacrifice.

64.6 The received text, that of the Shanghai Museum, and the
Fuyang manuscript, all read 有孚 you fu, as elsewhere in the
present translation, “holding captives,” while Mawangdui reads
有復 you fu, “there is a return” (Shaughnessy: 144f., 316). If one
considers the totality of contexts throughout the Zhouyi, fu clearly
means captives. It is possible that it held the meaning of return in
this specific phrase but is more likely a phonetic loan. There are
many such variants but, as here, they do not fundamentally alter
the meaning of the classic.
   That the captives are lost seems inauspicious as the final phrase
of the entire book, but because there is no evidence that the Book
of Changes was conceived as a coherent work, there is no reason
to place special significance on the ultimate line.
   The final phrase, 失是 shi shi, was translated by Kunst (366f.)
and Rutt (360) as losing a spoon. This is based on a presumed
homophone substitution and assumes that losing a spoon would be
an omen. To my mind there have been too many such speculative
emendations in the modern history of Changes. They cannot be
proven wrong but mere homophony does not seem to me sufficient
reason to make up a phrase with no connection to the rest of the
line. However, in terms of the basic understanding of the work, not
much is at stake in these sort of speculations.
   I would have been happy to be able to end my commentaries
with a resounding conclusion, but such would be contrary to the
326	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



very nature of the Zhouyi. To invert one of its recurrent motifs,
the Zhouyi has a beginning but not an end. It began sometime in
the Chinese Bronze Age as a means of coping with uncertainty.
Uncertainty is still with us and so is the Book of Changes, now
in daily use, worldwide, for the same purpose. Its end, if there
will even be one, is nowhere in sight. The book has no end in
another sense—it is an endless loop. Since the hexagram sequence
is arbitrary, one can begin reading it anywhere and stop anywhere.
When used for divination it will tell a new story every time. While
the number of judgment and line texts is finite, the human ingenuity
that interprets them is limitless. As a book of life, it reaches toward
the infinite. It can be read in any order and, most importantly,
can respond to any inquiry we can conceive of. As there is no end
of uncertainty in life, there is no end to the use of the Book of
Changes, indeed human life itself is a Book of Changes.
    A final apology. In my translation and commentaries I have not
done anything to gloss over the numerous unpleasantnesses in the
ancient book. But since its Bronze Age origins, the long interpretive
tradition has made the Book of Changes into a book of reflection
and hope.

The quest for
philosophy in
 the Zhouyi
328
                                 6
     What kind of book is the
        Book of Changes?


In China for thousands of years and in the West for a few centuries,
the Book of Changes has been regarded as a work of utmost
profundity. Its first Western admirers were intellectual luminaries—
a French Jesuit missionary to China, Fr. Joachim Bouvet (d. 1732),
and a German philosopher, Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716), who
was one of the inventors of the calculus.
   Not all agreed that the Book of Changes is profound, or philo-
sophical, or spiritual. With some notable exceptions, Protestant
missionaries saw little value in the Chinese classics, which they
regarded as an impediment to conversion to Christianity. More
serious critiques were advanced by the Doubting Antiquity
Movement, which initiated the reconstruction of the ancient
meanings, the subject of the present work. Succinctly stated, the
conclusion of the Doubting Antiquity Movement was that their
reconstruction of the meanings of the earliest layer of the text, the
Zhouyi, contained no philosophy or moral principles and was filled
with barbaric practices. They pointed out that the philosophical
ideas were much later additions. This analysis is not wrong, but it
is incomplete. That the early text lacked philosophy does not by
itself invalidate the ideas that were attached to it later. These later
philosophical ideas deserve to be assessed on their own merits.
   While the purpose of my translation has been to show the
Western Zhou text without these later accretions, I do not do
this to discredit the text, but rather to show how it began. I see
330	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



two benefits to this approach. First, the Zhouyi is restored as an
historical source for the life of the Western Zhou. It also gives us
an opportunity to observe the not entirely prepossessing beginnings
of Chinese philosophy.
   We can start out from a strong statement of what I take to be a
Christian critique, in the words of Richard Rutt:

   The only aspect of I Ching that can be properly called spiritual is
   communication with spirits, especially ancestral spirits, in order
   to discern future events (51).

This shows the indeterminacy of the concept of “spirituality.”
Without saying so directly, Rutt seems to feel that spirituality needs
a supreme being. This is certainly true of the Religions of the Book,
but it is not true of Buddhism and not true of the Daoist philosophy
of Laozi. Rutt’s perspective was that of a missionary and one
suspects that for him, systems of thought unrelated to the Christian
revelation were ultimately non-spiritual. To his great credit, this
did not interfere with his scholarship on the Zhouyi, which was
meticulous, nor did it prevent him from writing what is perhaps the
best single book in English on the classic. He was a careful scholar,
whose work, for me at least, is indispensable. When he moved from
objective scholarship to judging the spirituality, or lack of it, in
the classic, it would be unreasonable to expect him to set aside his
Christian beliefs. This perspective is as legitimate as any other and
he is open about it. What his view shows is the limitation of judging
a supposedly spiritual text from the perspective of a different
spiritual tradition. To do so makes it difficult to understand why it
was so esteemed by Chinese literati and is now viewed as profound
by those outside the Chinese tradition.
   Rutt adds:

   If the I Ching has, in spite of itself, accrued a quasi-spiritual aura
   and been used for spiritual purposes, that is because its original
   meaning was forgotten. The resulting obscurity made it easy for
   the text to be used for many religions … its fascination lies in
   its availability as a vehicle for its readers’ preoccupations. (51)

I agree with this statement, except spiritual texts are works in
progress and, inevitably, new meanings supplant some of the
	       WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS THE BOOK OF CHANGES?	                   331



older ones. To take an obvious modern example, Jung’s idea of
synchronicity was partly inspired by the I Ching, and is not any less
meaningful because it is not present in the I Ching itself. Books teach
us facts, but they also inspire us. Rutt does acknowledge some of the
ways the Changes has been spiritualized by ways of thought external
to it, particularly the psychology of Carl Jung. He was clearly
ambivalent about the Changes, as I am, though in different ways.
Given its complex history I do not see any way to feel otherwise.
    My approach is dialectical. While I often express my disagree-
ments with Rutt, as I mention at the beginning, it is only through
his work that I came to whatever understanding I have of the
classic. I believe Rutt had essential insights that made him able to
identify critical issues with the Zhouyi that need to be addressed
in any translation and commentary. Hence I have referred to him
often, often agreeing, sometimes disagreeing. Rutt convinced me
that there is little direct expression of spirituality, or wisdom, or
philosophy, in the Western Zhou text. It was this however that
prompted me to search for what is latent in the text that allowed
it to become, at least in the minds of its exegetes, a work of both
wisdom and philosophy.
    While Rutt extensively discusses how the Changes was used
for divination, he seems not to have practiced it himself. Thus he
writes as a scholar, not as a practitioner. I believe this limits insight
into the Changes. It is not that practicing divination will make one
a believer, rather it enriches one’s perspective on it. Like meditation
and many other spiritual practices, divination is a physical and
perceptual act. Whincup sums it up well. (223) When he consulted
the Changes he often received good advice, but he decided it was
better to make one’s decisions oneself.
    In contrast to simply listening to a lecture or reading—whether
from print or screen—practicing divination with the I Ching is
an active process, consisting of both mental and physical activity.
While the mind controls most physical activity, sensation and
movement in turn affect the mind. Traditionally, consulting the I
Ching is done facing north as one would if conferring with a living
sage. Incense is lit as a token offering, a few moments are taken
to still the mind and concentrate the inquiry. Then a hexagram
is selected, ideally with yarrow, alternatively with coins, beads
or other methods. The selected passage is read, and if there are
changing lines perhaps additional text is taken into consideration.
332	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



To conclude the session one thanks the oracle but continues to
contemplate the response.
    In the frenetic modern world these procedures are usually abbre-
viated, but it is still necessary to physically manipulate objects to
select a hexagram, to open the book to the proper page, and to
reflect on how the selected text bears on one’s inquiry. That the
text is selected without conscious choice is vital to the practice and
one factor that distinguishes an I Ching consultation from dipping
into a self-help book.
    The spirituality of the Book of Changes, if there is any, requires
the divination process to be fully experienced. The same can be true
with other sorts of ethical and philosophical ideas. These may come
to be understood as one reflects on their relevance to one’s own
life. Modern education tends to teach solely by lecture, book, and
computer screen. In the past, practices were considered essential
to philosophy. The ideas of Daoism were related to early use of
breathing exercises (Michael 2015: xvi et passim). The central
Buddhist idea of non-attachment is experienced during meditation.
    I am not advocating any particular religious practices, nor
taking a position on whether use of the I Ching benefits one’s life,
though many report benefit from such practices. Rather, my point
is that study of the Changes solely as a text does not replicate its
traditional use. This was true of Western classical philosophy as
well. Pierre Hadot has argued convincingly that for the ancients,
practice was integral to philosophizing:

   All schools denounced the risk taken by philosophers who
   imagine that philosophical discourse can be sufficient to itself
   without being in accord with the philosophical life … they turn
   love of wisdom into love of words. (174)

I am not suggesting that the Book of Changes should not be studied
as a text. After all, it is a book. Textual criticism and reconstruction
are just as important as divination practice. Of the leading
contemporary scholars, some admit to having tried divination with
the Changes, others deny ever having done so. My only point is to
recommend trying the Changes as a practice, not to find fault with
those who do not use it as such.
   Hadot’s work is of great interest in taking us beyond the notion
that practices, such as meditation, are part of Asian spirituality
	       WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS THE BOOK OF CHANGES?	                 333



but are foreign to the West. I am not advocating any specific
practice but want to make readers aware that simply understanding
doctrines is not the same as experiencing them. The claims made
for the spirituality of the Changes presume one also uses it for
self-cultivation. This is true not only of the Changes, but of other
scriptural texts. Put in another way, the spirituality of an inspi-
rational text lies in how it improves the life of the believer or
practitioner. I am not speaking of the Western Zhou use here. We
have no actual evidence of how the Changes was used then, but it
was almost certainly primarily for divination or for bringing good
luck. The notion of self-cultivation is post-axial. While it is perhaps
the central idea of Chinese philosophy (as it was with Socrates in a
different way), we find no direct expression of it so early. However,
many axial religious practices developed from pre-axial ones,
holidays like Easter and Christmas being examples.



From divination to wisdom to philosophy
Some academic philosophers make a distinction between wisdom,
insights on living a good life and coping with life’s difficulties, and
philosophy that goes deeper and analyzes the basic structure of
reality, the nature of knowledge, the basis of right and wrong, the
nature of being, etc. One way wisdom differs from philosophy is
that it usually clarifies problems, while philosophy complicates
them in order to stimulate us to think more deeply, as Socrates
did with his dialogues. Not everyone appreciates being made to
question their beliefs, as Socrates’ tragic fate reminds us. Nor was
he the only philosopher put to death for challenging the status quo.
   There is a tendency to regard wisdom writings as on a lower
level than philosophical ones. I do not take much interest in such
hierarchies, instead expanding T. S. Eliot’s famous dictum, that
“art never improves, only its subject matter changes,” to apply
to philosophy as well. Who would declare Kant or Wittgenstein
greater than Socrates or Aristotle? With literature and philosophy
we see progression toward increasing complexity, but the later
forms do not supplant the earlier ones. The early, seemingly simple,
productions of the human intellect have their own special value
that is not vitiated by later more sophisticated ones.
334	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



    The Zhouyi is a record, though a limited one, of how Bronze
Age humans made life decisions. While we are repelled by many of
their decisions, such as to sacrifice captives, we should recognize
that they were at least thinking about how they should live and
act. If they used an incantation to ward off blame for killing
innocent people, at least they sensed they needed a way to excuse
it. Gradually, too gradually, this led to reductions in such cruel
practices, a change not complete even in the world today.
    So we must accept that at a literal level the Zhouyi is neither
spiritually nor philosophically inspiring. Its interest comes from
being a record of the early efforts of our remote ancestors to
understand the strange cosmos in which we all find ourselves.
The Zhouyi does contain bits of wisdom, as I shall detail below,
but these are not systematic. We do not find general principles for
living, as we do in the Dao De Jing. Unlike the Lunyu, which uses
specific situations to advance general principles, in the Zhouyi
the situations are simple metaphors for practical matters—is this
a good time to see a powerful person, or cross a wide river, for
example. When we do find more general ideas, it is in the form of
proverbs, the earliest form of wisdom writing. The Zhouyi mainly
provides answers to questions, “What do I do now?”
    It is with the addition of the Ten Wings, particularly the
Dazhuan or Great Commentary, that the Changes became an
ethical, spiritual, and philosophical text in China. When this
happened is uncertain. It may have been as early as the Spring
and Autumn Period, or may not have reached final form until
the Western Han Dynasty. Rutt notes correctly that it is the
Ten Wings, particularly the Dazhuan or Great Commentary
that brought philosophy and spirituality to the Changes, but
completely dissociates these from the Western Zhou portion.
Certainly, between the sensibility of the Zhouyi and that of the
Dazhuan there is a wide gulf. However, this begs the question:
why were the ideas recorded in the Dazhuan attached to the
Zhouyi, rather than being left free-standing?
    The Dazhuan contains many references to the Zhouyi, estab-
lishing that the authors of the commentary knew the early text
well. It quotes many phrases from the line texts, including not only
the famous ones such as the cranes calling to their young (61.2)
and the overbearing dragon (1.6) but also rather banal ones, such
as those about using white grass for mats (28.1) and not going
	        WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS THE BOOK OF CHANGES?	               335



out the door (60.1 and 2) (Lynn: 57–9). While some lines were
likely known to some not otherwise familiar with the Changes,
those latter two examples probably would not have been. Thus
the author(s) of the Dazhuan were clearly quite familiar with the
Zhouyi itself, although they added much lore not present in it.
   As another example of the close relation of commentary to text,
the Dazhuan begins where the Changes begins:

    As Heaven is high and noble and Earth is low and humble, so it
    is the Qian and Kun are defined. (Lynn: 47)

To Confucius is attributed an exalted opinion of the Changes:

    The Master [Confucius] said: “The Changes, how perfect it is! It
    was by means of the Changes that the sages exalted their virtues
    and broadened their undertakings. Wisdom made them exalted
    and ritual made them humble.” (Lynn: 56)

That the Changes contained the wisdom of the ancient sages is
clearly stated:

    It is by means of the Book of Changes that the sages plumb the
    utmost profundity and dig into the very incipience (ji) of things.
    (Lynn: 63)

The most famous phrase in the Dazhuan, one that was echoed in
Chinese writings through the ensuing centuries is:

    When in ancient times [Fu Xi] ruled the world … he looked
    upward and observed the images in heaven and looked
    downward and observed the models that the earth provided …
    He thereupon made the eight trigrams in order to … classify the
    myriad things in terms of their true, innate natures. (Lynn: 77)

This is a very expansive claim, that the ancient (mythical) sage-king
observed the nature of heaven and earth and embodied them in the
diagrams of the Book of Changes. While it is the trigrams rather
than the texts that are referred to here, the Zhouyi makes no such
claim for itself. It simply offers itself as a divination manual. Yet,
to reiterate my basic point, while we cannot find a basis for such
336	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



a grandiose conception in the Zhouyi, something about it seemed
to later readers to have philosophical implications, “seeds” as
I have termed them. While my identifications of these seeds are
speculative, the association of the Zhouyi text as a whole with
the development of Chinese philosophy is an undisputed historical
fact. Restraint is necessary here, however, considering how much
fantasy has been read into the Book of Changes.
   I do not claim that those who added philosophy to the Changes
did so entirely based on the Western Zhou text. Many of the ideas
later associated with it, especially the dynamic interaction of yin
and yang, were based almost entirely on the line patterns and had
no precedent in the texts. Instead I suggest that the Zhouyi inspired
philosophy rather than creating it.



         The subjectivity of knowledge
Chinese philosophy sought patterns underlying the constant flux
of the cosmos, but did not consider the world of experience to be
a mere illusion. In a famous Daoist anecdote, Zhuangzi awakens
from dreaming that he is a butterfly and then questions if it was
him, Zhuangzi, dreaming of being a butterfly, or if he is really a
butterfly dreaming it is Zhuangzi. As in his other famous anecdote
regarding whether he can tell when fish are having a good time,
these passages are about the subjectivity of knowledge. They
force us to admit that what we assume is real is uncertain, but in
a humorous rather than nihilistic sense. We all know we are not
butterflies, but not how to prove it. With Confucianism, the nature
of reality is never questioned; the concern of philosophy was the
moral life.
    The this-worldliness of Chinese culture was not absolute. The
dead inhabited their own realm but it was not imagined in much
detail until the arrival of Buddhism. Mind-journeys were part
of philosophical Daoism, and as a religion it had an extremely
elaborate pantheon. Yet the existence of the alternative realities
did not imply that the normal world of these senses was merely an
illusion, as Buddhism sometimes did.
	       WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS THE BOOK OF CHANGES?	                337



      Was pre-modern Chinese thought
             really philosophy?
It remains a debate among some Western philosophers as to whether
Chinese thought can legitimately be termed philosophy. There is a
related controversy as to whether Confucianism can be termed a
religion. I mention these disputes, which I find unproductive, not to
join in them, but simply to point out that the intellectual traditions
of China are quite different from those referred to as philosophy
in the West. The term philosophy in particular carries a value
judgment as implying the highest levels of human thought. Thus
stating that China did not have true philosophy holds the impli-
cation, sometimes explicitly stated, that its intellectual traditions
are inferior to those of the ancient Greco-Roman world.
    Ultimately, these are not questions about philosophy as an
aspect of human thought; they are questions about definitions. As
did philosophy in the West, that of China represented a people’s
attempts to understand existence on a deep level. To be sure,
there was no Chinese Socrates, Aquinas, Kant, Wittgenstein, or
Sartre, anymore than there was a Western Confucius, Mencius,
Laozi, Zhuangzi, Shao Yong, or Zhu Xi. Would we think better
of Chinese philosophy if it were more like what the West assigns
to its own tradition? I would not; the very fact that it is different
broadens our conception of what philosophy can be.
    Chinese philosophy tends to represent abstractions in terms
of concrete analogies. Heaven 天 tian, even though it represents
higher unseen forces affecting human life, is also the sky as seen
both day and night. Use of the visible to represent the abstract does
not mean that the thought is stuck on the realm of the concrete.
In regard to common criticism of analogy as an inferior form
of argument, it can be pointed out that the fundamental idea of
Platonism was the cave analogy in which we can only perceive the
ideal in distorted form.
    My reason for mentioning these issues is simply to forewarn
the reader that what I will present as philosophy may not meet the
expectations of those primarily familiar with the ancient Western
philosophers. It may seem difficult to describe phrases about horses
returning, or a bridesmaid having better sleeves than the bride, or
human sacrifice, as philosophy—and indeed they are not. However,
338	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



if the reader is patient, I will explain the relationship. The value
of this exercise is the opportunity to observe the phase of human
consciousness just when philosophy was about to appear.



           The enchanted world of the
                 Western Zhou
The cosmos of the Zhouyi is enchanted; causality is metaphysical
and magical rather than empirical. According to the ideas of
Friedrich Schiller and Max Weber the enchanted mental world is
radically different from our own. All sorts of phenomena that seem
random to us—meeting other people, bird flights, facial structure,
animal movements—were experienced as messages relevant to a
person’s life. A walk through nature would be filled with omens
that one would ignore at one’s peril. In early Chinese poetry, what
seems merely aesthetic to us often had symbolic or divinatory
significance. Awareness that images often are omens is essential
for understanding the Zhouyi. Descriptions that seem random:
a piglet, an oreole’s call—have meaning. The key to what these
omens portend was lost long ago, yet we can understand why they
were included once we realize that they were there because of their
prognostic significance.
   Most—but not all—early philosophers, including Socrates and
Confucius, believed in divination. Despite their rationality they did
not question the enchantment of the world. Cicero, in contrast,
though an official augur—an interpreter of bird flight omens—
was an early skeptic concerning the efficacy of divination (De
Divinatione). The Chinese philosopher Xunzi was also a skeptic.
As now, knowledge and practice of divination did not necessarily
imply belief. In practice, augury was a source of political power as
the augur could read his political goals into the bird flock patterns.
Diviners in China would similarly interpret omens in ways that
would benefit—or protect—themselves.

        Metaphysical and cosmological
            concepts in the Zhouyi
Qualitative time
“Favorable if having to go someplace,” “Beneficial to meet the
important person,” “Beneficial to ford the great river.” These
rather vague phrases actually tell us much about the mind of the
Western Zhou. As Francois Jullien has expounded at length, a time
has its own quality (1992: 5–16). In the Zhouyi, at a given moment
some kinds of activities will succeed while others will fail or, even
worse, bring blame from those in power. Times are subjective
or psychological. This is also present in modern thought, but is
attributed to a subjective response to factual circumstances, not
to a quality of time itself. Yet we refer frequently to psychological
time in such expressions as, “Have a nice day,” “I’m not in the
mood today,” or, on telephoning someone, “Is this a good time
for you to talk?” Or, as expressed to me by a prominent sinologist,
whom I shall not name, regarding his gambling, “Sometimes you’re
just hot, you know?” Thus for humans, the actual experience of
time is qualitative. Different activities are considered appropriate
for different times of day. We have cereal or eggs for breakfast but
not hot curry. Most Americans think of soup as a lunch or dinner
food, but my wife, who is Chinese, has it for breakfast. The list
could go on. Quantitative time does not replace psychological time;
it supplements it.
    Time intervals in the Zhouyi tend to be indefinite—three days
and seven days mean approximately three or seven days. The
I Ching advises as to whether an act is beneficial or not at the
time of the inquiry, but rarely gives an exact time frame. This is
consistent with time as experienced by agricultural societies which
lived by sunrise and sunset and the changing seasons. Our need to
be conscious of exact time so as to get to work, attend meetings,
or catch planes, is a rather recent development. In using qualitative
time, the Zhouyi contrasts with astrology; astronomical positions
occur at exact times, predictable with sufficient knowledge. Later,
Chinese divination methods became more specific about time.
Examples are bazi, or eight-character divination, which is based
on birth time and date, and Tong Shu, government-sponsored
340	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



almanacs that state favorable days, even for such mundane matters
as baths and haircuts.
   The idea of favorable and unfavorable times is also present in
the Dao De Jing:

   Just as you breathe in and breathe out
   Sometimes you’re ahead and other times behind
   Sometimes you’re strong and other times weak
   Sometimes you’re with people and other times alone. (Star: 42)

Just as breathing is rhythmical, so are other aspects of human
well-being. In this quotation from the Dao De Jing, this is stated
as the inherent pattern of human life. The Zhouyi offers no general
principle like this, but tells the inquirer when things are auspicious
and when they are ominous for a specific activity. Time is quali-
tative and cyclical but the Zhouyi does not state these as general
truths, as does the Dao De Jing. A related theme is action and
withdrawal. The quality of the time determines when it is favorable
to act and when it is better to avoid acting. In abstract terms this
became an aspect part of the yin-yang duality.This alternation is
fundamental to the Chinese conception of human life.
    Contemporary Chinese politics also seems cyclical. The
government sometimes tolerates mild dissent, but at other times
suppresses it harshly. Similarly, its stance toward the United States
alternates between an attitude of warm friendship and verbal
hostility. Such is not unique to China, but perhaps only in China is
it part of a philosophical tradition. It is best viewed not as incon-
sistency but as the alternation of the predominance of two basic
forces.
    Some yin-yang cycles are regular, such as the alternation of day
and night, but others are not entirely predictable. Nonetheless it is
invariable that once yin or yang reaches its peak, it starts to decline
as the other rises. This notion of change is a distinct contrast to
Western philosophy, which usually considers change as something
that progresses irreversibly. Western philosophy has often felt that
change needs to be explained, whereas in Chinese thought, change
is simply the way things are.

                       Yin and Yang
This, the most famous concept associated with the Book of
Changes, and one that has become part of world culture, is not
actually found in the Zhouyi. Yin is mentioned once, in 61.2, where
it refers to the shady south bank of a river and has no metaphysical
implications. Yang does not appear at all.
    Dualism is inherent in mental representations of experience:
yes–no, dark–light, hot–cold, male–female, young–old, living–
dead, and so on. Given this inherent tendency of the human mind
to think in dualities, when the concepts of yin and yang became
metaphysical it was an obvious step to symbolize them with the
broken and solid lines of the Zhouyi. It has been suggested the
two types of lines originally developed from a yes-or-no divination
method akin to tossing a coin. Expanding the lines to sets of six
allowed philosophical and cosmological meanings also to be repre-
sented by them.
    While there was some understanding by the time of the Han
that texts were historical entities, the sagely origin, and hence the
validity, of the Changes was usually taken for granted. That all of
the four elements of each chapter were related to each other was
assumed, consistent with the supposed sagely origin. Thus it is
only beginning in the twentieth century that the components were
dissected from each other and analyzed separately.
    Needham provides a useful summary of the nature of yin and
yang and the correlative cosmology of which they are a part (1956:
273–91). His table of symbolic correlations is also quite useful
(1956: 262f.).
    The Way or Dao 道, which became the most fundamental term
in Chinese metaphysics, appears only four times in the Zhouyi
(9.1, 10.2, 17.4, and 24.0). With the possible exception of 10.2,
which we can imagine is a metaphor, the word simply means path
or road and has no metaphysical significance. A path is a natural
metaphor for life but is extended in Chinese philosophy to refer to
the workings of the cosmos and of the proper ways for humans to
live within it. This concept is prominent in the Dazhuan but not
in the Zhouyi.
342	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



        Junzi and da ren versus xiao ren
The contrast between junzi 君子 or da ren 大人 and xiao ren
小人(upright or important people versus petty or small-minded
ones) is used to suggest moral distinctions in the Zhouyi. The
xiao ren or petty person is morally inferior and so can be
dangerous to the cultivated person and to society as a whole.
Junzi originally referred to a prince and da ren to someone of
high rank. In early times, it was usual to equate social position
with character and virtue. In English the word noble can refer
to a virtuous character or hereditary high social position. This
distinction between people of high or low character is funda-
mental to Chinese ethical thought, though it often sounds
snobbish to Western readers. We find hints of moral distinctions
in the Zhouyi—especially in the recurrent theme of avoiding
blame—but most of the divinatory responses simply recommend
what is auspicious. This has led some scholars, notably Richard
Rutt, to declare the text to be amoral, advising what is in the
inquirer’s best interest rather than what is right. This criticism is
not wrong, but somewhat unfair because we cannot take the lack
of ethical language at this very early stage of human thought to
imply there was no morality.



  Are the hexagram figures philosophy?
As already mentioned, there is no evidence from the Western
Zhou that the hexagram figures played any role in interpretation.
Most scholarly opinion assumes that originally the hexagrams
were simply a means for organizing the material and selecting
the divinatory response. By the time of the Western Han, the
diagrams had become the primary means of interpretation. This
is not surprising as the texts themselves are rather recalcitrant,
yet something had to be done to maintain the utility of the book
that was believed to contain the wisdom of the ancient sages.
Interpretation with diagrams is already present in the Changes
anecdotes in the Zuozhuan. The earliest known conceptual discus-
sions of the trigrams are in the Dazhuan and the Shuogua
(Explaining the Trigrams), the eighth of the Ten Wings.
	       WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS THE BOOK OF CHANGES?	                343



    During the Han Dynasty, interpretation by means of the diagrams
became a distinct school, known as 象數 Xiangshu or Images and
Numbers. In the Song Dynasty this reached further elaboration,
particularly in the speculative philosophy of Shao Yong. (Two of
the many modern examples of how elaborate analysis of hexagram
patterns can become are the works of R. S. Cook and Yang Li.)
    Wang Bi (226–49) reasserted the importance of the texts in what
became known as the 義理 Yili or Meanings and Principles School,
though this still made use of the diagrams.
    Both modes of interpretation are in use today. Most casual
readers focus on the texts, usually in the Wilhelm-Baynes version.
Much of Wilhelm’s explanations are actually based on the diagrams,
though this would not be apparent to the casual reader—who in
any case might not care. Difficult as the texts are, direct interpre-
tation from line patterns is far from self-evident. On the other
hand, anything can be projected onto them. Divination from the
texts must have some relation to them for the sake of credibility.
    Much confusion has been created by the assumption that all four
components are closely related thematically. This is true only for a
few chapters. The exceptions are minor. The hexagrams for Lower
Jaw and Cauldron do resemble the objects they refer to. Hexagram
5 has references to wetness in the texts and contains the trigram
for water. Such relationships are not systematic, however. A few
hexagrams have thematic unity, for example 59 Spurting, about the
castration of a stallion, or the nervous chattering induced by thunder
in 51. On the other hand, why Oreole, the tag of 30, is connected to
fire, the association of the hexagram, or weeping, as in 30.5 is not
apparent. However, when we recognize the texts of hexagram 30 as
a miscellaneous collection they make sense separately.
    Wilhelm-Baynes’ attempt to make sense of the tag and associated
judgment, “What is dark clings to what is bright and so enhances
the brightness of the latter,” makes metaphysical nonsense of a
text that is clear, if banal. It is the attempt to make it profound
that makes it obscure. Now, I will admit that the Wilhelm-Baynes
rendering is more interesting that mine, “Beneficial to divine; make
offering. For breeding cows, auspicious.” Unfortunately, the actual
text has nothing to do with dark paradoxically enhancing bright.
    That the diagrams came to be the basis of much exegesis should
not surprise us. Diagrams have always been a means of repre-
senting the sacred. Certain geometric shapes strike the human
344	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



mind as having meaning. Obvious examples include crosses of
several configurations, constellation patterns, mandalas, or the
circle within a square symbolizing heaven and earth, later the basis
of the luopan or geomantic compass. The most influential modern
writer on symbolism, Carl G. Jung—who was also the most influ-
ential Western interpreter of the I Ching—explained symbols as
elements of what he called the “collective unconscious.” That is
to say, they somehow resonate with built-in mental structures
related to cognitive processing mechanisms. The brain tends to
reduce complex visual phenomena to simpler geometric representa-
tions. Given the sensation of numenousness that many feel when
looking at hexagram arrays, they suggest esoteric meanings and we
can understand why, in a pre-scientific era, they were thought to
represent all the phenomena of nature.
   Modern analytic philosophy would not find any philosophy
in the hexagram figures. Yet they did serve as a systematic way
of representing the situations of human life. Symbolic logic is
quite unlike the hexagrams, yet both are ways of manipulating
symbols to elucidate reality. Needham may have been right when
he said that the very explanatory power of the system inhibited
the development of science in China. However, I would modify
this hypothesis to blame not the ancient system, but the social
conservatism that sought truth by looking back to antiquity rather
than considering other models of reality.



            Sagehood, incipience, and
               human flourishing
As already discussed, time in the Zhouyi is qualitative, with each
time having a particular nature in which some things can be
accomplished while others cannot. Many of the repeated terms
and phrases of the Zhouyi refer to the quality of time: auspicious,
beneficial, without blame, harsh, ominous, to name a few. Chinese
thought analyzes time phenomenologically. While the time of
physics is regular and objective, the human experience of time is
not. Waiting on line feels long, watching an exciting film is short.
   The nature of the sage is to recognize incipience, in effect to
be aware of the quality of a given time and thus act properly in
	       WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS THE BOOK OF CHANGES?	               345



every situation, knowing in advance how it will proceed. Thus
he (the usual gender for sages) would instinctively be in accord
with heaven at each moment. This ability, along with breathing
exercises and herb ingestion, resulted in great longevity, extending
even to centuries, though in historical times there were no more
sages. One of the Eight Immortals was female, but this myth is
relatively late. Regarding any notion of female sagehood, we have
little documentation. Transcendence was implicit in the concept of
the sage, but its effect was to enhance the sage’s ability to enhance
social order. This is expressed in the Lunyu as the Master saying:
“Of those who ruled through inaction, surely Shun was one. What
did he do? Dedicating himself to courtesy, he faced directly south
and that was all” (Lunyu 15.2, in Watson 106).
    Somehow the sage knows just how to set an example to cause
others to assume their proper social role.
    Traditionally the sage either did not need the I Ching, or he
could understand its responses from looking at the hexagrams
alone without the aid of the text. There is an implicit epistemology
here that is recurrent in Chinese philosophy—the highest form of
knowledge is intuitive or innate, as indicated in the famous first
line of the Dao De Jing, “The Dao that can be expressed in words
is not the unchanging Dao.” While the sage either understands
the Zhouyi from the diagrams alone, or does not need it at all,
those who are not sages can avail themselves of the wisdom of
the Changes via the diagrams and the texts that supposedly clarify
them, though in actuality are mostly unrelated. There is an episte-
mological theory here: that some have a special ability to perceive
deep meanings not apparent through the senses alone. It was left
indefinite whether this ability is supernatural or a normal, though
rare, human talent. Sagehood can be regarded as an ideal, perhaps
not fully attainable in actuality, but approachable by self-culti-
vation. Notions of sagehood and personal development have a long
history in China (Keenan). The I Ching has always been closely
associated with the notion of the sage. Though early divination
assumed that answers came from spirits, ancestors, or other super-
natural entities, commentators on the I Ching consultation tended
simply to avoid supernatural references.
    Divination can provide practical advice, but also advises about
esoteric matters. While esotericism is not considered respectable
in academic analytic philosophy, humans have always wanted this
346	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



sort of knowledge, and divination has been a common method of
seeking to attain it. China developed many techniques for assessing
special knowledge and developed a rich trove of literature about
the supernatural (Santangelo). The earliest known example of
communicating with the other world is the oracle bone inscriptions
(earliest c. 14 bce). The I Ching is the only written method that had
literary respectability, although shamanism was praised by Zhu
Xi, the Song Dynasty founder of neo-Confucianism. The episte-
mology of divination, if I can be permitted such a notion, is by its
nature assumed rather than proven. With spirit mediums it was
a particular being who responded. In the case of the I Ching the
source was impersonal. This is in a way a philosophical advance
in that it moves away from personalizing all natural forces and
phenomena.
    The concept referred to here as “incipience” is also philosophi-
cally respectable—it embodies the idea that one must look beyond
what is immediately apparent to make proper decisions, that there
are deeper truths under the surface of phenomena. In Chinese
thought these truths, unlike those of the Platonists, are not of
essences or numena, but about proper ordering of personal and
social life. The very existence of the Book of Changes implies that
hidden factors affecting people’s lives can be understood, even by
the non-sage.
    When a hexagram and line text are selected by a random
method to answer an inquiry, the question arises as to whether
this assumes magical beliefs. The answer is not as obvious as it
might seem. With correlative cosmology, in which all events in
the cosmos are interconnected, divination represents a sort of
sampling of the state of things and is not necessarily magical. It
may assume forms of interactions that science has not discovered,
but conceivably might someday. If, however, it is assumed that
spirits guide the reply, then the supernatural is involved. My point
here is that whether divination somehow works or not, belief in it
can be irrational, but is not inherently so. Divination is not based
on empirical science (though astrology depends upon scientific
knowledge of planet movements) but, like science, it assumes
that the world is knowable and can be figured out by the human
mind. (For a consideration of different ways—both supernatural
and psychological—that divination might work, see Redmond and
Hon: 19–36.) Though seemingly self-evident now, the notion that
	       WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS THE BOOK OF CHANGES?	                347



we can understand the world better by seeking to know things not
immediately available to the senses seems to have been absolutely
essential for the development of civilization. It is the beginning of
religion, philosophy, and science.
    To appreciate the role of the Zhouyi or other divination systems
in ancient life, it is important to be aware of the positive functions
it served. To state the obvious, there were no self-help books and
no psychologists, no physical therapists to help with mobility
problems, no financial advisors—and almost no wealth in the
form of money. In a hierarchical society, asking others for advice
is awkward if they are not of similar status. Though it is far from
being a work of psychology, use of the Zhouyi was one of few
ways to help with decision-making, and so can be considered as a
means of nourishing life. (For a contemporary perspective on the
concept of nourishing life, see Farquhar and Zhang 2012.) Those
who use divination commonly feel helped by it. While divination
can lead to bad decisions, most of us are quite capable of making
bad decisions on our own.



         Change, truth, and happiness
As the title, Book of Changes implies, Chinese metaphysics is
about processes, not fixed essences. In this it differs fundamentally
from Plato, Neo-Platonism and much Western thought that seeks
constancy behind changing appearances. In Chinese thought, there
were deeper truths that might be realized, but no conception of a
split between phenomena and numena, no Kantian notion of the
unknowability of ultimate reality. Nor do we find anything like
the analytical approach of Aristotle with his types of causality. In
contrast to Buddhism and other Indian philosophies, native Chinese
philosophy did not conceive of human existence in a negative way,
comparable to the Buddhist doctrine that life is suffering (dukkha)
because of impermanence (anicca). These concepts did enter China
with Buddhism in the Eastern Han, but they were not present
before that. While change is the nature of things, the Book of
Changes can aid in accommodating it. While pre-Buddhist Chinese
thought does not equate change or impermanence with suffering,
neither does it hold the view of American popular psychology
348	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



that change is always good, as exemplified by the title of a recent
book by Dr. Wayne W. Dyer: Change Your Thoughts—Change
Your Life: Living the Wisdom of the Tao. (Also available as an
unabridged eight CD set). Dr. Dyer tells us that he spent an entire
year studying the Dao De Jing. I have spent more than thirty years,
but when it comes to ancient texts, it seems I am a slow learner.
   Certainly the Chinese did not rate their classics by degree of
optimism or pessimism, yet it is interesting to consider them from
this perspective. The Ten Wings and particularly the Dazhuan are
rather more optimistic than the Zhouyi. The Dazhuan provides a
positive outlook on life, encourages virtue, and tends to skip over
violence, never recommending sacrificing captives, for example.
However, it has nothing like the forced optimism of modern
self-help books. The Chinese attitude toward change is more
realistic and neutral: sometimes your plans will succeed; at other
times they will not. Life is constant change; one copes by learning
to accord with Heaven or the Dao with the aid of the I Ching.



Meaning change as the rise of conscience
The most dramatic of all recent discoveries of the early meanings
of the Zhouyi is that 孚 fu, which was taken to mean “trust” or
“sincerity” in the received meanings, actually meant captives who
were being held for sacrifice. Human sacrifice turns out to have
been a major subject of the Zhouyi. These meanings are distin-
guished orthographically in later Chinese. The person radical,
人 ren, was added to the early character to make it specific for
fu prisoner 俘, while the early form of 孚 fu became specific for
trust or sincerity. The recognition that fu was not a virtue, but
was in fact something quite terrible, made the traditional view of
the Changes as a guide to morality and wisdom no longer tenable.
This, and the other moralistic readings of the Changes that had
inspired readers for so many centuries, turned out to be absent
from the Western Zhou texts entirely.
   Confucius famously remarked, “I no longer dream of the
Duke of Zhou,” meaning that he had somehow lost his sense of
connection with this supposed paragon of virtue. After the work
of the Doubting Antiquity Movement, it would be confusing to
	       WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS THE BOOK OF CHANGES?	                 349



dream of the Duke of Zhou. His role is writing the line texts of the
Zhouyi was shown to be myth, as was King Wu’s authorship of the
judgments. (The roles attributed to the two culture heroes varied.)
Fu Xi was relegated to myth. Even the foundational myth of the
legitimacy of the imperial government—the Zhou conquest of
Shang as a triumph of virtue—was no longer plausible (Redmond
and Hon: 60f.). Despite its clear refutation, the appealing mythic
account is still taught in China and widely believed.
   Many admirers of the Changes have resisted the new under-
standing that resulted from the work of the Doubting Antiquity
Movement; even more simply ignore it. A vocal opponent of
“context criticism” of the Changes is Bradford Hatcher (2009:
I. 16–49 et passim). His criticisms are too detailed for fair
consideration here, but basically he objects to replacing the
received meanings with reconstructed ones, fu being a prominent
example. Hatcher makes a valid point that the extreme polysemy
of the Chinese language makes it often impossible to determine
which meaning was intended. This reminds us that there remain
many uncertainties regarding the early meanings, but it does not
change the fact that these were radically different from the later
Confucianized ones. Fu in particular fits all its contexts as captives,
while there is no evidence for concepts like trust and sincerity
in the Western Zhou. A variety of theories have been advanced
as to how fu came to mean trust, though none are convincing.
This is often the case with changes in meaning in any language.
Paradoxically, the removal—or cover-up—of references to human
sacrifice indicates a rising awareness that this practice was wrong,
a major ethical advance. We would like to know how this radical
change in consciousness occurred—from human sacrifice being
beneficial to society, to its being wrong. Unfortunately, the old
texts are silent on such matters.
   With scriptural texts, there are often multiple interpretive tradi-
tions, and from the point of view of religious history, all have some
validity. That the early meanings were different does not mean the
later ones were wrong, though it takes away ancientness as the
basis of their supposed authority. Critical scholarship should not,
in my opinion, try to negate the inspiration that believers find in
the I Ching (or the Bible, or the Heart or Lotus sutras, or any other
scriptural text). That the inspiration resides as much in tradition as
in literal meanings does not invalidate it. Like many, I sometimes
350	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



find spiritual meaning in the Wilhelm-Baynes I Ching despite (or
because of) its bearing scant resemblance to the Western Zhou
meanings.
   An idea of the wide range of ways of construing the Book of
Changes is apparent from perusing the annotated bibliography of
Hacker, Moore, and Patsco (2002) and the I Ching Handbook by
Hacker (1993) Also of interest in this regard are works in English
by Chinese practitioners, such as those of Wei Tat and Chung
Wu. Perusal of these various works will give a good sense of the
extraordinary range of ideas that have been associated with this
single 3,000-year-old book. Finally, as one continues to study the
Changes, there is no reason to prematurely confine oneself to one
of the many viewpoints about the book.
   To point out what should be common sense, when using the
I Ching for divination or any other sort of practice, prudence is to
be exercised in deciding whether to follow any advice seemingly
provided by the classic. Personally, I find divination fascinating
as an aspect of human consciousness, though as to anything
supernatural in the process I remain agnostic, if only because I
like to leave the door open on mystery. Despite my preference
for the scholarly approach, I think that without the diversity of
points of view, 易學 Yi xue, study of the Changes would be far less
interesting.



Did the Changes inhibit the development
          of science in China?
Joseph Needham regarded the correlative cosmology of tradi-
tional China as a major factor that kept China from developing
systematic science. This British historian of science was preoc-
cupied with the paradox that China had made many technological
and scientific discoveries—ceramic manufacture superior to any in
the West and smallpox vaccination, are two examples—yet did not
develop an empirically-based science. Needham’s theory was that
the yin-yang and wu xing cosmology provided such convenient
explanations for all phenomena that they took away the incentive
to study the cosmos empirically. While this idea is plausible, it is
problematic in assuming that China should have developed science.
	       WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS THE BOOK OF CHANGES?	               351



Furthermore, speculating on why something did not happen in
history is questionable. A further difficulty with Needham’s theory
is that metaphysical theories in the West, such as those of Aristotle
or the four humors, did not ultimately prevent science from devel-
oping in the West. Yet his theory is a useful reminder for our own
time’s nostalgia for enchantment, that metaphysics and the super-
natural, however emotionally satisfying their explanations, do not
lead to useful real-world outcomes.

     Philosophy in the Zhouyi


Between the quite mundane Western Zhou text and the well-
developed philosophy of the Dazhuan we have no intermediate
historical sources. While explicitly philosophical statements are not
found in the Zhouyi, I believe we can identify passages in which
philosophy was latent. These passages hint at reflections about
human life that go beyond the simple concrete imagery, or suggest
some degree of ethical awareness. I do not want to exaggerate
this point. I do not think most of the philosophy later associated
with the Changes was somehow hidden in the Western Zhou text.
Rather, as with yin and yang, I believe much of the later philosophy
arose from multiple sources, of which the Zhouyi was one.
   Confucianism invented its own history but projected it back onto
the ancient classics, not only the Zhouyi but also the Shijing and
Spring and Autumn Annals. Its mythology went mostly unques-
tioned until the Doubting Antiquity Movement. The Confucian
meanings are not self-evident; if one did not already know them
from commentaries, one could not guess what they were. Yet there
must have been some relation between the original classics and
their later orthodox readings.
   In the following, I suggest that some material in the Zhouyi
may have been suggestive of philosophical ideas. I think of these
as seeds, or perhaps even sprouts, struggling to rise up through the
soil of pre-axiality. While I admit to starting out with an idea of
what I hoped to find, I have tried to be self-disciplined in staying
close to the texts, as I have translated them. I cannot claim that
my findings rise to the level of certainty, but I believe they are
suggestive.
354	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



              Cosmology and religion
Heaven and earth: Coming together and
separating
Hexagrams 11 and 12 have been particularly important in
I Ching philosophy. The standard philosophical meanings of these
hexagrams were derived entirely from the two possible arrange-
ments for the trigrams designated as heaven and earth. Heaven
in Chinese philosophy was what established the proper order of
things. In hexagram 11 heaven rises up and earth descends, so the
human level moves to accord with the cosmic level. On the other
hand, in hexagram 12, heaven floats up away from earth, which
sinks down. Thus hexagram 11 is the ideal state of affairs, while
hexagram 12 represented the separation of earth and humanity
from heaven. Thus the two hexagrams were convenient represen-
tations of the two overall states of society: living in accord with
heaven’s way, or contrary to it. This interpretation fits Chinese
cosmology neatly. It is arbitrary, however. The two diagrams could
just as easily be interpreted in the opposite way. In hexagram
12 the trigram positions could be considered normal—heaven is
above earth. By this logic, in hexagram 11, earth above heaven, the
cosmos would be disordered. I am not implying that the traditional
interpretation is wrong, simply that it is not the only meaning that
could be imagined for the figures.
   This contrast between hexagrams 11 and 12 fits with Chinese
socio-political theory. For Confucius the way of heaven was being
followed, or it was not. The Dao was in the world, or it was not.
   Heaven in Chinese philosophy was what established the proper
order of things. If the will of heaven was followed by everyone
from the emperor on down, there would be peace and prosperity.
While the emperor had near-absolute power, ritual errors could
raise suspicion that he was not suited to be ruler—expressed not
in terms of competence, but as losing the mandate of heaven. As
we saw in the Zhouyi, even failure to shoot game could cause his
potency to be questioned. That the king or emperor was in effect
appointed by heaven was a powerful argument for his legitimacy,
but lacked objective basis. Since heaven showed its pleasure
or displeasure by natural phenomena—good harvests indicated
	                  PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                      355



heaven’s satisfaction, anomalies its displeasure, and so on. Since the
ruler had no actual control over such, the mandate of heaven could
often be challenged. In practical terms, the mandate was usually
assumed after military conquest.
    Chinese writings on government constantly express anxiety that
in their own time people were not following the way of heaven.
Impropriety on the human level caused disruption on the cosmic
level.
    The importance of this hexagram pairing is an example of
the great importance Chinese thought places on proper position,
whether in soldiers preparing for battle, guests sitting at a banquet,
direction for travel, and other activities such as sacrifice, even
facing the right direction—north—to consult the I Ching. Likely
one reason for the persistence of the hexagrams is that they
seem almost custom-made to represent a hierarchical society. In
traditional China, hierarchy went beyond social rank; all sorts of
situations had rules for correct ordering. The king’s legitimacy was
in part dependent upon his fidelity to ritual, which required the
correct positioning with respect to heaven.
    We do not find anything like a political theory in the Zhouyi,
except that the diagrams and line texts themselves are hierarchical
and seem to prescribe a rigid social structure. It is not that higher
line positions are necessarily better, but that lines, and therefore
people, should be in their proper position.
    This makes it paradoxical that the Changes, though entirely
orthodox in China, became an icon of the egalitarian Western
counter-culture of the 1960s. Its use, besides being fashionable,
was an act of resistance against the dominant scientific worldview,
though not a very serious one, as its use did not mean giving up the
benefits of technology.
    The sixties was not the only time divination has been used to
serve for protest or resistance. Because divination can carry super-
natural authority, yet be made to serve any agenda, in the hands
of charismatic figures it can be a way to justify disorder and revolt.
    Before we completely disparage the authoritarian governmental
system of pre-modern China, we should mention its usual apolo-
getic—that it held China together for over two millennia, an
enormous country with many different languages and ethnicities.
Control was never complete, as expressed in the proverb “Heaven
is high above and the emperor is far away.” One of the best-known
356	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



lines in Chinese literature is that which opens The Romance of
Three Kingdoms, “The empire once united, must divide; once
divided, must unite.” China has continued to unite, while Europe
became fragmented after the fall of the Roman Empire and remains
so today. This is not to say that the Chinese system of government
is better than Western ones, or that it should serve as a model
for other countries, as has been recently proposed, simply that
it succeeded in maintaining itself. Hard as it is for those of us
fortunate enough to live in a democratic society to sympathize with
autocracy, China did have an effective philosophy of social order
and the Book of Changes played a part in it.



             What jawbones can tell us
Hexagram 27 begins with the enigmatic judgment:

   Divination auspicious according to observation of the jaw.

Following this, we are admonished:

   Leave at home your numinous tortoise.

The words of the judgment make grammatical sense but are
otherwise baffling. When one realizes that they are about divination
based on movements of the mandible, the lower jaw, they become
understandable, even if far-fetched. Divination methods, such as
physiognomy, based on the body, were pervasive in the ancient
world. They could be based on bodily locations, markings such as
moles, sensations, or involuntary movements. Another example is
31.2, “sensation in one’s calf, ominous.”
    Odd as these methods seem, they are based on the as-above-
so-below cosmology, also referred to as macro-microcosmic
equivalence. All parts of the cosmos are conceived to be inter-
connected so that what happens in any part is also present in all
the other parts. The body is a microcosm of the cosmos. In recent
decades it has become fashionable to argue that modern quantum
physics was anticipated in China 3,000 years ago (Capra). Despite
its appeal to many in the West and in China, this idea is not correct.
	                   PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                         357



Chinese cosmology did not lead to any advances in science or
technology, nor is the macro-micro-equivalence verifiable in any
objective way. Physics sees distant interactions in the universe but
not equivalence. To give a simplistic example, watching the jaw
movements of family members or guests cannot tell us anything
about the structure of distant galaxies—or even relatively close
objects like the moon. It may, like other methods of divination,
stimulate our intuition, but it cannot reveal remote events.
   Physiognomy has been popular at times in the West, most
recently as phrenology: reading a person’s character by feeling the
shape of his or her head. This was the invention of Franz Joseph
Gall, in 1796. It is not inherently illogical to hypothesize that the
skull could be shaped by the underlying brain. In fact, the skull’s
size is determined by brain growth, but not its surface shape. The
bumps palpated by the phrenologists bore no actual relationship to
character traits. Phrenology mainly served as a parlor game.
   While phrenology enthusiasts in the nineteenth century should
have known better, in their practice there is something akin to
the scientific attitude in physiognomy—searching for anatomical
correlates of individual differences in brain functioning. This is
like the scientific attitude in searching for relationships amongst
phenomena that led to philosophy, and much later to science. What
was lacking was any sense of empirical validation. Ideas about the
significance of facial features were imagined but never tested.
   Another aspect of divination that anticipates philosophy is
the notion of expertise, that some people know more about a
subject than others because they have studied it intensively and,
presumably, gotten better at it. Diviners are experts of a sort,
though amateurs too can do it. One could argue cynically that the
expertise of diviners lies in bilking their clients, and this is certainly
often the case. Yet there is no reason to doubt that many were—
and are—sincere in their practice. Confucius, for example, was
modest about his divinatory abilities, stating that he was accurate
about two thirds of the time.
   I am not claiming that divination or correlative cosmology led
directly to science, rather that they are examples of people looking
for patterns in phenomena. The clearest example is astrology,
now despised by astronomers but acknowledged to be the origin
of systematic observation of celestial events. This does not negate
Needham’s view that metaphysics seems to explain phenomena and
358	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



thus inhibits more open-minded inquiry. This was certainly true in
medicine. Ancient diagnostic methods, including those of China and
Greece, were essentially divination. This is still true of Chinese tongue
and pulse diagnosis, though fans of Chinese medicine imagine they
somehow reveal disordered physiology. Nonetheless, the most skilled
pulse diagnostician cannot discover what a cardiac echo will quickly
reveal. Pulse analysis did not lead to cardiology. On the other hand,
ancient diagnostic methods were the precursors of physical diagnosis.
   It is important not to go too far in finding philosophical or
scientific thought in the ancient world. Causality in pre-scientific
cultures was conceived quite differently from scientific causality,
and even today supernatural beliefs persist today in many parts of
the world. Fortunately curiosity seems to be hard-wired into our
brains, otherwise culture and civilization could not have come to
be. However, curiosity needed the addition of empiricism to lead
to science.



                     A time of sterility
Line 54.6 is one of the most striking images in the Zhouyi and
illustrates vividly the nature of correlative thought:

   The woman offers a basket; there is no fruit.
   The official cuts a sheep, there is no blood.
   There is nothing beneficial.

The images depict impotence, sterility, and ritual inefficacy. The
implication is that the sterility is somehow the fault of the man
and woman. While expressed in terms that may seem superstitious,
underlying these concrete images is a notion of the universe as
vulnerable to the actions of humanity. Fear that humans will harm
the earth persists today in the ecological movement, particularly its
concern with climate change. The human actions that could disrupt
the cosmic order, which the ancients feared, of course differed
radically from those of modern ecology, yet they embodied a
recognition that the environment is vulnerable to human behavior.
The responses to such omens were ritual rather than ecological.
They did not limit forest clearance—necessary for the spread of
	                  PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                    359



cultivation—nor over-hunting, which was a problem with tortoises
and other species. But there were rules for the maintenance of
harmony between humans and the cosmos with recognition that
violations of them, particularly by the king, could result in harm,
or anomalies such as crop failure, drought, and earthquakes.
Humans have had a sense of their actions harming the earth much
longer than is usually imagined. What was missing until recently
was the scientific knowledge to identify environmental harm and
propose solutions. This represents a seismic shift in consciousness,
long after the axial age, in which technical measures replace ritual
as the means for enhancing human flourishing. The extent to which
technology is good or bad is an issue beyond the scope of this
book. My point is that our concern for the environment is ancient;
while knowledge of effective ways to protect it is recent.



                              Ethics
The changing meanings of the first line of the Zhouyi, 元亨利貞
yuan, heng, li, zhen, can be used to illustrate the development of
Chinese philosophical thought. In the Western Zhou they were
simply an invocation. As I have translated:

    Begin with an offering for beneficial divination.

Later this phrase was read as an itemization of good character
traits. Wilhelm-Baynes translate as:

    THE CREATIVE works sublime success,
    Furthering through perseverance. (4)

Lynn translates as:

    Qian consists of fundamentality [yuan], prevalence [heng],
    fitness [li], and constancy [zhen]. (1994: 129 et passim)

These later meanings, although vague, are about virtue or character
traits and have no evident relation to the ritual incantation of the
Zhouyi, raising once again the question of how the new meanings
360	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



came to be. Given that the book owed its prestige to its connection
with the supposedly virtuous Zhou Dynasty, the first words would
have been assumed to be particularly profound, and hence taken to
refer to human ethical ideals as part of the Confucian program to
make the ancient classics advance their interests. These men (their
ideology included confinement of women to the household) were
of the 士 shi class that justified its claim to fitness for office based
on a knowledge of these very classics, which they in effect rewrote.
Thus the superior suitability for office that the Confucians claimed
for themselves was intertwined with the authority of the classics.
   Chinese ethical thought to the present day has always been situa-
tional. There is no Chinese equivalent of the Ten Commandments.
There were, however, many rules for the minutiae of daily life,
and also awareness that ethical decisions must be made in very
diverse circumstances. Men who were examplars of paradigmatic
virtue, such as the Duke of Zhou or Confucius, were particularly
prominent in ethical thought—the truly virtuous person would
always know the right course in any situation. Chinese ethical
writing expresses high ideals of character, so much so that Leibniz
and other Europeans who knew of China only through translations
of its classics imagined the country to be an ethical utopia. Thus
yuan, heng, li, zhen are meant to inspire virtue, not to explain
specific virtues. As such they were about being virtuous rather than
about virtues. We will see how this functioned in the anecdote of
Lady Mu Jiang, to be discussed below.
   The line texts of Qian have an unusual degree of thematic
consistency. The dragon image appears in all the lines, except 1.3,
but here the upright person is implicitly compared to a dragon. As
one moves upward in reading the lines they show progression in
two ways—higher physical location and progressively later stages
of a process.
   Traditionally this was the most important hexagram, as it repre-
sents pure yang, the creative principle. The early Jesuit missionaries
claimed that the dragon was a reference to the creator God, vainly
hoping that this analogy to Genesis would facilitate conversion of
the Chinese. Wang Bi’s commentary on the supposed references to
creation were quite different from Christian ones:

   The myriad things are provided their beginnings by it, and as
   such, it controls heaven.
	                  PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                       361



Yet continued reading shows that the lines are clearly based on
Chinese mythology:

    When it is the moment for it, ride one of the six dragons to drive
    through the sky. (Lynn: 129)

The six dragons here are, of course, the line texts of this hexagram.
While nothing in the Western Zhou text explains the symbolic
meaning of the dragons, they obviously represent energy and so
naturally became correlated with yang, making Qian, with all
solid lines, maximum yang. The line texts describe this energy
transforming from potential to active when the dragon, first hidden
in the depths, rises higher and higher. While dragons are obviously
phallic, this aspect does not play a significant role in the Zhouyi
or later commentaries. Rather, the shape of a dragon is thought
to have been inspired by lightning and came to be commonly
depicted in stormy skies or turbulent waters. It is important to
recognize that the associations with yang are far more extensive
than just masculinity, as yin associations go beyond femininity. The
Western notion that yang and yin are equal is not entirely correct;
yin has many negative associations, including old age, the criminal
underworld and the realm of the dead.
    Because the texts for Qian are more structured than is the
case for most of the other hexagrams, it has been suggested that
it is a later addition. As I have pointed out with regard to many
proposed emendations of the Changes, the only evidence for this
one is negative. There is no evidence to refute it. Recent research
indicates that the dragons originally represented positions of
constellations, suggesting that the texts were not originally yang
correlations.
    While the diagram and the texts of Qian all fit with yang, with
Kun, the second hexagram and the one associated with yin, there
is little relationship of the tag or diagrams with the texts. It was an
obvious step to correlate it with maximum yin, but the only basis
for this was the hexagram. There are no other obvious yin corre-
lations. Although the judgment text refers to a mare, in context
she is not a symbol of femininity but the choice of an animal for
a blood sacrifice. Significantly, in the Mawangdui silk manuscript
this hexagram is not paired with 1 as 2, but is 33. Thus the
yin-yang associations of these two hexagrams were not inherent in
362	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



the Zhouyi, but once the yin-yang cosmology was applied to the
Zhouyi, Kun would be the necessary choice for yin.
   In conclusion, the simple dualism represented by the solid and
broken lines easily permitted the more philosophical dualism
of yin and yang to be superimposed on them. The trigrams and
hexagrams could serve as visual models of the complex combina-
tions of the two forces that were thought to make up all phenomena.
Without dismissing Needham’s judgment of the adverse effects of
this metaphysics on Chinese intellectual development, it was an
extremely successful system in giving Chinese a way to think about
their universe. Simply put, the yin and yang metaphysics helped
make sense of the world.
   For a more detailed exposition of the moral and cosmological
ideas that developed around the Zhouyi, see my colleague Tze-ke
Hon’s chapters in our Teaching the I Ching (Book of Changes)
(2015: 140–80).



        Was early China monotheistic?
Here is line 42.2:

   Perhaps advantageous—ten cowry shells for a tortoise.
   Cannot overcome or avoid.
   Long-lasting auspicious divination.
   The king uses for an offering to Di (the high god), auspicious.

I will begin by considering the mention of Di 帝, the translation
of which has been highly controversial. In the Shang Dynasty it
referred to a spirit to whom sacrifices were offered. Perhaps the
most accurate translation for early usage is “Great Ancestor.”
Sometimes the term was Shangdi 上帝, or high ancestor/spirit.
During the Zhou, Di 帝 was replaced by tian 天 heaven. This
would not have been a radical change, as the character shang
probably referred to the god being in the sky, where gods tend to
reside. Politics may have been involved as well, since deities had
regional or clan affiliations.
   Other commonly-used English translations were often based on
inaccurate implications of monotheism. The question of whether
	                  PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                       363



Shangdi could be considered to refer to the Christian creator God
was acrimoniously debated by missionaries in China and their
organizations back home. Both Catholics and Protestants wanted
to find some form of monotheism in Chinese belief systems, not
only to aid the conversion of Chinese but also to maintain credi-
bility for their own faith in the Christian revelation as universal.
Other missionaries felt the Chinese religions were entirely heathen
and any comparison to Christianity was impious. They were
correct to the extent that arguments for an early but forgotten
monotheism or creator god in China are entirely unpersuasive.
    Di was never the creator god, nor the proclaimer of a moral code,
analogous to the Ten Commandments. Chinese moral thinking is
not based on a declaration from God propagated by a prophet such
as Moses, Jesus, or Mohammed. The source of moral knowledge
is not a single authority, but mythical sages, culture heroes, or
real-life philosophical writers, such as Confucius. The ancient
Chinese worried about angering spirits, especially their ancestors,
but this was mostly a matter of mourning behavior and sacrifice,
not personal morality. Heaven, however, would react to improper
behavior, particularly by the king or emperor, and particularly
regarding excessive sexual indulgence.
    Study and self-cultivation were the key to moral development in
ancient China. The I Ching had become an important resource for
this purpose as early as the Zuozhuan anecdotes. Whether it was
seen as an ethical guide in the Western Zhou is doubtful, though
it clearly was by the time of the Zuozhuan. The I Ching facilitated
personal morality, not by lists of rules but by stimulating self-exami-
nation, as we find in the anecdote of Lady Mu Jiang. In contrast to
the religions of the book, Chinese classics did not describe specific
law-givers, instead, morality was based on the collective wisdom
of (hypothetical) ancient sages. In practice this situational ethical
system was problematic because right and wrong could be whatever
those in power decided it was. Qing Dynasty legal codes, in listing
various offences, state the final one as, “doing what should not
be done.” Thus anything offending someone in power could be
a crime. My personal conclusion from what I know about early
Chinese ethical and legal thought is that it provides a valuable
way for developing one’s own morality, but does not lend itself to
a government of laws rather than of men or women. Nor does it
provide much provision for protecting the weak from the powerful.
364	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



    Returning to the role of Di or Shangdi, because China had no
law-giver equivalent to Yahweh (Jehovah), this was sometimes
taken to support a prejudice that Chinese had no morality. It is
true that no Chinese deity has attributes comparable to those of
Yahweh. They are more akin to those of Greek mythology in that
they were not primarily paragons or judges of morality but beings
who would interfere with humans and needed to be propitiated.
This could include human sacrifice, as with Iphigenia in the Iliad.
In China moral teaching came to be attributed to philosophers
rather than religious figures. The cult of Mao Zedong and the
Little Red Book suggested by Lin Biao in some ways continued
this tradition of humans becoming sages and definitive sources of
morality, though this comparison is unfair to Confucius, Laozi,
Mengzi, and many others.
    Supernatural beings were everywhere in ancient and later China.
They bred as prolifically as Marquis Kang’s horses (35.0), but did
not resemble the monotheistic God of Western Abrahamic faiths
singly or collectively. There was nothing comparable to the first
commandment; the various gods were usually not jealous of the
others. Some became more than local, such as Guanyin, the Buddhist
Goddess of Compassion. Confucius and Laozi were deified. Another
is the ghost-catcher or demon-queller 鍾馗 Zhong Kui. His mythology
originated in the Tang Dynasty; we have little record of Western
Zhou mythology. According to legend, Zhong Kui came first in the
imperial examinations but because he was deformed he was stripped
of his title, leading him to commit suicide. He ended up in hell, but
because of his righteousness he took on the mission of controlling
the evil denizens of hell. A famous painting shows his marriage
procession of a variety of comical-looking demons. Zhong Kui is
one of many figures who died wrongful deaths and were then deified.
General Guan, a hero of the Romance of Three Kingdoms (San Guo),
is another. The main role such deities play in the Chinese spiritual
imagination is as protectors or bringers of good fortune in the form
of money and children. Catholic saints have similar roles in the folk
beliefs of many Catholics. Zhong Kui was a subject of humorous illus-
trations and mostly employed for scary fun, akin to Halloween or the
Chinese Hungry Ghost Festival. These figures are all supernatural but
do not have any elaborate theology or philosophy attached to them.
    The point I am trying to make here is that Chinese philosophy,
except for that of Buddhism, although overlapping with religion
	                  PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                        365



in ideas and practices, is not much based on deities and spirits.
For most Chinese their relationship to deities is little more than
creating altars at home or place of business and making offerings
of fruit and incense. Daoism and Buddhism were philosophical as
well as practical, but the philosophy was of interest only to a few.



      The non-theism of Confucius and
                the I Ching
The seemingly non-theistic character of Confucianism made it very
attractive to Westerners of the Enlightenment who were dissatisfied
with the theistic and institutional nature of the established religions.
It is true that Confucianism is non-theistic, but its earlier admirers
did not realize that the actual Confucians had a rich variety of
other gods. The I Ching, at least as depicted in the Zuozhuan, and
later, was also non-theistic, though not atheistic, and this no doubt
was a great part of its attractiveness for many of its admirers, from
Leibniz to Wilhelm, to Jung, to sixties counter-culture. This same
non-theism resulted in antagonism, particularly on the part of the
missionaries such as McClatchie, Legge, and Rutt. (Why these men
worked so hard for so many years to accurately translate one of
the world’s most difficult non-Christian classics is a great literary
mystery, so far unsolved.)
    The I Ching did not require any specific religious or supernatural
beliefs on the part of the user, nor was it incompatible with any.
One could believe its practice enhanced one’s personal spirituality
without contradicting one’s other beliefs or values. The exception
would be religions that consider it trafficking with the devil, but
this is more a matter of religious authority than doctrine.
    Given that in the Western Zhou religious beliefs were completely
embedded within the rest of culture, the Zhouyi would not have
been discordant with any other practices. While this ancient society
cannot by any stretch of the imagination be termed secular, relation-
ships with deities were mostly what Ong termed as “bribery.” This
is not spiritual in the contemporary use of the word. As soon as we
have evidence of self-conscious spirituality in China, that is, with
axialization, the I Ching became part of it. There were deities but
they mainly served to meet the human need for myth and ritual.
366	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



The great figures of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism were all
human, and all died natural deaths.
   Rutt’s view, that what became the Book of Changes was not
spiritual in the Western Zhou, is not entirely wrong. Spiritual
meanings were superimposed on it later, though it did not,
however, advocate specific religious dogmas or practices and was
arguably more philosophical than religious.



                Human relationships
Teacher and students
Tag 4, “neophytes,” suggests students or beginners, as does
Wilhelm-Baynes’ translation as “youthful folly.” Rare for the
Zhouyi, the judgment is a first person statement and seems to be
a teacher or other mature person expressing dislike of being asked
the same question repeatedly:

   I do not ask the neophytes; the neophytes ask me.
   The initial yarrow divination informs, but to repeat several
   times is disrespectful.
   When disrespected, it does not inform.
   亨. 匪我求童蒙; 童蒙求我.
   初筮告, 再三瀆. 瀆則不告.

Here we have, 3,000 years ago, a teacher interacting with students.
(The passage was also construed as asking the Changes the same
question repeatedly.) The oracle was to be treated with the respect
due a sage. It would be going too far to claim this as analogous to
the Platonic dialogues, which were written at least three centuries
after the Zhouyi, by which time philosophy had blossomed
in both Greece and China. What we do find is that there was
discussion of ideas as early as the Western Zhou, presumably
between teachers and students. One can imagine that the subject
being taught was the Zhouyi. Any teacher recognizes the tensions
inherent in the student-teacher relationship. Debate is essential for
the development of philosophy. Indeed, early philosophical texts
including the Theravada sutras, the Questions of King Milinda,
	                  PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                      367



the Platonic dialogues, and the Lunyu are records of conversations.
This example is as close as we get to a depiction of discussions in
the Western Zhou. Details of human interactions are not often
described in the Zhouyi.
   Actual divination is usually in the form of a dialogue—a
question is asked, the diviner replies, the inquirer is likely to have
comments or further questions, and the diviner may modify the
prediction in response. Sadly, we have few records of these inter-
actions and those that we have are from centuries later than the
Western Zhou.
   Walter Ong emphasizes that early discussions were agonistic, by
which he means verbally combative:

    Socrates taught by attacking, relentlessly, like a bull …
    Oral modes of storing and retrieving knowledge are formulaic in
    design and tend to be agonistic in operation. (2002: 480)

The formulaic nature of the Zhouyi is apparent throughout, but
this judgment text gives a hint of what was likely the agonistic
nature of serious dialogue. The next line, 4.1, is startling to those
used to current thinking on education:

    If the neophytes speak out loud—it is beneficial to use physical
    punishment. Use scolding to restrain them from shame.

Ong points out that for most of history, when teaching outside of
the home was only for boys, physical punishment was considered
necessary for education, particularly in the teaching of Latin
which, “normally entailed physical punishment, often very severe
…” and he quotes George Orwell, who thought it was impossible
to teach Latin without physical punishment. Ong also notes that
in Renaissance iconography the schoolmaster is often depicted
carrying a bundle of switches (2002: 485). Coincidentally, the
Chinese character for father, 父 fu, is supposedly two crossed belts
as would be used to discipline sons. Thus in these lines we have
a representation of two aspects of education, harsh discussion
and severe discipline, likely similar in Ancient China and Ancient
Greece. Why the harshness and severity were thought necessary, I
have no theory to propose, but will point out that the notion of
“nurturing” students is quite recent.
368	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



                           Affection
The image of the crane calling to its young in 61.2 is one of the
most famous and appealing in the Book of Changes. It is also the
only line in which the character 陰 yin appears. No doubt this
was another bird-call omen, but given the subsequent line about
sharing the goblet, there is an atmosphere of warm conviviality,
something not prominent in the Zhouyi. There is also an ethical
undertone—appreciation of nurturing as a value in human
life. As generally the case in the Zhouyi, this is not expressed
in descriptive prose but through an image from the natural
world. This line somewhat softens the rather harsh attitude of
hexagram 4.1.



                             Ethics
Self-examination with the Zhouyi
The most interesting early example of an exchange between diviner
and inquirer is the anecdote of Lady Mu Jiang in the Zuozhuan,
in which the noblewoman, placed under house arrest for stirring
up political unrest, performs a divination to determine if she will
ever be released. She casts the yarrow sticks and obtains 52 Gen,
changing to 17 Sui. The divination is based on the judgment line of
Sui, which is in my translation:

   17.0 Begin with an offering, beneficial to divine.
   There will be no blame.
   元亨利貞. 无咎.

The diviner, no doubt wanting to please his client, interprets the
opening formula, yuan, heng, li, zhen, as, “goodness … sum of all
excellence … harmony of all that is right …” He goes on to predict,
“Your ladyship will get out soon.”
  The lady replies to the contrary:

   I am a woman involved in disorder … I am not benevolent, so
   yuan does not apply to me. I have not stabilized the dynasty, so
	                  PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                      369



    heng does not apply to me. I have acted against my own good,
    so li does not apply to me. I have descended into intrigue, so
    zhen does not apply to me.

She goes on:

    Sui means no trouble, but only for a person with these four
    virtues. I have none of them … . I shall not get out. (Zuozhuan,
    trans. Rutt: 187f.)

It has been suggested that whoever composed Lady Mu Jiang’s
self-critical statement, it was not the allegedly wicked lady herself.
Certainly the language is far more sophisticated than that of the
Spring and Autumn Annals on which the Zuozhuan is supposedly
a commentary. Let us set aside the question of whether such a
dialogue could actually have taken place during the spring and
autumn period and accept the consensus that it was a retelling
added in the Warring States or Early Han. (The extent to which
speeches recorded in early Chinese classics were transcriptions of
what was actually said is the subject of a well-known sinological
controversy between David Shaberg and Yuri Pines.)
   The Mu Jiang anecdote is very informative on several levels.
First, a woman is an active participant in the divination, casting
the yarrow herself. Second, she clearly has a more profound
understanding of the I Ching than the diviner, presumably male,
indicating that women, at least high-born ones, could be learned
in the classics. Confident of her knowledge, Lady Mu Jiang does
not hesitate to authoritatively challenge the diviner’s reading.
The episode is of interest on a philosophical level as well, as it
is the earliest example we have of the Changes being used for
self-analysis. It does not matter whether the real Lady Mu Jiang
composed this self-criticism, or was aware of her faults, or even
knew the Zhouyi because it shows what was believed about
the Zhouyi. Lady Mu Jiang’s rejection of the diviner’s flattering
reading embodies the Changes ideology that the oracle would not
give accurate answers to those who are dishonest or insincere. She
receives a line that is a list of virtues, yet recognizes that she is
unworthy, confessing that she has none of the virtues and therefore
the positive prognosis does not apply to her, indeed that she does
not deserve to be released from her punishment.
370	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



   This expresses ethical philosophy in a way characteristic of
Chinese thought—as anecdotes about individuals who are examples
of high or low morals. It also contains another important point,
that humans are capable of moral development. Lady Mu Jiang
comes to recognize her failings and that her punishment is the result
of her own actions. Further characteristic of Confucian thought is
that her moral insight is possible because of her study of a classic.
   In his famous Foreword to the Wilhelm-Baynes I Ching, Carl
Jung declared:

   The I Ching insists upon self-knowledge throughout. The
   method by which this is to be achieved is open to every kind
   of misuse, and is therefore not for the frivolous-minded and
   immature; nor is it for intellectualists and rationalists. It is
   appropriate only for thoughtful and reflective people who like
   to think about what they do and what happens to them. (xxxiii)

He then issues a disclaimer that he cannot reconcile use of the
I Ching with scientific rationalism.
    Let us set aside the question of how a psychologist writing
3,000 years after the Zhouyi can have anything to tell us about
it, besides the facile dismissal of “intellectualists and rationalists.”
His warning that the Changes is for “those who like to think
about what they do and what happens to them,” applies not only
to ourselves but to Chinese at least as far back as the Spring and
Autumn Period, and perhaps even to the Western Zhou. Whatever
its limitations—and they are many, not least the later-suppressed
acceptance of human sacrifice—the Changes was and is a way of
looking deeper into reality and thus is at root served as a philo-
sophical work. It can also serve, as it did for Carl Jung, to restore
a bit of enchantment to the modern world.
    Many who use the Book of Changes, or other divination
methods, do not trouble themselves as to whether it is rational,
because they think of it simply as a way to find fresh ways of
thinking about a challenging situation—to “think outside the box,”
to use a contemporary set phrase. These ideas can be about simple
practical matters, or ethical dilemmas, or the nature of the cosmos,
or anything else. Bibliomancy can be performed with many texts,
not simply the I Ching. A common practice in the past was to open
a Bible at random and find a phrase to illuminate one’s situation.
	                  PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                      371



   To return to the simple example I gave previously of an I Ching
reading I did for a young woman who was considering a marriage
that would require her to move to China. The selected line stated,
“Not beneficial to cross the great water.” When I told her this,
she acknowledged that she was actually reluctant to make this
move. I do not know what she finally decided, but I think that the
divinatory response was helpful in encouraging her to examine her
misgivings about this crucial life decision. This is the proper use of
divination—considering what it has to say, rather than automati-
cally following it.



                 Respectful intention
Line 30.1, “Treading unevenly but respectfully, he has no blame,”
seems banal, but contains an important principle of ethical
reasoning. As I have emphasized throughout, ancient Chinese rules
for comportment were elaborate. Violating them was a serious
matter, as it could be seen as disrespecting the ruler, or deviating
from the way of heaven. In this line, we find one of the most
fundamental ethical concepts: intent. The improper gait is excused
because there was no intention to be disrespectful. Obvious as this
may seem to us, it represents an early example of ethical thinking.
Confucius also considered intent. Although he advised, “If it is
contrary to ritual, don’t do it” (Lunyu 12.1, in Watson: 80) he also
said, “When a person comes to you in good faith, give him credit
for the good faith” (Lunyu 7.28, in Watson: 51). While Confucius
felt adherence to ritual was essential both for the individual
and society, he often voiced his disapproval of insincerity and
ostentation:

    Although one may have talents as admirable as those of the
    Duke of Zhou, if he employs them in an arrogant manner …
    whatever other qualities he has are not worth a look! (Lunyu
    8.1, in Watson: 55)

What we would consider mere etiquette, in China was considered
ethical necessity, given the metaphysics in which all events
potentially affected all other events. There was great anxiety that
372	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



improper ritual behavior would result in social disorder, even in
as trivial a matter as using the wrong sauce for a particular dish.
While this extreme formality is out of favor in the modern West,
particularly America, we must not let ourselves forget that proper
behavior towards others is the glue that holds societies together.
   Another line in this hexagram, 30.3, refers to mourning behavior
in eras that were themselves ancient by the time of the Western
Zhou. Drumming on an earthenware jar, or singing, are here
regarded as sincere expressions of mourning, in contrast to the
elaborate and wasteful mortuary practices of the affluent. The very
ancient expressed their grief modestly, with a song. As in much
Chinese philosophical writings, high antiquity was imagined as a
time of simple lives and instinctive morality. Both lines described
situations in which someone might be blamed—walking seemingly
casually, or mourning informally. In both, sincerity averts blame.



                      Averting blame
The frequency of prognostications about blame and regret indicates
that these were matters of great anxiety. In hexagram 32, the line
texts 2 and 3 are about shame or regret. These terms are among
the most frequent in the Zhouyi. Jiu 咎 which I have translated as
“blame” appears ninety-nine times. Hui 悔 “regret” appears thirty-
two times. Lin 吝 “shame” appears twenty times. Most often the
phrases in which these words occur are not direct ethical proposi-
tions, but rather warnings that a specific action will incur blame,
regret or shame—or reassurance that it will not. The frequency of
these words indicates a rigid morality, yet blame can still be averted
by what seem to be magical incantations rather than contrition.
   A frequent Western criticism of Chinese culture, though less
often encountered now, is that China is a shame culture rather
than a guilt culture; that is, morality is based on fear of public
embarrassment rather than an inner sense of right and wrong. The
Zhouyi seems to support this theory by use of the terms noted
above. However, it must be kept in mind that guilt is a mental
state and the Zhouyi rarely has anything to say about mental
states or feelings. The shame theory has been criticized, rightly
in my opinion, on the ground that shame is not an inferior form
	                 PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                     373



of morality but one essential to regulation of social behavior.
All of us avoid behaviors because of the effect they might have on
others’ opinions of us. The shame theory ignores the obvious fact
that feeling shame does not preclude feeling guilt. In Christianity,
guilt is encouraged because salvation requires recognition of one’s
own sinfulness. In traditional China, a sense of almost unlimited
obligation to both living and dead was the most fundamental moral
principle. Guilt was most common regarding failure to adequately
fulfill filial obligations. Feeling guilty, commonly for not doing
enough for one’s parents, also made one feel virtuous. People can
be shamed when what they did was not morally wrong. This has
become common on the Internet, but throughout history has been
a powerful means of social control. This is especially in the small
communities of rural China, where all behavior is visible to the
entire community. People can feel unnecessary guilt as well. The
notion that Chinese felt shame but not guilt is simply prejudicial.


                  Caught in the rain
The upright person very determinedly walks alone, though caught
in the rain.

    If drenched has irritation, but nothing blameworthy.
    九三 壯于頄 -- 有凶. 君子夬夬獨行, 遇雨. 若濡,有慍无咎.

This statement, 43.3, is about character. While irritation at such
things as being caught in the rain is natural, the person of good
character does not express frustration. Self-control is fundamental
to the Confucian outlook; it is part of learning to be fully humane.
The Zhouyi phrase also contains subtle encouragement—if you do
not get too upset when soaked in the rain, then you are a better
person. This is an important aspect of moral instruction—for most
people, feeling one is a good person is psychologically rewarding.
Many statements in Chinese ethical philosophy, such as those
about how the junzi acts, have the subtext saying that the reader
can be a junzi if he follows the principle advocated. Unfortunately,
this can lend itself to helping treacherous people pretend to be
good.
374	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



       Observing our lives: Going forward
                and retreating
The line texts of hexagram 20 all refer to looking over one’s
surroundings, but end with different prognoses. The prognoses are
unusually consistent for the Zhouyi, and all are favorable except
for the second phrase of 20.1. Careful observing is a beneficial
activity. This notion of observing life has been a consistent one
in Chinese thought, culminating in the Song philosopher Zhu
Xi’s idea of dao xue, or study of the dao. Observation in Chinese
philosophy was a somewhat different concept from that of natural
science. It was not only objective observation of what the senses
revealed, but also reflection on it. For working out the significance
of what was observed, the I Ching was a valuable aid.
   Both Confucian and Daoist philosophy emphasized self-
knowledge, but in Confucianism this was about one’s own
righteousness and how one could properly fulfill social obliga-
tions. In Daoism, self-knowledge was more about one’s own
mind. Withdrawal from society and imaginary mind journeys were
recommended by Laozi and Zhuangzi. With Buddhism, particularly
Chan Buddhism, one was to question everything one experienced.
   The Zhouyi does not express such sophisticated forms of
inquiry. But it does express the importance of observing and inter-
preting one’s surroundings. Line 20.3, “Observing our lives going
forward and retreating,” is particularly interesting as it suggests a
deeper reflection on human life than simply asking whether to act
or not. Furthermore, the nature of the Zhouyi itself implies a deeper
reality that can be accessed through use of the book for divination.
   Also of interest, 20.2 refers to women as participants in the
divinatory process. There are relatively few references to women
but none express the misogyny later attached to the Changes,
notably by Wang Bi. I have discussed references to women in the
Zhouyi in more detail elsewhere (Redmond and Hon: 72–92).
   In later use, reflection stimulated by the I Ching could range far
from the texts. In his work on Chinese hermeneutics, Ming Dong
Gu comments:

   In Chinese history there have been a few scholars who have
   intuitively appreciated the open nature of the book.
	                  PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                     375



Gu goes on to quote the Song philosopher Cheng Yi (1033–1107):

    If one sticks to one thing, then the three hundred eighty-four
    lines would only represent three hundred eighty-four things.
    That would be the end of it all.
    […]
    When one uses it in observing people and conducting affairs, he
    will find it fitting for everything. (Gu: 101)

While the Zhouyi does not define itself expansively, in its own way,
particularly in hexagram 20, it suggests the value of examining
phenomena, even including bird calls, which somehow led to
speculative thought such as that of Cheng Yi just quoted.



                        Government
An imperial divination
Kidder Smith retells an episode regarding the Kangxi emperor
康熙帝 (1654–1722) (Smith: 14). Having fasted to end a drought,
he had the I Ching cast for him, obtaining hexagram 43. He
interpreted the tag character (which I have translated as “deter-
mination” but which can also mean “cut off”) as prognosticating
that the drought, “… would end only after some of the great had
been humbled …” There is no explicit textual basis for this reading.
However the hexagram, with its solitary broken line in the top
place, could be interpreted as meaning weakness at high level,
or that the weak are over-reaching. The emperor then removed
officials of a rival faction, all “members of Grand Secretary
Mingju’s clique.”
   Smith states that here the I Ching was used to provide, “… super-
human sanction for politically difficult acts” (12). We have no such
detailed description of political use of the Changes in the Western
Zhou, though there are some in the Zuozhuan, for example in
excluding a possible successor to the throne (Rutt: 193f.). Doubtless
the supernatural authority of the Changes was used on many other
occasions to justify pre-existing agendas. Control of omen interpre-
tation was a powerful means of maintaining and exercising power.
376	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



    I have known something like this to happen on a personal level.
I was trying to convince a colleague to present a paper at a session
with me. He consulted the Wilhelm-Baynes I Ching and obtained
hexagram 64, Before Completion. I took this to mean he had
something to complete, namely the paper for presentation; he read
it as meaning he was not ready to present the paper.
    I give these two examples to show how the Changes can provide
excuses for doing what one wanted to do—or not do—anyway. I
have no reason to doubt that what might be called manipulation by
I Ching was widely used even in the Western Zhou.



               Marxism in the Zhouyi?
Line 35.3, Zhong yun 眾允, could be translated as “masses
approve,” to give it a Marxist flavor. Marxist readings of ancient
texts were prevalent in Mao’s China, at least in those intervals
when it was permissible to read the classics at all. Accordingly,
I see no reason to add anything further to this anachronistic
exegetic mode. (For discussion of the Book of Changes under
Mao, see Redmond and Hon: 185–91.) Rather than imagining
that the Zhouyi anticipated Marx, I regard this line as indicating
some concern in the Western Zhou of the overall welfare of the
common people, something not prominent in the Zhouyi. By the
time of Confucius and Laozi, however, there are many references
to the responsibility of rulers to benefit the people. This brief text
of the Western Zhou suggests that the welfare of the masses was
considered then, though it had not yet developed into a philosophy
of government.



Conclusion: The river crossed, or not yet?
Hexagrams 63 and 64 came to be considered among the most
philosophical by Chinese and Western practitioners alike, because
within the yin-yang system they represent archetypal situations of
stagnation and dynamic change respectively. As usual, the Zhouyi
expresses this contrast in concrete terms rather than abstract ones.
Potential energy becoming active is described with the dragon
	                  PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                        377



imagery of hexagram 1, Qian. Hexagram 48.0 describes a situation
of stasis by reference to an everyday activity, “There is no loss;
there is no gain. Coming and going, to and from the well.” Many
other phrases refer to the natural alteration of activity and inactivity
that are inherent in human life—day/night, sleep/wake, work/rest,
happy/sad, hungry/full, arousal/release, and so on. The dark-light
cycle, the most fundamental of all, is less prominent in modern life,
yet change, cyclical and otherwise, remains fundamental.
   Yin and yang provide imagery for change, but do not actually
explain it. Yet such should not be simply dismissed as the
metaphysics of a pre-scientific culture, because imagery and
metaphor are fundamental ways the mind functions. I could say
I have worked like a dog to complete this book, a simile—though
an inaccurate one as all the dogs I have owned have been lazy.
To remove the simile I could say I have worked hard, but “hard”
is also a metaphor based on sensory qualities of objects. I give
these examples to point out that yin and yang are not always
metaphysical, but often simply convenient ways to describe the
processes that govern our lives.
   Hexagrams 63 and 64 stand out because they are inverses of
each other in two ways. First, they are the two possible ways of
having broken and solid alternate. Second, they have rotational
symmetry—when rotated top to bottom each turns into the other.
This made them natural for representing the basic principle that
yin and yang transform into each other. The properties of the
diagram seem to confirm the metaphysics they represent. Such
numerological or geometric traits fascinate a certain cognitive
temperament—not mine I must admit. For those of us who do not
see a profound secret in such patterns, they are still of interest in
their use as philosophical symbols.
   The tags of these two hexagrams, in my translation, Already
Across the River and River Not Yet Crossed indicate completion
and non-completion and so do correlate with the later-added
metaphysical meanings. Wilhelm-Baynes’ Before Completion and
After Completion are more concise but take away the concrete
imagery characteristic of the Western Zhou text. Both contain
references to a fox crossing a river, so this concrete image could be
the origin of the tags.
   The tags of these two adjacent hexagrams are consistent with
my theory that the Chinese pre-occupation with cyclical change
378	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



is implicit in the Zhouyi, even though it had not yet developed
into the more abstract yin-yang doctrine. I suspect that most of
the philosophical additions to the Zhouyi were opportunistic—
later editors searched for elements to which their metaphysical
ideas could be attached. Plausibly, lines in the Zhouyi inspired
metaphysical ideas as well.
   On the one hand, the Zhouyi offers no abstract formulation of
stasis alternating with change, on the other, this recurring cycle
is implicit throughout the entire work. Thus the Zhouyi dealt
with the most fundamental characteristic of existence, though not
expressing this in philosophical language. The numinous-appearing
hexagrams, able to transform into each other by multiple pathways,
seemed to embody the mysterious nature of change. The various
phrases associated with them were about specific changes: what
would happen, whether it was beneficial or ominous, whether
you would be blamed for it, what to do about it. Thus the omens,
proverbs, set phrases, prognostications, emotionally intense events,
and events depicted, were the concrete manifestations of the hidden
forces—yin and yang—revealed by the hexagrams. We do not know
what those who added the metaphysics to the Zhouyi thought of
what they were doing, but this is clearly the underlying principle.
   While I have emphasized the interpretation of 63 as stasis and
64 as activity, a slightly different view was entertained by some
traditional I Ching scholars. As Wilhelm explained hexagram 63:
   For it is just when perfect equilibrium has been reached that any
movement may cause order to revert to disorder (244).
   Regarding 64, he wrote:

   This hexagram indicates a time when the transition from
   disorder to order is not yet completed. The conditions are
   difficult. The task is great and full of responsibility. It is nothing
   less than that of leading the world out of confusion back to
   order. (248f.)

This is perhaps meant as an echo of the already quoted famous first
line of the Romance of Three Kingdoms (San Guo):

   The empire, once divided must unite; once united must divide.

Despite the slightly different interpretation of the two final
	                 PHILOSOPHY IN THE ZHOUYI	                      379



hexagrams, Wilhelm’s reading is still about stasis and change,
order and disorder.



           Some final thoughts on the
             philosophy of change
Heraclitus proclaimed that one can never step in the same river
twice, thus introducing the paradox of constancy and change.
Plato’s cave myth attempts to explain the paradox of constancy
and change, a preoccupation of the Greeks, but not the Chinese.
Confucius famously referred to a river endlessly flowing, but did
not ask himself whether it was still the same river.
   Chinese thought did not consider change as good or bad in
itself, but instead focused their attention on understanding it. The
I Ching does not explain change, but reveals underlying patterns
to help us prepare for it and accommodate to it. The cosmology of
yin-yang and five phases do not explain change but offer a refined
metaphysical description of it, one that is subjective rather than
scientific.
   River Not Yet Crossed is a fitting phrase with which to conclude
this chapter. How the Book of Changes is read will continue to
change, as it has for 3,000 years. With respect to scholarship on
the classic, despite thousands of studies, there remain rivers not
yet crossed. For me one of the most intriguing of the remaining
mysteries is how the Zhouyi became the I Ching and also,
even more basic, how the Zhouyi came to be in the first place. In
this book I have proposed my own hypothesis, but much remains
uncertain.
   A lacuna in I Ching scholarship has been the tendency to focus
either on the received, that is, Confucianized meanings, that were
dominant from the Zuozhuan onward, or on the reconstructed
Western Zhou meanings. Few scholars have worked on both. It is
as if they are different works. Yet without the Zhouyi there would
have been no Ten Wings, no Wang Bi commentaries, and no Zhu
Xi or Shao Yong commentaries either. And no Wilhelm-Baynes
translation and no Carl Jung “Foreword.” Somehow, the Western
Zhou text that now seems so peculiar grew into the classic that
inspired China’s greatest thinkers and is now a world classic. I have
380	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



offered some speculations on how this came to be, but these are at
best a beginning.
    Moving in the opposite direction, we need to try to better under-
stand how the Zhouyi came to be put together in the first place.
There has been extensive scholarship in the West on the nature of
orally transmitted material and the traces it leaves in early writings.
While this has been somewhat neglected by sinologists, I believe it
can shed considerable light on the composition of the Zhouyi.
    There is still more to be done on the excavated manuscripts and
the anecdotes in the Zuozhuan. This should be facilitated by both
now being published in accurate bilingual editions by renowned
scholars (Shaughnessy 2014; Durrant et al. 2016).
    Finally, I believe we need better accounts of what has made the
Changes so spiritually inspiring for so long. Spirituality has long
been suspect in the academy because of its subjective nature and
its association with popular culture. Yet this is what most readers
seek in classics. Jung’s “Foreword” is a start. It explains some of
the spiritual quality that has kept the work alive. Considering
spiritual use does not mean ignoring or rejecting critical schol-
arship. Philology is a necessary beginning that opens doors to
deeper secrets.

              Reading by topic


Reading the Changes as a conventional book, as most readers try
to do, is bound to lead to frustration because it was never intended
to be read as a narrative. Rather, it is a reference book, and was
once even described by an early Western scholar as a dictionary.
Its function was to find the correct divination result after selecting
a hexagram by yarrow or other means.
   A better way to get started reading the Changes is to pick a
topic of interest and read related hexagrams, not necessarily in the
received order. Here I provide a reading list of hexagrams organized
by subject. In most cases, not all the lines in the hexagram are
related to the topic listed here.
   There are some duplications, because many hexagrams refer to
multiple subjects. For a first time reading I suggest starting with
my first category of interesting and important hexagrams. This
will give a better sense of the work than reading in the standard
order.
   This is intended to help the reader get started. It is not meant as
a concordance and does not list all references to the subjects listed.
Some hexagrams are listed under more than one subject.

  How to consult the I Ching


As I have pointed out throughout this work, the Book of Changes
was not a book to be read as we would read non-fiction, but
most closely resembles a reference book, in effect a dictionary
of divinatory responses. It is not alphabetical like a Western
dictionary, but Chinese dictionaries cannot be alphabetical
anyway. With divination, what is needed is a method of selecting
the “correct” response. This means it is selected in a way the
inquirer believes is credible. From the point of view of an agnostic
or non-believer, it does not matter what response is selected, given
that selection methods are generally random. One can browse the
I Ching to find a passage that seems to apply to one’s situation,
but this does not replicate the experience of divination as practiced
in the past. Nor is it as likely to provide a new perspective on one’s
concerns.
   I suspect many people are reluctant to try divination because
they fear giving way to superstition. Also, though they may not
admit it, many are afraid of getting an unhappy prognostication.
These fears are needless; divination by oneself is not addicting
nor need it be taken so seriously as to create anxiety. Very few
responses are inherently bad—there is usually a way to read them
in a positive way. This is particularly important when doing a
reading for someone else. When I do readings to demonstrate how
the I Ching works, I always warn inquirers that they should not
take the process too seriously, just as I do not. With this caution
in mind, I suggest asking a serious question and pondering the
response to see if it contains anything useful. This process need
386	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



not be very time consuming. The I Ching gives concise responses,
generally about the immediate situation. This contrasts with
astrology, for example, which can provide detailed character
analysis and long-term predictions. With the Changes, if one is
unhappy with a response, one can always cast another hexagram;
this is consistent with its underlying view of constant change. In
contrast, with astrology one cannot pick another birth date. This
makes I Ching divination inherently dynamic. This dynamism is
part of the general optimism of Chinese culture, because change
provides hope.
   With any divination method, common sense always has priority,
although in the past this was often not the case. If one uses the
ancient Zhouyi for divination, of which more shortly, its recom-
mendations about human sacrifice are obviously to be ignored, or
taken metaphorically as a suggestion to make an offering, but a
benign one. While I have emphasized the value of restoring the early
meanings as a way of understanding ancient life, it also should be
borne in mind that the Confucians replaced the unpleasant aspects
of the Zhouyi with moralistic readings more than 2,000 years ago.
   It is possible to quickly select a hexagram or line text and
quickly read the response, all in less than ten minutes. However,
the traditional method is more elaborate and meditative and this
is what I suggest for experimentation. Traditionally there are four
steps:



                Proper frame of mind
As the book is conceived as a sage, the inquirer should sit at a table
facing north, the traditional position of respect toward someone
older, wiser, or more powerful. The I Ching and associated items
such as coins or beads should be placed on the otherwise empty
tabletop. One sits quietly and meditates briefly to induce a calm,
open state of mind. In traditional China, consulting the I Ching
was a devotional act, expressing profound respect for the sages
and culture heroes of the past who created Chinese culture.
Alternatively one can reflect on the Dao, the impersonal principle
of cosmic order that sustains us all. I Ching consultation should be
a spiritually affirmative act. In Chinese tradition the ritual included
	                HOW TO CONSULT THE I CHING	                       387



lighting incense. Alternatives would be placing a single fresh
flower on the table to foster a feeling of harmony, or a personally
meaningful object, such as a family picture.



             Formulating the question
Chinese divinatory inquiries were generally in the form of, “What
if I do such and such?” This might be paired with, “What if I do
not do such and such?” To give an example, one would not ask,
“Should I marry so-and-so?” but, “What will it be like if I marry
so-and-so?” If appropriate, one asks the corollary question, “What
if I do not marry so-and-so?” This dual mode of inquiry was in
use more than 3,000 years ago as recorded on the King WuDing
oracle bones. Sometimes a more general form was used, as with
the Lady Mu Jiang anecdote, “What will happen regarding such
and such situation?” My own practice is to ask the inquirer what
area of life he or she is concerned about; there are less of these than
one might think—romance, career, money, health. (The I Ching is
no longer relied upon to predict rain or harvests.) In the imperial
Chinese examination system, success was the number one question,
for oneself or one’s sons.
    The reason that direct questions such as, “Should I marry
so-and-so?” are not very productive is that the I Ching does not
make decisions; these are up to the inquirer. Many report that
Changes consultations have helped them identify implications of
a decision, but did not tell them what to do. Lest I sound overly
credulous about the I Ching, I would point out that this is exactly
what a responsible therapist or other advisor would do. Although
any sort of question can be asked, provided that it is asked
sincerely; traditionally the Changes will respond to frivolous or
repeated questions with a rebuke, as in 4.0. Also, traditionally,
those who are corrupt, like Lady Mu Jiang, will not receive valid
advice. This belief can be explained as maintaining the reputation
of the Changes as morally infallible by allowing good prognoses
for the undeserving or wicked to be set aside.
388	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



          Hexagram and text selection
There are a great variety of methods for selecting the hexagram and
specific line text. There are websites that will pick the text for you
using a random number generator. To my mind, by taking away
the human interaction, this method is pointless. Needless to say, it
does not in any way replicate the experience of traditional Chinese
use. The reflective state of mind is at least as important as the
actual text selected. The various methods generate six lines, which
in turn make up the hexagram. Each line will be broken (yin) or
solid (yang), and fixed or moving. The moving line changes into its
opposite, generating an additional hexagram. The most common
principle is that if there are no moving lines, the judgment text
is the divination response. If there is one moving line, that is the
response to the inquiry. When there is more than one moving line
then the new hexagram is the response, either the judgment text or
the line texts that have changed.
    I have provided a more detailed discussion of I Ching divination
elsewhere (Redmond and Hon: 255–63). The clearest description
of yarrow sorting is Whincup (216–31). Other useful discussions
are those of Hacker (1993: 133–50) and Huang (175–8). Wilhelm-
Baynes’ explanation is overly concise and not very useful (721–4).
    The ancient method of choosing a hexagram used a complex
sorting procedure with fifty yarrow stalks. These sticks are available
on line but the method is rather tedious for hurried modern
lifestyles. The most widely used method is to use three coins. For
reasons I shall explain shortly, I prefer a method using beads of
four different colors.
    What I believe is most important in imitating the traditional
experience is replicating the probabilities of the ancient yarrow
stick method. The procedure should result in some moving lines,
but not an excessive number. Here is a table that compares odds
of three methods.

		                      Yarrow 	          Beads 	           Coin
6 Changing yin	         1 in 16	          1 in 16	          2 in 16
7 Fixed yang	           5 in 16	          5 in 16	          6 in 16
8 Fixed yin	            7 in 16	          7 in 16	          6 in 16
9 Changing yang	        3 in 16	          3 in 16	          2 in 16
	                 HOW TO CONSULT THE I CHING	                       389



The first thing to notice here is that the probabilities are not
identical—coins give more moving yin lines. The reason I find this
problematic is not because of anything supernatural, but because
changing lines result in more possibilities and therefore a less clear
divination. Worst in this regard is a modern device consisting of six
four-sided sticks, each side of which has one of the four kinds of
lines. Casting these sticks is quick but results in about half the lines
being moving. Of course, anyone is free to generate hexagrams by
any method. There is even a way to do it using car license plate
numbers, or any other sequence of digits. My suggestions are
based on trying to replicate the traditional experience as closely as
possible, 3,000 years later.
    For those interested in I Ching consultation as a regular practice,
unless he or she believes that a particular method has supernatural
efficacy, it is simply a matter of preference. Asking advice is highly
personal and so it is best to choose a method that feels comfortable.
In explaining this I am not recommending regular I Ching consul-
tation, but see no reason to discourage it either.



                  Yarrow stalk sorting
This is the method referred to in ancient sources. A bundle of
fifty dried stems of the yarrow plant are repeatedly divided until
the number of remaining sticks determines the kind of line. The
process is repeated six times to generate the full hexagram and
takes at least 20 minutes. We do not know how the sticks were
manipulated originally, but at least two reconstructed methods
are available. Most commonly referred to is that of Zhu Xi. He
based this on his interpretation of Dazhuan 1.9, which refers
to the process but without sufficient detail. A modern version is
somewhat simpler and yields the numbers 6, 7, 8, and 9 directly.
Most will find yarrow too tedious for regular use, but it is worth
trying it a few times to gain a sense of the care Chinese put into
consultation of the Changes.
390	             THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



                     The coin method
The coin method is the most widely used, though not the best.
Three coins are used, preferably imitation Chinese cash coins.
All three are tossed simultaneously for each line. Heads, or the
side with fewer Chinese characters, count as yin, assigned the
number 2, and tails are yang, assigned 3. The numbers are totaled
to yield 6, 7, 8, or 9, which are the numbers that refer to each of
the four line types. Each toss produces a line, so six are necessary.
The first line obtained is the base, number 1, the last one is line 6.


        Bead method (method of sixteen)
I prefer this method because it replicates the yarrow stick proba-
bilities, but is much easier to perform. While almost as quick as
the coin method it is more contemplative and does not result in as
many moving lines.
   One acquires sixteen beads as follows (the colors are arbitrary):

   5   white or yellow for fixed yang
   7   black for fixed yin
   3   red for changing yang
   1   blue for changing yin

Chinese cloisonné beads create the right ambiance. They are kept
in a silk purse and taken out one at a time without looking. The
line is recorded, the bead replaced in the purse, and the next one
selected, until all lines have been determined. It is necessary to
replace the bead so all are in the purse for each line selection.
   Whether it is necessary to duplicate the probabilities of the
ancient method is a matter of taste. The present author prefers to
do so but many practitioners are content with the coin method.


             The method of remainders
It is even possible to pick a hexagram from license plate numbers
and other contemporary environmental annoyances, such as stock
	                HOW TO CONSULT THE I CHING	                     391



prices, airline flight numbers or arrival times, or any other random
digits one encounters. The first number is then divided progres-
sively by 8 until there is a remainder of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, or 7. The 0 is counted as 8. One then counts around the bagua
until the number is reached, which is the bottom trigram. The
process is then repeated on another number for the upper trigram;
this can be another from one’s surroundings, or the date or time
(Huang 2000: 175–8).



                     Other methods
Other than the physical manipulation, the major difference between
methods is the number of changing lines obtained. The two sets of
dice seen by the present author use different systems. One has two
dice of eight sides each, upon which are embossed the characters
for the trigrams. A third die has six sides and is used to decide
which line is changing. In this method, the number of lines that
change is decided by the inquirer. Another set has the usual six
sides; each die has two fixed yin and yang lines and one changing
line for each, giving a probability of 3/18 for each kind of changing
line. Another system, using six sticks of four sides, has a very high
8/16 probability of a changing line. Too many changing lines, at
least in the opinion of the present author, makes for confusion.
    There is an extreme variety of other methods, including six-sided
dice with trigrams, sticks, pendulums, dials, and numerological
methods based on birth date. A rather obscure numerological
passage in the Dazhuan 1.9 provides a pretext for many of these
systems, otherwise without basis in the I Ching.
    The most famous figure associated with the numerological
approach is Shao Yong of the Song, who in turn influenced Zhu
Xi, as discussed in Chapter 8. Numerological approaches interest
mainly a very few who possess a certain sort of cognitive dispo-
sition that becomes entranced by number inter-relationships and
finds spiritual meaning in them. These elaborate numerological
methods are mere curiosities that diverge from the main received
tradition and do not help us understand the Zhouyi as a text.
392	           THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



             Interpreting the response
There are countless ways one can interpret hexagrams and their
texts. How one interprets depends in part on the nature of one’s
interest. Some use the Changes only for casual divination and
do not feel a need to know much about the traditional Chinese
context. Those with a more serious interest will use divination to
supplement their study of the place of the classic in Chinese intel-
lectual history.
   Divination is actually a skill. People who frequently patronize
diviners, whether using I Ching, psychics (purely mental without
any device), astrologers or Tarot readers, report that some diviners
are much better than others. Some of this is clearly cold reading—
throwing out suggestions and picking up on those to which the
inquirer responds. While it is easy to deceive the gullible, as do
spiritualist mediums who channel the deceased husbands of elderly
widows, skilled readers are much more subtle.
   In reading for oneself, keep in mind that interpretation is almost
always metaphorical. This means free associating based on the line.
As an example, consider line 47.3, “Entering into his house, he
does not see his wife, ominous.” Although this could be interpreted
as his wife having left him, or even having died, such needlessly
disturbing interpretations should be avoided. More appropriate
possibilities could be that she has gone shopping, or that he does
not adequately recognize her concerns or needs. If the inquirer is
single, it might mean he is not thinking of marrying his present
partner, or that he has not met anyone suitable. Genders can be
switched as suitable for the situation.
   Divination with the reconstructed early meanings of the Zhouyi
would be a completely different experience to using a translation
like that of Wilhelm-Baynes, which is based on the later Confucian
moralistic meanings. With the present translation I suggest using it
as the basis for a thought experiment, asking questions hypotheti-
cally as if one were living in the Western Zhou. I cannot imagine
anyone would want to be transported back in time to that era. I
have carried out this thought experiment frequently while doing
this translation and found it humbling to realize how much easier
our lives are than those of people who lived 3,000 years ago.
                              10
           The challenges of
         translating the Zhouyi


To begin with a banality, the Chinese language is different. While
it is not the purpose of this book to teach Chinese, knowledge of
some aspects of the language will be both extremely helpful in
understanding the Zhouyi in translation, and also, I hope, intrinsi-
cally interesting. Even for those with no intention of learning any
Chinese, a sense of how the language works will improve one’s
appreciation of its writings.
    In this chapter I provide additional details regarding textual
criticism of the Zhouyi for those who, like me, are fascinated by the
possibility of reconstructing the meanings of ancient texts.


       Being optimistic about translation
It is a cliché that translation is impossible. This is expressed in a
particularly pessimistic way by Nietzsche scholar, James L. Porter:

  Philology invents for itself an antiquity it can then go on to
  “discover.”

And:

  The aim of philology, critically conceived, is not to substitute
  a more adequate picture of the ancients but to bring out inade-
  quacies of the one we already have. (6)
394	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



These observations are not so much wrong as limited. Turning our
inability to attain absolute certainty into a nihilistic conclusion that
any text can mean anything—or nothing—is a self-defeating view
peculiar to recent humanities scholarship. The hard sciences admit
that knowledge is incomplete and work away patiently to fill in the
gaps without fretting over the situation. The social sciences, which
are less exact, also make their peace with uncertainty. After all, if
everything were known, all of us knowledge workers would be out
of jobs.
   Philology is not exactly a hard science, but it is not completely
soft, either. It works with precise data—texts in all their multi-
plicity—though interpretation is debated incessantly, frequently
productively. What Porter describes is in fact the nature of the
sciences. We form a hypothesis, test it, then modify it. Philology
will never attain complete certainty about the meanings of ancient
texts, just as astronomy will never discover the full details of
distant galaxies. All we can do is work toward progressively more
complete knowledge. Similarly, without a time machine, we will
never fully experience what it was like to live in a remote time,
but we can get some sense about it. No doubt any attempted
reconstruction of ancient meanings, my own included, gets some
of it wrong. Yet if we lose confidence in our ability to reconstruct
humanity’s past, we abandon our heritage. Some are willing to
make this choice; I am not.
   I suspect my background in medicine has affected my attitude.
In medicine, one is faced with an urgent problem and while all too
aware of what we do not know, we have to do something—waiting
until knowledge is complete is not an option. We do not allow
epistemological controversies to stop us from applying what we
do know. I suggest that in philology, as with medicine, uncertainty
should be reason for humility, not defeatism.
   A less pessimistic way to approach translation is as an extended
sequence of hard—but not impossible—choices. With the Zhouyi,
nearly every word has multiple possible meanings, which in English
are completely different words. I have chosen the meanings that
seem most likely to me, in the context of the text and of what we
know of Western Zhou life.
   Effective translation requires, in my view, the ability to put
oneself in the imaginaire of the time and place of the work. It is not
only language that makes translation challenging. With the Zhouyi
	       THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSLATING THE ZHOUYI	                  395



the translator must find a way to convey to the reader the nature
of life in a time when banditry was rife, warfare almost continuous,
human sacrifice performed as a social obligation, and individual
autonomy was almost non-existent. Men of high rank were better
off—but not entirely. While they could execute followers at whim,
they might fall victims to those even more powerful. Regarding
women’s lives in this remote era, regrettably, we know very little.
A few seem to have been able to make basic decisions about their
lives, but most probably were subject to fathers, husbands, and
more senior wives.
    The study of divination is the study of human uncertainties. For
moderns, divination is occasional and often just for entertainment,
but in the ancient world it might be used for almost any decision
regarding everyday matters such as travel, banquets, offerings,
marriage, even when to have intercourse. Both translating and
reading requires recognition of the extreme insecurity of ancient
life. (Recognition does not mean excusing such cruelties as human
sacrifice, mutilating punishment, or routine abuse of children
and women. We cannot change the past but we can use it to be
conscious of how easily human behavior can go awry.) We need to
keep in mind that decisions that the Zhouyi was consulted about
would have been made in conditions very different from those in the
modern world. Daily life was fraught with innumerable hazards:
brigands, warfare, crop failure, disease, death in childbirth, spiteful
ancestors and spirits, and the imperative of conforming to complex
ritual requirements. The resources for coping with such dangers
were very limited compared to those available in the modern world.
There were no weather forecasts, no sound medical diagnosis and
no effective treatments. There was no aid for the destitute without
family. To give an example from ordinary life, in the Wu Ding
oracle bone inscriptions queries about toothache were frequent.
What for us would be a simple, if unpleasant, trip to the dentist
was a cause of long-term pain, often agonizing, with magic spells
the only alternative to agonizing extraction without anesthesia.
Thus much of daily life would have been fraught with dread. With
this perspective, what now tends to be dismissed as superstition
can be seen as one of the few resources against personal or public
disaster. Modern translations of the Book of Changes, influenced
by the New Age Movement, tend to put its prognostications in the
language of personal growth, suitable for the dilemmas of easeful
396	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



modern lives. For the denizens of the Chinese Bronze Age there was
no such concept. Life was about basics, mainly survival.
   With this in mind, we can recognize the intimate relationship
between divination and emotion. Early Chinese texts do not often
refer directly to emotion, but tend to tersely describe a situation
and leave the reader to infer the emotion. Put differently, the
Zhouyi is an assembly of images and, as with images generally,
their impact is direct and only later, if at all, does abstract expla-
nation arise. With the Zhouyi, interpretation would be left to
the reader or listener during the course of the actual divination.
In my view, translation should not add emotion words that are
not in the text, and should leave the images consistent with the
feelings that likely accompanied them. Although the Zhouyi only
rarely mentions emotions, one should try to imagine the feelings of
those involved in the situations described as a means to feel some
connection with the lives of the ancients. Sometimes the emotions
are directly apparent, as with the bride upstaged by her bridesmaid
in 54.5. In 18, the references to parental sexual behavior affecting
the child indicate anxiety about how parents affect the child, no
less a cause of anxiety today, though our beliefs are different.
The castration of the stallion in 54 must have stirred very intense
emotion: the danger to those performing the deed, the soaking of
the participants with blood, relief when it is over that the horse
bolts away, and a sense of human power over the animal world.
All these contrast with contemporary Western notions of animal
rights, yet early civilization depended on exploitation of animals.
   When making a divinatory inquiry, there is a mixture of hope
and fear. The oracle may reassure by proposing the safest course of
action in a risky situation, though in this it is hardly infallible. But
there is the possibility of a bad prognostication, particularly that
the inquirer might hear what no one wants to know, for example,
the day of one’s death. (In the Western renaissance diviners did
make such predictions, with what psychological effect we do not
know.)
   Referring to translation as “resurrection,” Tsai comments, “On
the road to ‘resurrection’ there are difficulties and obstacles too
numerous to count” (Tsai: 141–52).
   I like this quote because it expresses these difficulties in super-
natural terms, something that fits with the occult nature of the
Changes. Resurrection is unnatural and more than a little scary.
	       THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSLATING THE ZHOUYI	                  397



A person brought back from the dead is dangerous and so is the
Zhouyi—not only when used to prognosticate but also in reminding
us of human sacrifice and practices that we would prefer not to
think about, and that we wrongly imagine have vanished from
the modern world. So engaging with the resurrected Zhouyi can
produce anxious moments. It also induces anxiety in the translator.
Though done in safe, comfortable settings, somehow struggling to
restore to life a very ancient—and highly valued—literary work
seems a high-stakes undertaking.



    Text-critical controversies and early
                Chinese texts
Western textual criticism has developed primarily to distinguish
the correct reading when there are multiple surviving versions
(“witnesses”) of a text. Theorizing about this began in antiquity
and reached a considerable degree of sophistication; philology as
a modern discipline developed in Germany during the nineteenth
century. Much of that scholarship focused on the textual problems
in editing of Greek New Testament texts, of which a very large
number survive, created over several centuries. The stakes were
high, given that from the perspective of a believer, the correct
text was the actual word of God. The stakes are high too for
the historian who wants to know what actually happened, or
the literary critic who would like to understand how the variant
versions are related to each other and how they originated. While
all scholars are, or should be, concerned with accuracy, there are
significant differences in approach. For the Biblical scholar the ideal
would be a single correct reading. The historian, especially in the
case of China, is interested in what the early texts tell us about life
in the era they are studying. In this situation variants may be useful.
Biblical criticism is split into two camps. Faith-based scholars
want to restore authentic scripture—though now more likely to
be accepting of uncertainties than was the case in the past—and in
contrast, those who are skeptical of traditional beliefs, or regard
religion as delusion, tend toward a debunking agenda, somewhat
akin to the Chinese Doubting Antiquity Movement. A positive
development is that modern scholars tend to accept the existence
398	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



of variant versions rather than assuming a single correct “urtext,”
and this limits quibbles over establishing a proposed single correct
reading.
    The study of texts has become somewhat fraught during the
past half-century With the influence of continental “theory,” and
its tropes of the death of the author, difference, and deconstruction,
philology came under attack. Close reading was eclipsed by a
focus on power interests, following the lead of Michel Foucault.
This movement in literary scholarship has had limited influence
on the study of pre-modern Chinese texts. One reason is that
with ancient texts, the very basic—and challenging—first step is
to work out what the text actually says. Until this is done, social
analysis is dubious at best. Simply put, philology is necessary for
us to know our past. Another impetus for the revival of Chinese
textual criticism is the need for such expertise in analyzing the
numerous previously unknown works discovered in archaeological
excavation. There are of course matters of national pride involved
when any culture’s classics are discussed, though this is not neces-
sarily directly stated. (For a very different point of view regarding
political aspects of textual scholarship, see Warren.)
    The Doubting Antiquity Movement was invaluable in restoring
the early meanings of the Zhouyi, yet, at least in my view, in their
zeal to discredit the received meanings they introduced gratuitous
obscurities. I have tried to apply a more temperate approach in the
present translation.
    The project to reconstruct the early meanings of the Zhouyi
has itself stirred up yet another controversy. Most I Ching aficio-
nados and practitioners simply ignored the Doubting Antiquity
Movement critique, while some have vigorously disputed it.
Bradford Hatcher, a self-taught sinologist, has published criti-
cisms of New Changes Studies, which he refers to as “Context
Criticism” (I: 16–42). (I have discussed his views in more detail in
the chapter on philosophy.) The controversy about the Doubting
Antiquity Movement is analogous to the split in Biblical criticism—
the inevitable tension between believers, who are attached to the
mythology of the Changes and read it for spiritual inspiration,
and scholars whose work employs an evidence-based approach.
Indeed, the same tension between believers and scholars exists for
spiritual or religious texts generally. Diversity of approaches to
difficult material is ultimately productive. Such controversies are
	      THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSLATING THE ZHOUYI	                399



by their nature not fully resolvable, and need not be. The simple
solution is peaceful co-existence. Since my goal in the present work
is historical reconstruction, I have not said much about I Ching as
a practice. In part this is to restore balance—most English versions
of the Changes are in the believer/practioner school. Some practi-
tioners have quite interesting observations to offer regarding the
Changes. It was, after all, intended not so much to be read as to be
used. However, the practice of I Ching, ancient and modern, is a
subject for another time.



                Analogy and anomaly
Translating most modern works does not require much theoretical
reflection. The translator develops a sense of the text and then
works to decide the best equivalents in the target language. With
ancient texts there are additional complexities, and some reflection
on theoretical issues is necessary to produce a coherent version
based on an as accurate a copy of the text as possible.
   In China, textual criticism developed in two stages, which can
be compared to the analogy and anomaly schools of Western
antiquity, to be described shortly. First was the Evidentiary
Scholarship movement of the late Qing Dynasty, foreshadowed
in the Song (Elman 2001). This movement strived for accuracy
but did not aim to refute tradition, hence it was not unlike the
method of analogy. Later, as discussed previously, the more radical
Doubting Antiquity Movement, advanced something akin to a
hermeneutics of suspicion, resulting in a complete transformation
of the received view of the ancient portion of the text. Many
anomalous readings were introduced by assuming that characters
in the received versions were actually homophones for other words.
Indeed, they seem to have preferred meanings that did not fit the
later Confucian orthodox readings. In English, the main exponents
of this approach have been Richard Kunst, Edward Shaughnessy,
and Richard Rutt. This movement has been extremely influential
in the Western scholarly approach to the Chinese classics and
continues to be applied in China, but has not supplanted the
received tradition there. The Doubting Antiquity approach has
less relevance to the work of such scholars as Richard John Lynn
400	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



and Richard J. Smith, whose interests are mainly in later I Ching
commentaries.
   In the Classical West, there was a theoretical controversy
about the proper way to establish authoritative editions of texts
(Greetham: 296–302). The argument was between the followers of
Aristotle, based in Alexandria, and the Stoics, based in Pergamon.
The former held to analogy, which considered language to be based
on regular patterns, while the latter, referred to as the “school
of anomaly,” emphasized irregularities. These terms applied not
only to the proper way to establish correct texts, but also to their
exegesis. The Alexandrian school held to the slogan, “Let scripture
interpret scripture,” a principle also referred to as, “The analogy of
faith.” In practice this meant emending to create a text in harmony
with the editor’s notion of the intended meaning. There is, of
course, no ultimate escape from subjectivity in textual scholarship.
   The method of analogy is not wrong—texts do have some
degree of internal consistency in vocabulary, sentence structure
and ideas; elements that do not fit the normal pattern need to be
questioned. Those favoring anomaly, on the other hand, prefer to
let variants stand and allow the text its irregularities and contra-
dictions. (I am indebted to Professor Dai Lianbin’s presentation at
the Association of Asian Studies 2014 Conference for this way of
categorizing different modes of textual criticism.) This approach
has the advantage of preserving interesting oddities, but can
overlook lacunae and later additions.
   With the Zhouyi, neither approach can be applied rigidly. As I
have emphasized, the ancient text is almost certainly a collection of
fragments from different sources about which we know little. Thus
anomalies could result from different sources or different editors—
or scribal errors. On the other hand, many passages are ambiguous
enough that we have no choice but to translate them to accord
with the overall style of the work. Given that there is no final,
objective criterion for determining which variant reading is correct,
selection often comes down to that indefinable faculty referred to
as “judgment.” This was the conclusion of Johann Albrecht Bengel
(1687–1752), one of the greatest of textual critics.
   This brings us to “Bengel’s rule,” usually expressed as, “The
more difficult reading is to be preferred.” This rule was proposed
in relation to New Testament Greek manuscripts and was based
on the assumption that scribes would take it upon themselves to
	        THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSLATING THE ZHOUYI	                 401



“clarify” obscure passages in scriptures they regarded as sacred.
This assumption has in fact been refuted by statistical studies
of New Testament manuscripts. I do occasionally hear Bengel’s
supposed rule quoted by sinologists, and suspect it is often tacitly
applied. To the best of my knowledge there has been no formal
study of its suitability for application to Chinese texts. In my
opinion its use results in gratuitous obscuration.
   It was actually Johann Jakob Griesbach (1745–1812) who
put the rule into its now familiar, rather rigid formulation. What
Bengel actually wrote is rather different:

    A reading, which does not allure by too great facility, but shines
    with its own native dignity of truth, is always to be preferred to
    those which may fairly be supposed to owe their origin to either
    the carelessness or the injudicious care of copyists (quoted in
    Marlowe).

Thus Bengel held, not that the least clear reading is invariably to be
selected, but that too facile readings must be questioned—a quite
different guideline. This point is important because in recent times
critical examination of scriptural texts has often been intended to
discredit them. This is true not only of Biblical scholarship, but
also of the Doubting Antiquity Movement. The seminal figures
of modern textual Western textual criticism, such as Bengel, saw
their task differently, as trying to recover the exact revealed words
that were the foundation of their faith. Philogists studying secular
literary texts usually base their work on a deep respect for their
authors and a belief that their exact words are of particular value.
My own teacher, Fredson Bowers of the University of Virginia, was
of this persuasion.
    With texts such as the Zhouyi, the early meanings only reveal
themselves with the aid of meticulous, rigorous examination.
Almost any phrase can be read in a way that is difficult, so if the
more difficult reading were always accepted, the text would be
reduced to gibberish. While there is no end to the tension between
analogy and anomaly, there can be a middle ground. To my mind,
many of the existing translations of the I Ching fail to find this
middle ground, either rewriting the text, as did Wilhelm-Baynes, or
making it needlessly obscure, as did Richard Rutt. While both trans-
lations are of great value, neither is definitive, as indeed no version
402	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



can be. My own goal has been to produce a translation based on
the early meanings, but as easy to understand as possible —which
led me to formulate my working principle that if the Zhouyi was
understood 3,000 years ago it can be understood today.



                          Ambiguity
The great classicist Eric Havelock proposed that logic was invented
in Greece because the Greek alphabet was the first to include vowels.
These were (and still are) lacking in Hebrew and the other Semitic
languages. Walter Ong went farther and proposed that the rise of
logic in Greece was also due to the formal study of rhetoric, that is,
use of language to convince (2002: 482). The basis for this seemingly
chauvinistic theory is the fact that a fully alphabetic language has
a lower level of ambiguity. Without entering into a debate about
why something did not happen, it still must be pointed out that
the Chinese language, particularly the ancient form, contains a
much higher degree of ambiguity than modern European written
languages. A major cause of this ambiguity is the extreme polysemy
of Chinese. The modern language reduces this by using binomes
(that is two characters rather than one to denote a word), but these
are infrequent in the early language, making meanings much more
context-dependent than is the case for English (Melzer: 49). A further
problem is the lack of grammatical inflections due to the nature of
the Chinese writing system. While there are many characters that
serve as grammatical markers, they too are often ambiguous and are
not much used in the Zhouyi. As a result there are no noun cases,
no verb tenses, no designation of singular or plural. Pronouns are
infrequent and ungendered. For the most part grammar is indicated
by word order, but lack of punctuation in early and classical Chinese
makes it often unclear where one sentence ends and another begins.
Despite all this, Chinese communicate with each other as efficiently
as do people of any other language and created one of the world’s
great literary and philosophical traditions.
   The real difficulty that ambiguity poses for the translator is not
that of finding the best English meaning. Rather it is the necessity
of reducing multiple meanings to single ones. This is particularly
problematic with very early Chinese.
	       THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSLATING THE ZHOUYI	                 403



    Chad Hansen points out:

    What the translation paradigm ignores is that many alter-
    native translation equivalents could make sense of each isolated
    sentence containing the term (8).

He further observes that English translations of Chinese texts tend
to fix the meaning, giving the mistaken implication that there is one
correct meaning, which it is the translator’s task to recognize and
represent in the target language. I would add that the assumption
that all, or even most, readers in the original language would
construe ambiguous passages identically is unlikely. It is entirely
plausible, indeed probable, that early Chinese readers or listeners
understood phrases in multiple ways. Thus meanings were multiple.
Particularly in a text used for divination, multiple meanings would
increase the apparent accuracy of its prognostications.
   I think this problem is quite real, but not quite as bad as Hansen
suggests. Often most of the possible meanings can be excluded by
context. Others do not greatly affect the meaning and tone of the
text. Finally, and most importantly, translators can and should alert
readers to important ambiguities and disclose their assumptions
about the text that determine how they translate. My key assump-
tions are: first, that the text was originally understandable and
second, that it is about common matters of daily life and concrete
rather than abstract, in other words, it is pre-axial. Furthermore, it
seems unashamed of violence, though many translators have toned
this down, and, finally, it does not seem to care about consistency.
   Ambiguity is inherent in the Zhouyi and there is no definitive
solution to the problems this poses in translating. To represent
many possible meanings for the same character would result in
unreadability. Nor should we, as one translator has, ask readers
to turn back to a glossary to select the meanings they like best.
Accordingly, I have included variant possible meanings when they
seem particularly important, but not in all cases. I also point out
to readers some instances in which my renderings diverge from
those of other translators, acknowledging that both may be correct.
Obviously, part of my reason for doing this is 无咎 wu jiu: to have
no blame.
   There is yet another source of uncertainty in reconstructing the
early meanings of the words. This is frequency of scribal variation
404	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



or homophone substation. The script was not standardized and
scribes often wrote a different character of similar sound in
place of the correct one. Such substitutions were frequent. The
relative paucity of phonemes in the Chinese language results in
a high frequency of homophones—words of different meanings
that sound the same. To give an extreme example, in Schuessler’s
Dictionary of Early Zhou Chinese, characters pronounced fu have
fifteen pages of definitions (if all four tones are included). English
has relatively few such homophones. Words such as “there” and
“their” or “weather” and “whether” are easily distinguished in
context.
    Deciphering homophone substitutions depends on recon-
struction of the sounds of a language that has not been heard
for more than two thousand years. While these reconstructions
have been essential to recovering the Western Zhou meanings,
they have also given philologists the opportunity to be overly
creative in substituting improbable meanings for self-evident ones.
A notable example is 4.0 蒙 meng translated by Wilhelm-Baynes
as Youthful Folly and by me as the similar Neophytes, but
emended by Waley to Dodder, a kind of weed. (I discuss this in
more detail in my commentary to this hexagram.) Fortunately,
phonetic reconstruction is moving toward consensus and scholars
are more conservative about unsupported emendations. In China
there is even a Trusting Antiquity Movement that is less willing to
arbitrarily set aside received traditions.
    Despite all these conundrums, it is possible to reconstruct the
early texts with a reasonable degree of certainty, most of the
time. As always, there are intense debates among scholars about
details—this is part of the fun. Historical phonetic reconstruction
is extremely complex and there are only a handful of scholars
competent in this esoteric discipline. (For an up-to-date account,
though not discussing the Zhouyi, see Baxter and Sargent.) The
present translation could not have been made without the pains-
taking work of Chinese and Western philologists, on whose
findings I have relied in identifying homophones. I have, however,
made my own decisions about which meaning is most likely to be
the correct one, based on my study of the text and its era.
	       THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSLATING THE ZHOUYI	                     405



       My principles for this translation
Having itemized some of the challenges faced by the translator
of ancient or classical Chinese, I will now describe some of my
strategies responding to them. In stating them I am following the
trend for full disclosure, believing that fairness to readers requires
revealing one’s assumptions.
    First, I have tried to be as literal as possible not only with respect
to meanings, but also the terseness and word order of the original.
I have only altered these when necessary for comprehension. When
the original itself is semantically awkward, I usually have not
altered meaning for the sake of smoother flow. Some awkwardness
is inevitable because the work is extremely terse and was composed
from a collection of fragments. When necessary for clarity and ease
of reading, I have sparingly added grammatical words regularly
omitted in Chinese, such as pronouns, conjunctions, and definite
and indefinite articles. I have only rarely added substantive words
to the source text but instead have provided clarifications in the
commentary. Fortunately, unlike some other ancient languages
such as Sanskrit, there is no problem in separating words because
each character stands for a single word. The characters are
modular, made up of smaller characters, often with both semantic
and phonetic elements, though these are of limited help in figuring
out meaning and sound for a rare character.
    I have chosen gender neutral words, except when the gender
is apparent in context. While I do not doubt that such terms as
人 ren, person, or 君子 junzi, prince or upright person, almost
always refer to males, I see no need to add grammatical male
gender when it does not exist in the source text. While women
unquestionably usually occupied a subordinate place, some clearly
had agency as indicated in the oracle bone inscriptions and the
Zuozhuan, among other texts. We need to know more about the
place of women in bronze-age China and should not assume that
autonomy was available solely to males. It would be particularly
interesting to learn how exceptional women succeeded, such as Fu
Hao, the second wife of King Wu Ding, who was able to become
a powerful general.
    Despite these good intentions, I have often been less literal than I
hoped to be. I feel supported in this by the view of Michael Nylan:
406	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



   translators … should also feel free to disregard the original word
   order in Chinese, if doing so creates more readable English.
   Only pedantry prevents such rearrangements … (2014)

However, I believe that the goal of more readable English can be
attained without rewriting the Chinese text; an all too common
practice.
    An important part of translating the Zhouyi, rarely mentioned,
is the addition of punctuation, of which there is none in the
original. Though this narrows the possible meanings of the text—
originally just strings of characters—it is essential to clarity. Most
problematic, until commas or periods are added it is often unclear
if a noun is the object of the preceding verb or the subject of
the next.
    Placement of a comma or period does often reduce the number of
possible meanings, but it is necessary for modern readers, who do
not have access to a traditionally educated teacher who has spent
a lifetime studying that specific text. All punctuation represents the
opinion of the translator as to the intended structure of phrases. I
have tried to be judicious in the addition of punctuation, but much
of the text would be incomprehensible without it. However, readers
should be aware that punctuation is part of the translation. I have
tried to limit punctuation to two sorts of situation: for smoother
reading when placement is unambiguous, and when the meaning is
completely obscure without it. Any reader is justified in imagining
how meanings would change if commas, semicolons and periods
were moved around in the line text.
    I have made abundant use of dashes. These can be an author’s
best friend because they connect phrases without leaving open the
exact nature of their relationship. I justify this by the nature of the
original, which tends to leave it to the reader to figure out how
phrases relate to each other—or if they do at all.
    Another central issue in translation is how strict to be in trans-
lating source words consistently into the target language. My
view, at least for the Zhouyi, is that translating the same word
inconsistently conceals patterns of meaning that are important for
full appreciation of the text. This is particularly important with
prognostic words such as 利 li beneficial; 吉 ji auspicious; 吝 lin
regret; 凶 xiong ominous; 无咎 wu jiu no blame; 君子 junzi upright
person, etc. Prognostications may seem monotonous to us, but they
	       THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSLATING THE ZHOUYI	                  407



were of the greatest importance to early readers. Consistent trans-
lation is necessary to reveal the thought patterns that determined
the favorable and the ominous.
   A contrary view is expressed by Lauren Pfister:

    Representatives of both Protestant and French academic tradi-
    tions in the first half of the nineteenth century tended to
    standardize translations for key terms, leaving no room for
    contextual nuance or connotative differences. This kind of error
    Legge self-consciously avoided. (2001: 405f.)

The problem with this is that Legge, Wilhelm-Baynes and other
early translators lacked a historical conception of the text, resulting
in many of the “conceptual nuances” being the creations of the
translators themselves. Nor, as Legge’s translation demonstrates,
does this approach necessarily result in clarity or readability. (The
notorious black magician and iconoclast Aleister Crowley cruelly
derided the Oxford Professor of Chinese as “Wood’n Legge,”
referring to his prose style.)
    I have made a particular effort to avoid the use of words and
concepts that would have been anachronistic in the Western Zhou.
This is especially important with the psychological language that is
so embedded in modern English as to usually pass unnoticed. This
has predominated in writings on the I Ching, ever since Carl Jung’s
1949 Foreword to the Wilhelm-Baynes translation. While I think
the great Swiss psychologist’s Foreword is one of the best places to
start study of the Changes, it is only a start. Now that many more
of us in the West are familiar with Chinese culture and ideas, I feel
the time is ripe for a translation that tries to give a sense of how
the Changes was read in its own time. While I see nothing inher-
ently wrong with translating the Changes in psychological terms
for those who find it helpful in their personal lives, I think those
who are curious about the work deserve to be able to read it on
its own terms.
    In reading translations of diverse Chinese texts over the years,
and comparing them with their originals, I have the strong
impression that many translators modify them into what they wish
they said. I have done my best to avoid this. In fact, there is much
in the Western Zhou text that I strongly dislike, particularly the
frequent and unapologetic references to state-sponsored violence.
408	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



Another mistake I have tried to avoid is mixing up literal meanings
with divinatory ones. Divinatory texts exist on at least two levels.
One is what the text says directly, the other is how it is applied to
the particular situations divined about. Given the persuasive power
of divination, the Book of Changes was frequently used to serve
political agendas, for example the politically expedient reading by
the Kangxi Emperor (504). A divination from the Book of Changes
can, of course, serve personal agendas as well, often as a reason
for not doing something. Given its supernatural aura, it is hard to
convince a believer that a prognostication is wrong.
   My journey back in time to the Chinese Bronze Age has been a
fascinating one for me, and I hope my translation will enable my
readers to share this experience.



           Notes on other translations
If I thought another translation of the I Ching was definitive, I
would not have embarked on my own. In fact, given the ambiguity
of the text, its 3,000 years of history, the many speculations that
have been applied to it, there can be no single valid translation.
Since some readers are likely to have encountered other translations,
a brief schematization of their differences and limitations might be
useful to those confused by the radically different English versions
of the same word in Chinese. Indeed, it is not unusual that transla-
tions differ so much as to seem to be from different texts altogether.
    I divide translations into three categories: sinologically sound,
literary, and New Age. There is some overlap between these
categories and within each there is considerable variety.
    Many of the most important versions are the work of Westerners
who are or were very knowledgeable about China, but who were
not academic sinologists. These include the missionary translators:
Canon Thomas McClatchie, James Legge, Richard Wilhelm, and
Richard Rutt. Also important to mention is the psychiatrist and
theorist of religion, Carl G. Jung. Though himself not a translator,
it was his circle in Switzerland that inspired Wilhelm and Baynes.
The I Ching continues to attract translators, such as myself, who
hold no academic position in Chinese studies. Others include Greg
Whincup, Cyrille Javary, author of the leading French translation,
	      THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSLATING THE ZHOUYI	                409



Chung Wu, whose work is the most complete exposition of trigram
interpretation in English, Kerson Huang, an MIT professor, Yale
Law Professor Jack Balkin, and Hong Kong marketing expert Mun
Kin Chok. Another translator with an interesting background is
Alfred Huang, one-time professor at Shanghai University, who
was “trained in secret by one of China’s greatest I Ching masters.”
Those translators whose study of the Changes took place in China
tend to have quite different ways of understanding the classic, and
this difference has not received the attention it merits. As these
examples show, the I Ching continues to possess a mystique that
has attracted a strikingly diverse group of scholars.
   The most important and sinologically sound translations are
those of James Legge, Richard Kunst (unfortunately only available
as an unpublished doctoral dissertation), Richard Rutt, Edward
L. Shaughnessy (of the excavated manuscripts), and John Richard
Lynn, whose work is based on the interpretations of Wang Bi
(226–249 ce). Among other translations of interest are those of
Greg Whincup and MIT professor Kerson Huang.
   Within this group there is a fundamental distinction between
those who worked to recreate the early Western Zhou meanings
and those who worked within the later received tradition. In
general, the early translators were scholars versed in classical
Chinese who worked from rigorous principles, but did not question
the late Qing Dynasty mode of exegesis. Richard Wilhelm, whose
work fits in this group, was aided by his Chinese informant Lao
Nai-hsuan (勞乃軒 Lao Naixuan), one of the last of the tradi-
tionally educated literati. James Legge’s translation was also based
on Chinese informants, but its ponderous diction makes it a hard
slog. A translation more in line with current scholarly standards,
though not based on the Western Zhou meanings, is that of
Richard John Lynn, whose version is based on the commentary of
Wang Bi (226–249 ce). Lynn’s work is groundbreaking in that it
is historical—he situates his translation within a specific time and
interpretive school. This should be, in my opinion, the way of the
future for translations of ancient texts—situating them within a
specific commentarial tradition or lineage.Earlier translations such
as those of Legge and Wilhelm-Baynes present it synchronically.
   A second category consists of literary translations. These are
based on sound knowledge of Chinese but translate more freely,
based on what is to me a dubious assumption—that aesthetics
410	            THE I CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)



takes precedence over accuracy. My own belief is that one should
strive to translate both accurately and gracefully—what I hope
I have achieved to some degree. Wilhelm-Baynes is of course,
the pre-eminent literary translation but basically an adaptation,
though an extremely influential one. Also in the category of
literary translation is the recent one of John Minford. It contains
much of interest but runs to over 800 pages, most of which are
commentary. Wilhelm-Baynes had a similar problem, exacerbated
by the unclear separation between different parts of the I Ching
itself and their commentary. My personal approach to commentary
is quite different—I strive to illuminate the meaning of the text but
do so concisely enough so as not to overwhelm it.
    Another sort of literary “translation” is that of David Hinton.
This is actually a series of prose poems very loosely based on the
Changes. One may or may not find it inspiring, but it is not the I
Ching. Regrettably it makes the Changes more obscure in English
than it is in Chinese. Such works are better regarded as imitations
rather than translations—akin to Ezra Pound’s Cathay, a major
work of English poetry, but not of translation.
    My third category is what I have termed New Age appro-
priations. These use the I Ching as a starting point for fashionable
ideas, usually without actual basis in the Chinese classic. This
category includes the work of Carol Anthony and Hanna Moog.
Though serious devotees of the I Ching, they repetitiously insist
that the Book of Changes is really about “overcoming the ego,”
a clichéd distortion of a Freudian concept with no basis in the
Changes. Such work perpetuates a fallacy akin to the “all religions
teach the same things” sort. By reducing the 3000-year-old classic
to pop psychology they deprive the reader of the opportunity to
encounter another way of thought.
    The “wickedest man in the world” as the press dubbed Aleister
Crowley (1875–1947) even produced a pseudo-translation in which
he mapped the hexagram array on the Cabalistic Tree of Life. Even
farther from the actual work are various I Chings intended to give
advice on romance, on becoming an author or life coach and, perhaps
oddest of all, the Toltec I Ching, whose authors were somehow privy
to the spiritual insights of an extinct culture that left no writings.
Common to these works seems to be using the prestige of the I Ching
to add allure to commonplace ideas. (For more on the problem of
English pseudo-translations see Redmond and Hon: 215–18.)
