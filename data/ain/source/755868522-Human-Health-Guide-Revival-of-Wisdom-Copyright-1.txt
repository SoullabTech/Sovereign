           ACIDITY VS ALKALINITY
Food that is genetically modified or created by humans tends to be acidic to the body.
Man-made (hybrid) and processed foods induce acidity within the body. when the
body is in an acidic environment, bacteria thrives, triggering the body to produce
surplus mucus to counteract the large volume of bacteria. Mucus serves as the body's
defense mechanism against toxins. However, an excess of mucus within the body can
potentially contribute to the development of various diseases. Additionally, anything
artificial or man-made has the potential to provoke cellular inflammation; each
instance of an organ or bodily area inflammation weakens its function and overall
health. This prolonged inflammation can eventually lead to organ failure over time.

Alkaline foods encompass fruits, plants, herbs, and vegetables that existed ,on the
earth, at the dawn of creation or were divinely made. Unlike hybrid man made foods,
alkaline foods can all be found thriving in the wild, growing on their own without
human intervention. Alkaline foods can be deemed "God's food," as they have been
created by a higher power for human consumption to promote health, vitality and
lognevity on the earth. These nutrient-rich foods support the gut microbiome, aiding
the cells in generating electrical energy.

The term "pH" indeed stands for "potential hydrogen." It represents the measurement
of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, indicating its acidity or alkalinity.
When we are born, our body is naturally alkaline, indicating that maintaining this
alkaline state is beneficial for overall health.

By eliminating acidic foods from our diet, we can reduce inflammation within the
body, allowing our body's electrical system to function smoothly as it should.
Consuming the wrong foods can challenge our digestive system and drain our energy
as our body struggles to digest them and combat toxins. By cutting out acidic foods,
our energy can be redirected towards other purposes, potentially elevating other
aspects of our lives.

                EATING CORRECTLY
Here are some guidelines on how to eat correctly:

   Ensure thorough chewing: Chew your food until it becomes a liquid consistency. The
   body struggles to digest large food chunks, but by chewing food to a liquid, the
   digestive system expends less energy in processing the food.

   Maintain regular meal times: Eat at consistent times each day to establish a rhythm
   for your body to efficiently process foods, optimizing its functionality.

   Avoid eating after sunset: The sun plays a vital role in aiding the body's various
   functions, including digestion. Whenever possible, try to eat during daylight hours
   to benefit from the sun's influence on food digestion.

   Be mindful of food combinations: Certain food combinations, such as grains and
   fruits, can be challenging for the digestive system to process efficiently. Mixing
   foods excessively can lead to digestive issues and drain your energy.

   Allow time before sleep: Leave at least four hours between your last meal and
   bedtime. Eating too close to bedtime hinders the body's ability to digest food
   effectively while lying down, potentially impacting the quality of your sleep. By
   giving your body time to digest before sleeping, you enable it to focus on
   recharging and regenerating during rest.

Digestion indeed requires a significant amount of energy. By following the guidelines
above, you can support your digestive system, allowing it to operate more efficiently
and thereby reducing the energy it consumes. This optimized digestion not only
conserves energy but also contributes to overall well-being and vitality.
                             VEGANISM
            NATURE PROVIDES YOU WITH EVERYTHING


Adrenochrome is a substance that Satanists consume to
induce a euphoric high. It is said to be blood containing       VEGANISM
adrenaline. Much of the meat available in markets today
comes from animals that have been captured, confined,
and subjected to a harrowing journey through
slaughterhouses, witnessing the slaughter of other
                                                               SAVING ME
animals before meeting their own demise. In this               An anagram from
terrifying environment, the animals experience intense         "veganism" is "saving
fear and anxiety, flooding their blood with adrenaline         me." Consuming flesh is
and other fear hormones. When these animals are                considered by some to be
consumed, these hormones ar transfered into the blood          a ritual with potential
of the consumer. Consuming flesh is akin to ingesting          effects on one's afterlife,
adrenaline, even when cooked, traces of blood persist in       associated with certain
the flesh of the deceased animal.                              belief systems.


                           YOU ARE NOT A COW
Cow milk is designed by nature to provide essential minerals and fats to newborn
calves, ensuring their robust growth. It contains all the nutrients necessary for a
healthy development of a cow, a pattern consistent across various species created by
God. Applying common sense, humans, being a distinct species, should reconsider
consuming milk specifically tailored for the growth of cows or other animals.
Moreover, the modern mass-scale production of milk involves frequent milking of
cows, causing them stress and leading to the release of stress hormones into the milk,
which is subsequently transferred to consumers.

A baby cow typically consumes its mother's milk until it is fully developed, at which
point it naturally stops. This is because the mother's milk provides essential minerals
and nutrients necessary for the baby cow to grow into a fully matured cow. Applying
common sense, one might question why humans continue to consume milk that is not
even from their own species.

Estrogen is naturally present in milk, as it is released from the mother cow's system.
Some researchers suggest that this estrogen in milk might affect the quality of male
sperm, potentially contributing to the observed decline in male fertility and
testosterone levels.
                               VEGANISM
                                     Carnivores such as tigers and lions typically have
         3-7ft       12-15ft         shorter intestinal lengths, ranging from 3 to 7 feet.
                                     In contrast, humans possess intestines that extend to
                                     approximately 15 feet in length. This notable
                                     difference suggests that, unlike carnivores reliant on
                                     flesh consumption, humans exhibit physiological
                                     features indicative of a plant-based diet. Both our
dental structure and intestinal length align with the characteristics of herbivores,
emphasizing our anatomical adaptation for consuming plants, fruits, and vegetables.


      CARNIVOR CREATURE                                   VEGAN CREATURE

Humans and plant-eating animals lack distinct features suggesting they are
carnivores. Unlike lions or other flesh-eating animals, humans do not possess claws for
tearing open flesh. Additionally, we lack long, sharp teeth designed for ripping flesh.
Instead, our flat, short teeth are adapted for chewing and consuming plants,
vegetables, and fruits.

Humans purchase neatly-wrapped packages of processed, washed, and trimmed
animal flesh, which is essentially rotting, treated with chemicals. They then cook it,
often adding oil, salt, seasonings, sauces, and condiments to mask the putrid smell and
taste of death, and consume it using utensils. This behavior starkly differs from that of
lions.

Why would a rational human mimic the eating habits of a wild animal? Why would
someone base their ethical behavior on the actions of a lion?

                           PARASITES IN FLESH
Another compelling reason to avoid consuming dead flesh is the presence of parasites.
These small worms can be created or transmitted through the foods we consume, with
a heightened likelihood of their existence in dead flesh. Dr. Sebi contends that over
80% of diseases are connected to parasites residing within individuals. It's suggested
that cravings may not solely be personal; parasites can influence the brain to obtain
the foods they thrive on, such as flesh, sugary foods, and processed foods.



                         YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT
Each species possesses inherent qualities bestowed by its celestial ruler. For instance,
bears exhibit strength and ferocity, cats exude majesty and sneakiness, and camels
showcase the ability to traverse vast distances. In medieval times, magicians
purportedly carried the heart of a bear to invoke qualities of strength and
relentlessness when necessary. Additionally, if they wished to remain awake
throughout the night, they would keep an owl's heart nearby to help them stay alert
and vigilant. These practices were believed to imbue the magician with specific virtues
or abilities associated with the animals' characteristics. Every living species harbors
celestial virtues that resonate through its body, mind, and spirit. When we partake in
the flesh of these beings, we assimilate the virtues associated with them. Consuming
chicken, for instance, allows the occult virtues of the chicken to transfer to the
consumer of its flesh. the term “you are what you eat” is quite literally true.

Scientific evidence supports the notion that every cell in the human body undergoes a
complete transformation approximately every 90 days. These cells derive their origin
from the food we ingest. Applying basic logic, the consumption of deceased animal
flesh may contribute to the gradual weakening of our cells, given the absence of life
and electricity in such flesh. Conversely, the intake of vibrant, living fruits containing
the solar electric charge is posited to facilitate cell regeneration, potentially slowing
down the aging process.
      PHYCOLOGICAL WAREFARE
The power of language in shaping our perceptions and behaviors is well-documented.
By employing more neutral or positive terms, the food industry aims to make the
consumption of poisons more palatable to the general population. Words and letters
are symbols imbued with metaphysical meanings or perceptions within our minds,
evoking either positive or negative associations. The food industry often utilizes terms
and symbols associated with positive energy to create a false perception of their
products, diverting consumers' attention from the reality of what they are actually
consuming.

Terms have been CREATED to conceal the true nature of what we consume. Instead of
using direct descriptors, We use softer words – referring to flesh as "meat," rancid
milk as "cheese," a pig's posterior as "ham," and a developing embryo as an "egg."
The intention behind this linguistic choice is to mitigate potential negative
psychological effects associated with consuming these products. The belief is that
fewer individuals would be inclined to consume a product named "cow flesh" or
"chicken fetus" if the true terminology were employed, as it taps into an innate
recognition that such choices may be ethically problematic.

Ingredients are often concealed on packaging or printed in small fonts, making them
difficult to read. Additionally, the area where ingredients are listed may appear
compact and visually unappealing, discouraging consumers from scrutinizing the
ingredient list. This intentional design aims to divert attention away from what
consumers are actually consuming. Such tactics are employed by large companies to
maximize sales and profits.

                                     This product prominently features the phrase
                                     "immune system" in bold writing to create the
                                     impression that it is beneficial for one's health.
                                     Additionally, the packaging utilizes the color green,
                                     often associated with nature, health, healing, and
                                     wellbeing. Furthermore, an image of a fruit is
                                     displayed, suggesting healthiness, despite the
                                     product likely containing artificial flavors to mimic
                                     the taste of the fruit rather than containing the
                                     whole fruit itself. This is necessary because including
the whole fruit would result in the product expiring within a few days. If the product
does contain real fruit, it would likely be packed with preservatives to extend its shelf
life and prevent it from spoiling. Despite the necessity of including preservatives and
added ingredients for shelf stability, it does not necessarily render the product healthy.
These additives can disrupt the gut microbiome, which plays a crucial role in overall
health. The gut is often referred to as the "second brain" due to its influence on various
bodily functions and processes. Therefore, while the product may appear healthy on
the surface, its impact on gut health should be considered.
      PHYCOLOGICAL WAREFARE




Children's cereal often features cartoon characters because marketers understand that
cartoons trigger recognition within their minds, as children regularly watch them on TV
programs. By incorporating these familiar characters onto the packaging, marketers
intentionally position them to look downward, making eye contact with children. This
tactic is strategic, as marketers recognize that children are typically smaller in height,
ensuring that the characters on the packaging are visually engaging and appealing to
their target audience.

Kids' cereals often utilize colorful packaging to attract children to their products.
Humans possess trichromatic vision, meaning our eyes and brains are wired to seek
out and respond to colors. Children, in particular, are highly sensitive to colors, which
is why companies choose vibrant and colorful packaging to appeal to them. This
strategy capitalizes on the natural inclination of children to be drawn to bright and
eye-catching visuals.

Companies often target children at a young age with sugary and artificial foods,
aiming to cultivate early addictions. This early exposure can lead to a lifelong
dependence on unhealthy foods if not addressed. Such habits established in childhood
can persist into adulthood, potentially leading to long-term health consequences if not
properly managed.

The subconscious mind of children is considered to be particularly receptive to
programming between the ages of 1 to 7. During this critical period of development,
children are highly impressionable and absorb information from their surroundings,
experiences, and interactions with others. This period is crucial for shaping beliefs,
attitudes, and behaviors that may persist into adulthood. Therefore, it is essential to
provide healthy habits and nurturing environments during these formative years to
support healthy development and positive outcomes later in life.
                   YOU ARE ELECTRIC
The elements present in our bodies, such as
sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium,
carry specific electrical charges. These charged
elements, known as ions, play a crucial role in
generating electricity within almost all of our
cells. Through processes like ion channels and
ion pumps, cells regulate the flow of these ions
across their membranes, creating electrical
gradients that are essential for various cellular
functions, including nerve signaling, muscle
contraction, and maintaining overall
physiological balance.

The human body operates as an intricate electrical machine. The brain serves as a
central electrical hub, transmitting signals throughout the nervous system to regulate
bodily functions. Our nervous system is inherently electric, orchestrating
communication between cells and organs through electrical impulses. Furthermore,
our cells possess the ability to conduct electricity, facilitating various physiological
processes.

In essence, our bodies function as biological batteries, relying on electricity to power
essential functions. Just like any battery, maintaining a sufficient charge is crucial for
optimal health and vitality.
                                        The universe is indeed governed by
                                        electromagnetism, with these principles
                                        underlying the behavior of all matter and
                                        energy. The Sun, as a massive celestial body,
                                        emits powerful electric rays characterized by a
                                        positive charge. These rays interact with the
                                        environment, positively charging plants and
                                        other life forms on Earth. As plants grow under
                                        the influence of the Sun's electric rays, they
                                        crystallize this energy within their structures,
                                        including fruits and vegetables.

When we consume these sun-ripened foods, we are effectively ingesting the stored
electricity. This electrical energy then aids the cells in performing their functions within
the body, contributing to overall health and vitality. Understanding and harnessing the
electrical energy present in natural foods underscores their importance in supporting
optimal bodily functions and well-being.

The same quantity of food you ingest ultimately exits your body. This observation hints
that sustenance isn't solely derived from the physical matter of solid food. Instead, it
implies that the inherent etheric vibrations and bioelctric charge within these foods play
a vital role in energizing and nourishing our cells.
              YOU NEED CHARGING
     YOU ARE A BIOLOGICAL ELECTROMAGNETIC BATTERY

The Earth itself generates its own electromagnetic field. The Earth's surface is also
electrically conductive, allowing it to carry electrical currents. When we ground
ourselves by connecting directly with the Earth, such as by walking barefoot on the
ground or touching natural surfaces, we may absorb some of this electromagnetic
energy. Some potential benefits of grounding our feet into the Earth include:

1. Reduced Inflammation: Grounding may help to reduce inflammation in the body by
   neutralizing excess free radicals and improving the balance of electrons.
2. Improved Sleep: Many people report experiencing better sleep quality and reduced
   insomnia after grounding. This may be due to the normalization of circadian
   rhythms and cortisol levels.
3. Pain Relief: Grounding has been associated with reduced pain and discomfort,
   potentially by modulating the body's perception of pain and promoting relaxation.
4. Stress Reduction: Grounding may help to reduce stress and anxiety by promoting
   feelings of calmness and relaxation. It may also help to regulate the body's stress
   response.
5. Enhanced Mood: Some individuals report feeling happier and more emotionally
   balanced after grounding, possibly due to the release of endorphins and other feel-
   good neurotransmitters.
6. Improved Energy Levels: Grounding may help to increase energy levels and reduce
   fatigue by restoring the body's natural balance and promoting better circulation.
7. Enhanced Immune Function: Preliminary research suggests that grounding may
   have immune-modulating effects, potentially helping to strengthen the body's
   immune response.

                INFLAMATION BEFORE               INFLAMATION AFTER




In the images above, you can see the comparison between before and after a 30-
minute grounding session. Following 30 minutes of grounding, the surface charge of
Red Blood Cells (RBCs) elevates. This phenomenon leads to a decrease in blood
viscosity, rendering the blood more fluid. Consequently, the heart expends less effort,
leading to improved circulation and potentially decreasing the risk of cardiovascular
issues. Not only have their cells improved, but as demonstrated in the images, it is
evident that after 30 minutes of grounding, the inflammation in the individual's back
has significantly decreased.

Making grounding a daily ritual is crucial for optimizing our health. I suggest that we
aim to ground for at least 10 minutes daily; however, the more time we can dedicate to
it, the better. This exercise can easily be incorporated early in the morning to start the
day off on the right foot.

Grounding our beds can indeed have significant health benefits. If you wish to do this,
you can purchase metal-laced bed sheets. Once you have them, you can use copper
wire to connect the wires to the metal-wired sheets, ensuring continuous grounding for
your bed. This practice can contribute to improved sleep quality, reduced
inflammation, and overall well-being.
                            GROUNDING
                                            Rubber is not a conductor of electricity and
                                            does not allow energy to transfer through it
                                            very well. Rubber-soled shoes were designed
                                            to insulate and disconnect us from the Earth,
                                            preventing the flow of electrical energy
                                            between our bodies and the ground. This
                                            insulation prevents grounding or earthing,
                                            which may have health implications as it
                                            disrupts the natural exchange of electrons
                                            between our bodies and the Earth's surface.


If you prefer not to walk barefoot all the time, you can still experience the benefits of
grounding by using natural materials in your footwear. Wooden shoes or shoes with
metal components can allow electric energy to transfer from the Earth to your body,
enabling grounding even while wearing shoes. This way, you can still connect with the
Earth's energy and reap the associated health benefits.




HUMN ENERGY FIELD
Grounding is indeed another excellent method to
strengthen your electromagnetic field. The human
energy field acts as a protective shield against energy-
borne diseases and sickness. When this field becomes
depleted, the body becomes more vulnerable to
diseases and health issues. Therefore, practices like
grounding, which enhance the body's electromagnetic
balance, can significantly contribute to overall well-
being and resilience against illness.

When we compromise the electromagnetic fields of our
cells, we contribute to our susceptibility to illness. This
weakening has ramifications on the broader scale of
our human energy field. Lowering the vibrational
frequency and diminishing our electromagnetic fields,
often through the consumption of acidic foods, aligns
us with the frequency associated with illnesses.
Diseases are thought to exist within a lower frequency
band, and when we harmonize with that frequency,

                           can result in the oil becoming highly refined and containing
                           harmful substances.
SUGAR
Sugar triggers the brain's reward system, leading to the release of dopamine, which
creates feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. This is a key factor in why sugar can be
addictive, with some researchers likening its addictive potential to that of cocaine.
Sugar often appears in ingredient lists under various names like glucose, corn syrup,
and artificial sweeteners. Excessive consumption of artificial sugars is linked to
numerous health issues, including diseases, tooth decay, and potential brain damage.
Thus, it's crucial to minimize or eliminate artificial sugars from our diets to promote
overall health and well-being.
                                FASTING

Fasting involves refraining from eating, providing the body
with an opportunity to address any internal issues. By diverting
energy away from digestion, the body can focus on healing
processes. Digestion requires a significant amount of the body's
energy. When we refrain from eating, this energy is freed up
and can be redirected to other bodily processes, potentially
aiding in healing and repair.

 During fasting, the body may generate stem cells, which possess the remarkable
capability to transform into specialized cells needed for tissue repair and regeneration.
Stem cells are undifferentiated cells with the remarkable ability to develop into various
specialized cell types in the body. They have the potential to differentiate into specific
cell types, such as muscle cells, nerve cells, or blood cells, depending on the body's
needs. Stem cells play a crucial role in the body's natural healing and regeneration
processes




TYPES OF FASTING:
Liquid only fast - During a water fast, individuals abstain from consuming all food and
only consume water for a designated period of time. This practice allows autophagy
(the process of cellular repair and regeneration) and the production of stem cells.
A liquid fast is often viewed as an effective method to cleanse the colon and clear the
digestive system of toxins and residual food. By consuming only liquids such as water,
herbal teas, fruit juices, and vegetable juices, the digestive system gets a break from
processing solid foods, allowing it to rest, flush and detoxify. This practice to helps
remove buildup and promote digestive health.

Dry fast - Dry fasting, is a practice where individuals refrain from consuming any food
or liquids for a designated period. Advocates of dry fasting often suggest that it can
lead to more profound detoxification effects compared to water fasting alone. The
body may efficiently eliminate toxins and waste products through various
physiological processes during a dry fast. Warning - Dry fasting, due to its extreme
detoxification and potential risks, should only be attempted by individuals who are
well-informed, experienced with fasting practices.
                               FASTING
HOW LONG DO I FAST FOR?
Starting gradually with shorter fasting durations, such as 1-2 days at a time, allows
beginners to acclimate to the experience and observe how their bodies respond. As
individuals gain more experience and confidence with fasting, they may choose to
extend their fasting periods, with experienced fasters potentially fasting for up to a
week. For those who are highly experienced and knowledgeable about fasting, longer
durations, such as one month or more, may be feasible.



HOW OFTEN SHOULD I FAST?
Giving the body a break from digestion every two weeks when initially starting fasting
can be beneficial. As you gain more experience with fasting, it becomes increasingly
advantageous to incorporate it more frequently into your routine. For instance, I
personally fast for at least 1 to 2 days every week to maintain my fasting practice and
its associated benefits.

    BLOOD & SKIN CONNECTION
The presence of skin conditions such as acne, rashes, and various dermatological issues
often serves as a visible indicator of underlying internal health imbalances. While
external supplements and topical treatments can sometimes provide temporary relief
by masking redness or irritation, they often fail to address the root cause of the
problem, which lies within the body.

As the body's largest organ, the skin reflects the overall health of our bloodstream and
internal systems. Skin issues like eczema and persistent rashes can be signals that our
blood may contain toxins or that our body's detoxification processes may be
compromised.

In essence, these skin manifestations act as outward manifestations of internal
disruptions. Therefore, merely treating the symptoms externally may not fully resolve
the underlying issues. Instead, adopting a holistic approach that includes dietary
adjustments, lifestyle modifications, and detoxification protocols is crucial for
addressing the root causes of skin conditions and restoring overall health and balance.



                       DO YOU HAVE TOXIC BLOOD?
To determine whether your blood is
toxic or clean, you can conduct a
simple test on yourself or someone
else. Pinch the middle topside of your
forearm. If the skin feels very thick
and not very stretchy, it may indicate
that your blood is thick and full of
toxins. On the other hand, if your skin
feels thin and elastic, it suggests that
your blood is purer and healthier.


                        HOW TO CLNESE THE BLOOD
To cleanse the blood effectively, it's beneficial to incorporate a variety of red alkaline
fruits and vegetables into your diet. These include strawberries, cherries, tomatoes,
raspberries, and others. These foods provide essential nutrients that support blood
health and aid in removing toxins from the bloodstream. By consuming a diet rich in
these red alkaline fruits and vegetables, you can help your body maintain optimal
blood health and detoxification. Additionally, it's beneficial to include foods and herbal
teas in your diet that are rich in iron fluorine. Herbs like burdock root, dandelion,
sarsaparilla, and cayenne pepper.
             IMPORTANCE OF IRON
 Iron is indeed one of the most important minerals for the body. Iron is a crucial
component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells responsible for transporting
oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and many other bodily functions. In the
bloodstream, iron is bound to hemoglobin and helps carry oxygen throughout the
body's tissues and organs. This oxygenation process is essential for cellular respiration
and overall bodily function.

Iron deficiency occurs when the body doesn't have enough iron to produce
hemoglobin, leading to a decreased ability to carry oxygen to tissues and organs. This
condition can result from various factors, including inadequate dietary intake of iron-
rich foods, poor absorption of iron in the digestive tract, blood loss (such as from
menstruation or internal bleeding), or increased demand for iron (such as during
pregnancy or rapid growth periods in children). Females need to pay particular
attention to their iron intake, especially around menstruation, because they lose iron
during this time through blood loss. Menstrual blood contains iron, and women who
have heavy or prolonged periods may experience greater iron loss

                                      Insufficient iron intake can indeed lead to various
                                      health issues and complications. Iron deficiency

                                      can result in a condition called anemia, which
                                      occurs when the body doesn't have enough
                                      healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to tissues
                                      throughout the body. This can lead to symptoms
                                      such as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath,
                                      dizziness, pale skin, and difficulty concentrating.

                       IRON FLOURINE
IRON is crucial for our respiration and overall bodily function, essentially serving as the
essence of life itself. Without iron, the production of red blood cells, responsible for
carrying oxygen throughout our bodies, would be impossible. Oxygen is essential for
every cellular process, providing the energy necessary for various bodily functions.
Furthermore, blood plays a vital role in eliminating metabolic waste generated
through respiration by transporting carbon dioxide, a byproduct of metabolism, to the
lungs for expulsion from the body. Hence, the supply of oxygen to cells and the
removal of carbon dioxide are paramount.

FLOURINE has been found to positively impact the formation of bones and teeth. It
contributes to strengthening immunity, fortifying bones, and safeguarding teeth. It's
worth noting that the healing properties attributed to natural fluorine differ from
those of chemical sodium fluoride found in water. Fluorine also aids in protecting the
body against viral invasion and proliferation. It acts as a disinfectant, germicide,
antiseptic, antiparasitic, and fever-reducing agent, further underscoring its beneficial
effects.


                               AVOID FAKE IRON
                                  Not all forms of iron are beneficial or absorbable by
                                  the body. Our cells require iron in the form of iron
                                  phosphate or iron fluorine, which is naturally found in
                                  plants, fruits, and vegetables, rather than synthesized
                                  in a lab. The iron listed in ingredients is often iron
                                  oxide, a physical form of iron. However, our cells
                                  cannot effectively absorb heavy metals like iron oxide,
                                  and it can potentially cause harm to the body. Our
                                  bodies are designed to absorb nutrients from natural
                                  sources created by nature, rather than synthetic
                                  compounds.


Iron fluoride is a compound created by combining iron and fluorine, forming an
inorganic substance. This will not benifit your body.

It's advisable to avoid iron supplements and foods containing added iron, as this iron is
often synthetic. Opt instead for natural sources of iron found in plants, fruits, and
vegetables, which provide the beneficial form of iron that the body can utilize
effectively.

A superfood is a term used to describe a food that is particularly rich in nutrients,
including vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other beneficial compounds.

The color of the fruit determines the health benefits it holds for the body. Red fruit
indicates that it is healthy for the blood and contains a high amount of iron. Green
fruit, for example, key limes, has detoxifying effects on the body and is beneficial for
detoxing the gut and colon. Orange fruit, such as seeded oranges, is beneficial for
cleansing the body of leftover waste.

Certain fruits bear a resemblance to the body parts they benefit, reflecting the idea
that nature provides foods tailored for human health. This suggests that fruits, herbs,
and plants are intricately designed by nature to promote our wellbeing, enabling us to
identify the foods that support our needs.Furthermore, this observation supports the
notion of a divine creation, where everything is interconnected—a microcosm within
the macrocosm. It suggests a profound unity and purpose in nature, where the
intricate design of fruits aligning with specific body parts reflects a deeper harmony in
the universe.
                  ORGANIC VS GMO
GMO, which stands for genetically modified organisms, refers to fruits and
vegetables that have undergone genetic alteration to serve commercial interests
or human preferences. Supermarket fruits, for instance, are often genetically
modified to prolong shelf life and facilitate mass production. While advantageous
for businesses, these modifications do not align with our body’s optimal health.

GMOs typically contain fewer minerals and nutrients compared to naturally
occurring foods. Hence, it's crucial to prioritize sourcing organic food whenever
feasible. Anything synthesized in a lab and not derived from nature's processes
may not be suitable for consumption. Our bodies are inherently part of nature,
and ideally, we should only consume what nature has provided for us since the
beginning."


              THE TERM ORGANIC HAS BEEN HIJACKED
The term "organic" is often misunderstood or misused in today's world. Organic
produce refers to fruits and vegetables grown without synthetic pesticides,
fertilizers or ionizing radiation. It's important to clarify that foods like broccoli,
carrots, or kiwi are not inherently organic because they are cultivated hybrids.
Instead, "organic" typically refers to the environment in which the food was
grown. This includes factors like uncontaminated soil and the absence of
pesticides. However, it's crucial to understand that just because a food is labeled
organic, it doesn't automatically mean it's healthy or nutritious.

The term "organic" is now being applied to deceased animals within the meat
industry. However, it's important to recognize that it's impossible to have organic
chicken flesh or organic chicken eggs because these products are derived from
sentient beings and are not suitable as food for our bodies.
           BOWEL MOVEMENTS


  It's essential to sit in the correct position during a bowel movement to ensure

          HOT VS COLD SHOWERS
Water is the element that cleanses and revitalizes all things in its presence. It has a
profound impact on our bodies and bodily systems, underscoring the importance
of using healthy water with minimal toxins.

Investing in a water filtering shower head can be highly beneficial for maintaining
healthier skin by reducing exposure to toxins present in tap water. These shower
heads typically utilize filtration systems to remove impurities such as chlorine,
heavy metals, and other contaminants, providing cleaner water for bathing. By
filtering out these substances, water filtering shower heads help minimize skin
irritation, dryness, and potential long-term effects on health.

Our skin, composed of trillions of pores, absorbs the water we apply to it. The
body reacts differently to hot and cold water: Cold showers or bathes can help
boost the immune system, responsible for combating diseases and toxins, while
hot showers have a soothing effect on the body, beneficial for muscle healing and
overall relaxation.

I personally advocate for cold showers as a routine practice, as they offer
numerous benefits for overall health. Over time, regular cold showers can lead to
deeper breathing, a lowered heart rate, a strengthened immune system, and
slower aging, among other advantages. Beyond physical benefits, cold showers
also provide mental advantages. Our nervous system naturally seeks pleasure
and safety, and by choosing to expose ourselves to cold environments, we
cultivate mental discipline and enhance the higher faculties of our minds. This
mental resilience can positively impact all aspects of our lives, contributing to
greater well-being and success.

PARASITES
                              PARASITES
Parasites are organisms that live in or on another organism (the host) and benefit
at the host's expense. They derive nourishment and other resources from the host,
often causing harm or discomfort to the host in the process. Parasites typically do
not enter the body externally. Instead, they are believed to emerge from within
due to factors such as consuming toxic foods and creating an acidic environment
within the body.

Some parasites have developed complex mechanisms to manipulate the behavior
of their hosts, including sending signals that can influence the host's brain. This
phenomenon is known as "parasite-induced behavioral manipulation." For
instance, certain parasites can alter neurotransmitter levels or produce molecules
that mimic those produced by the host's body, affecting the host's behavior in
ways that benefit the parasite's survival and reproduction. These behavioral
changes can range from increased risk-taking behavior to altering the host's
responses to predators or altering mating behaviors, all of which can enhance the
parasite's chances of transmission to new hosts.

Food cravings can sometimes be influenced by parasites, but they're not always
the sole cause. When the human body is healthy and the individual's mental and
emotional states are balanced, cravings can be minimized. In such cases,
individuals tend to prioritize nourishing foods that benefit their overall well-
being, focusing on what supports their body, mental discipline, and spiritual
harmony rather than solely indulging taste buds.

If you encounter or exhibit any of these four signs, there's a significant likelihood that
you have parasitic life forms residing within your body, and it's imperative to expel
them as swiftly as possible.
                           PARASITES
                      HOW TO REMOVE PRASITES
Parasites thrive in acidic based environments and feed off waste and acidic foods
in the body. To eliminate parasites, deprive them of their food source by
maintaining an alkaline diet and minimizing toxic foods. This can be achieved by
cutting out acidic foods and focusing on consuming alkaline fruits and herbs
recommended in this book. I advise avoiding grains and bread and opt for
cleansing foods to make the environment inhospitable for parasites. Over time,
consuming alkaline fruits and herbs may lead to parasites exiting the body
through bowel movements or, in severe cases, causing sickness and exiting the
body through the mouth.

Parasites exhibit intelligence in their survival tactics. Merely expelling them from
your body doesn't guarantee you're free of them. Before dying or exiting,
parasites often lay eggs to ensure their offspring's continuation within your body.
Therefore, it's crucial to maintain a fruit-only diet and herbal intake for up to two
months to prevent these eggs from hatching and establishing new generations
within your body.

                   PARASITE CLEANSING FOODS




   CLOVE              CINNAMON              GINGER             PUMPKIN SEEDS
                    BRAIN & THE GUT
                             CLEANSE YOUR GUT


                       The enteric nervous system that regulates our gut is often called
                       the body's “second brain.” Although it can't compose poetry or
                       solve equations, this extensive network uses the same
                       chemicals and cells as the brain to help us digest and to alert
                       the brain when something is amiss. Essentially, the gut serves
                       as a secondary intelligence, communicating vital messages such
                       as hunger cues or feelings of satiety.


This is precisely why consuming food that is past its expiration date or ingesting toxic
substances can lead to feelings of sickness or illness. When such substances enter our
digestive system, the enteric nervous system, acting as our "second brain," detects the
threat and alerts the primary brain. This triggers a response that can manifest as
symptoms of illness, serving as a protective mechanism to prevent further harm to the
body.

Remarkably, around 80% of our immune system resides in the gut. Additionally,
approximately 90% of serotonin, a neurotransmitter crucial for mood regulation and
other functions, is produced in the gut rather than the brain. Furthermore, nearly 50%
of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with reward and motivation, is
synthesized in the gut lining. These findings underscore the profound influence of the
gut on our overall well-being. Emerging research continues to highlight the strong
correlation between gut microbiota and various health conditions, including
autoimmune diseases, autism, and cancer. Every disease has been connected to the gut
microbiome to some extent. Understanding and nurturing the gut microbiome may
thus hold significant promise for both preventing and managing a range of health
challenges.

Maintaining a healthy body involves periodic gut cleansing, recommended at least
once every two months. This is necessary because undigested food residues in the body
can ferment and potentially attract parasites. Therefore, it's important to dedicate at
least one week out of every two months to consuming raw fruits and drinking ample
water, aiming for approximately 3.5 liters per day. Liquids play a vital role in
cleansing the body by effectively flushing out any remaining food residues.
Incorporating cleansing foods into your diet and integrating fasting can further
enhance gut cleansing and promote overall well-being.
                                   VISION
Poor vision is indeed prevalent in today's world. When experiencing poor vision in one
or both eyes, it often indicates inefficiencies in the muscles surrounding the eyes and
inadequate light intake. Wearing prescription glasses in such cases can exacerbate the
issue. This is because the weakened muscles may become accustomed to relying on the
glasses, leading to further relaxation and deterioration of vision over time. It's crucial
to address underlying muscle weakness and light intake issues through alternative
methods rather than solely relying on glasses for correction.



Instead of relying solely on glasses, addressing the root cause of poor vision is
essential. Here are some tips to help improve vision naturally:

1. Start by adopting a fruit-only diet and fasting one day a week. Consuming plenty
   of brain-boosting foods like blueberries can support overall eye health.
2. Grounding daily and sun gazing at sunrise or sunset can be beneficial. Sun gazing
   during periods of lower light can help train the eyes to intake more light,
   potentially improving vision over time.
3. focusing on a single point, such as a pen, and moving it around your visual field
   without moving your head, only your eyes. Concentrate intently on the pen,
   striving to make it as clear and sharp as possible.

By incorporating these practices into your routine, you can work towards improving
your vision naturally and addressing the underlying causes of poor eyesight.


                                          TRY THIS EXERCISE
                       If you're experiencing poor vision, try this straightforward
                       technique to test whether your eyes are receiving enough light.
                       Create a small opening with your hand, allowing only a tiny bit
                       of light to enter. Cover your eye completely with your hand,
                       ensuring that no additional light can enter except through the
                       small hole. Now, look through this opening, and you may
                       notice that your vision becomes noticeably clearer or even
                       sharper than before.


This exercise demonstrates that your eyes may not be receiving enough light, which
can reduce contrast and impact vision. To improve light intake for your eyes, it's
beneficial to minimize exposure to blue light from sources like light bulbs, TV screens,
and phones. Instead, prioritize getting more direct sunlight to stimulate the retinas
and enhance visual clarity. By reducing blue light exposure and increasing sunlight
exposure, you can support better contrast and overall eye health.
        HOW TO IMPROVE VISION




               SUN            AVOID              EYE              LIQUID
              GAZING         SEED OILS         EXERCISE          ONLY FAST



Poor vision could potentially indicate an accumulation of excess mucus in the head
region. To address this issue, consider incorporating herbal teas such as mullein leaf
into your routine. Additionally, thoroughly washing your head, scalp, face, ears, and
under the eyes with sea moss gel or a non-chemical face wash can help remove excess
mucus and promote clearer vision. These practices may contribute to improved eye
health and overall well-being.




                  ONE EYE WEAKER THAN THE OTHER
If you have one eye with poorer vision compared to the other, this discrepancy can be
addressed. The brain naturally prioritizes the use of the stronger eye, similar to how it
favors the stronger arm for certain tasks. Over time, this preference can lead to the
weaker eye becoming progressively weaker. However, it's possible to address this
imbalance and strengthen the weaker eye through targeted exercises and therapies.
By engaging in vision training techniques and consistently practicing activities that
specifically stimulate the weaker eye, you can help restore balance and improve vision
in both eyes.

Wearing an eyepatch over the stronger eye can indeed be a beneficial method for
strengthening the weaker eye. By covering the stronger eye, the brain is forced to
allocate more energy and attention to the weaker eye, leading to improved muscle
strength over time. It's common to experience tension or aching behind the eye after
engaging in eye exercises. This discomfort is a positive sign, indicating that the eye
muscle is being challenged and exercised. Similar to the soreness felt after a workout
at the gym, this discomfort signifies that the muscle is undergoing repair and
strengthening. With consistent practice and patience, these exercises can help enhance
the strength and function of the weaker eye.
                        HOW TO HEAL
             HEALING IS NOT AN OVERNIGHT PROCESS

If I were to encounter any issues with my body, my first course of action would be
to address the colon and gut by adopting a diet consisting solely of one type of
fruit. My preferred fruits for this purpose would be those rich in minerals, such as
blueberries or watermelon. This dietary choice aims to eliminate mucus, excess
food residues, and electrically charge my cells while providing essential nutrients
to my body.

Additionally, I would complement this fruit-based diet with herbal teas like
burdock root and dandelion root, known for their ability to break down mucus
and strengthen the immune system. After following this regimen for two weeks
and ensuring my body is in optimal condition, I would transition to a liquid-only
fast. During this fast, which could last up to four days, I would consume herbal
teas of my choice and juices from fruits like watermelon, key lime, and grapes.

Throughout this process, I would ensure to ground my feet in the earth for at least
30 minutes a day, aiming for more whenever feasible, while also maximizing my
exposure to direct sunlight.

Fasting allows the body to generate new stem cells for repair and utilize the
energy saved from the inactive digestive system to address any bodily issues.
Upon completing the fast, I would revert to the same diet and repeat the process
until my body is cleansed and fully recovered from the underlying health concern.


                     HEALING DOES NOT OCCUR OVER NIGHT
It's crucial to understand that healing isn't a sprint; it's more akin to a slow and
steady jog. Achieving healing requires discipline, consistency, and maintaining a
positive mindset throughout the process. Although it may seem challenging at
times, the long-term benefits make it all worthwhile. Many health issues are not
sudden occurrences but rather result from years of neglecting our well-being.
Often, unhealthy dietary choices, such as consuming junk food and acidic foods,
gradually manifest into various health problems. Thus, it's essential to recognize
the role of lifestyle habits in the development of diseases and commit to making
positive changes for better health outcomes.


Disease is essentially 'dis-ease' within the body, signifying that something is out of
balance or discomfort exists within the body's systems.

             CONSUME FOODS IN A SPECIFIC SEQUENCE
If you choose not to follow the advice on consuming only alkaline foods, I strongly
recommend adhering to this guidance on the order of food consumption. When faced
with a meal containing various types of foods, it's beneficial to eat them in a specific
order to support our digestive system and minimize glucose spikes. For optimal
digestion, start by consuming foods that digest quickly, such as fruits and vegetables.
Next, include proteins and fats in your meal, followed by starches and sugars last. I
advise avoiding foods with starch and the consumption of animal flesh for overall
health. Nevertheless, if you choose to consume these foods, it's advisable to follow the
recommended order of consumption outlined above

Similarly, this principle applies throughout our daily eating cycle. For our first meal of
the day, it's beneficial to consume easily digestible foods like fruits. These foods help
cleanse the system and minimize the energy expended by our bodies, ensuring we
have ample energy for the day ahead. As the day progresses, if you choose to consume
denser foods, it's advisable to do so later in the daytime. This approach supports
optimal digestion and energy utilization throughout the day.




                        BREAKFAST IS BREAK-FAST
The term "breakfast" originates from "breaking the fast," subtly influencing our
subconscious. However, it's worth noting that morning time is when the body
undergoes significant detoxification processes. Therefore, refraining from eating
during the morning hours aligns with supporting the body's detox efforts.

During sleep, the body undergoes a significant detoxification process. Upon waking,
there's a crucial four-hour window where the body detoxes most efficiently. To
optimize our health, it's recommended to refrain from eating until three to four hours
after waking up. By doing so, we can leverage our body's natural defense mechanisms
for enhanced well-being.
                 SEMEN RETENTION
Semen is the essence of masculinity, possessing the remarkable power to initiate
the creation of a new human being. This sacred fluid holds profound significance
and should be preserved within the body whenever possible. Despite its
composition rich in testosterone and other essential nutrients, the true strength of
semen is resides in its spiritual counterpart. The energy associated with semen is
profoundly potent, which explains why men often experience feelings of depletion
and lethargy after ejaculation. Thus, conserving semen is encouraged to harness
and channel this powerful energy for spiritual and personal growth in all aspect
of life

                    BENIFITS OF SEMEN RETENTION




       CLEARER      INCREASE        BOOSTS          MENTAL       MORE
        VISION      STRENGTH     TESTOSTRONE       DISCIPLIN    ENERGY




          MENTAL        GLOWING        STRONGER           STRONG
          CLARITY         SKIN       IMMUNE SYSTEM       MOTIVATION

Releasing semen can lead to a decrease in testosterone levels and an increase in
estrogen levels in men, potentially contributing to a more feminine physiological
balance over time. Over-ejaculation can lead to reduced energy levels, slower
muscle growth, accelerated aging, diminished self-confidence, and a lower
vibrational state.

The most powerful of all human emotions is the sexual desire. While there are
various mental stimulants, none of them, whether alone or combined, can rival
the overwhelming force of sexual desire. Sexual desire has the capacity to
completely dominate our body, mind, and spirit.

When sexual desire is redirected towards activities beyond mere physical actions,
such as intellectual or creative pursuits, it holds the potential to elevate an
individual to a genius level. In essence, channeling this potent energy into other
aspects of life can lead to remarkable achievements and enhanced abilities.
                             MENTALISM
The mind is something that cannot be described so easily. it is important that you
understand that the mind is not the brain; the brain is a physical manifestation of the
mind. The mind is not visible to the two eyes. the mind transcends time, space, and
matter; in other words, it exists outside of the physical world that is bound by space and
time. everything we see in the physical world is an effect generated by the cause of the
mind for example every car, building and design you see is a physical manifesation of
the designers mind. the mind is infinate and unmeserable as it has no boundaries and
limitations unlike the external physical world. anything is possible in the mind.

The universe is one giant mind with unlimited potential, information and generation. all
life forms including bugs and animals are sharing one thing in common whcich is that we
all posses mind. we are all expressing this one consciousness no matter what body it
enhabits. with that being the mental plane is a shared plane between everyone and
everything within the universe. take for example when i speak to you verbally it effects
you, tHe words that i say have an effect on your mind.

The mind isn't merely a generator of thoughts; rather, it acts as a receiver, tapping into
the universal mind. Depending on the frequency we tune our minds into, we receive
corresponding information. For instance, focusing on health directs our mental reception
toward thoughts and insights related to well-being. This is why we refer to it as a
"mindset" – we're essentially aligning our minds with specific frequencies.

Your life, the individuals within it, and the possessions you possess are direct reflections
of your past mental thoughts. With this understanding, the unseen aspects of your being
shape your tangible reality. You are the architect of your own existence, crafting your
own unique "you-niverse. Before kicking a football, a decision is first formulated within
the mind. Every action originates as a mental process before it manifests physically.

                             MENTALISM
            CONSCIOUS AND THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND

The subconscious mind represents the vast majority, about 90%, of our cognitive
processing capacity, encompassing memories, learned behaviors, emotional
associations, and crucially, mental frameworks known as paradigms. Operating
beneath the surface of conscious awareness, it serves as the repository from which we
draw upon past experiences and knowledge, effortlessly guiding our actions and
expressions.

This hidden realm exerts a profound influence on 80% of our daily behaviors, largely
through the ingrained mental programs stored within it. Consider routine tasks like
tying shoelaces or entering a phone passcode—these are executed automatically,
orchestrated by the subconscious mind without active conscious intervention.
Therefore, if we create a mental program, such as believing in financial freedom, it will
subconsciously influence 80% of our thinking patterns. For example, our thoughts will
revolve around creating financial freedom, and we'll naturally take actions aligned
with this goal, often without realizing it. Over time, this subconscious focus will lead to
manifesting our desires into physical reality.

Emotional events, particularly those of significant intensity, leave enduring imprints on
our subconscious, shaping our ongoing behaviors. For instance, a past car accident
resulting in severe injury may engender deep-seated fear, perpetuating a
subconscious program that manifests as hesitation or avoidance regarding automobile
travel.

However, the subconscious is not solely a domain of negative influence; it can be
harnessed positively. Through repetitive thought and emotional engagement,
individuals can intentionally cultivate new mental programs. By consistently
envisioning desired outcomes with emotional intensity, these programs take root
within the subconscious, subsequently informing the majority of our daily behaviors
and thoughts.

Crucially, the subconscious interprets all input literally, regarding it as truth. Thus,
every statement, whether positive or negative, is internalized as fact. For example,
self-deprecating remarks like "you're an idiot" are absorbed by the subconscious as
self-directed criticism, shaping one's self-perception accordingly.

To leverage the power of the subconscious in creating positive mental programs, it's
essential to understand this literal interpretation and employ conscious effort in
affirming desired beliefs and attitudes. By consistently impressing positive thoughts
and emotions upon the subconscious, individuals can shape their behaviors and
experiences in alignment with their aspirations.
