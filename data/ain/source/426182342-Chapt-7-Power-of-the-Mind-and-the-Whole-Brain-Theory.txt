THE POWER OF THE MIND:
 THE WHOLE BRAIN THEORY
What is the Whole Brain Theory?
 Scientists, medical doctors, psychologists,
 and psychiatrists have always been
 fascinated with the brain and how it works.
 Studies conducted on the brain often
 starts with the attempt to understand a
 brain-related disease or malfunction
 On the upcoming slides, several people
 that contributed to the studying of the
 mind…
                                          Paul Broca
                             In 1861, he conducted a study on the
                           language and left-right brain specialization.
                           He theorized that some language functions
                              reside on the left side of the brain by
                             running several tests to a patient with
                                        language problems.

           Dr. Roger Sperry
   Theorized the “Split-Brain Theory”.
    Explained that the brain has two
    hemispheres that performs tasks
    different from each other
      o Left Hemisphere
           Performs tasks that are intuitive,
             creative and synthesizing
      o Right Hemisphere
           Adept with reasoning, analytical,
             logical, and critical thinking.
     DR. PAUL MACLEAN

•Identified three distinct parts of the brain,
namely:

     Neocortex (Rational Brain)
       Responsible for intellectual tasks such as
        language, planning, abstraction, and perception
     Limbic System (Intermediate Brain)
       Responsible for motivation and emotion
        involved in feeding, reproductive behavior, and
        parental behavior
     Reptilian Complex (Primitive Brain)
       Controls self preservation and aggressive
        behavior of humans similar to the survival
        instincts of animals.


•Refers this theory as “The Triume Brain
Theory”
              NED HERRMANN
•   Engineer at the company of General Electric.

• Theorized  the “Brain Dominance Theory” which he
derived from his observations and tests that the
human body, although symmetrical and paired in
almost all aspects, do not necessarily function equally.
People normally have a more dominant part of their
body which they prefer to use. Hence, there is a
thing as a stronger arm, leg or etc. where the weaker
supports the stronger pair.

• He also concluded to having not just two parts but
four, the upper left and right hemispheres and the
lower left and right hemispheres of the brain.

•He is regarded as “Father of Brain Dominance
Technology”.
 The portions A and B are known as “left side brain thinking” and portions C and D
  are known as “right side brain thinking”.
 Based on Herrmann’s model, he developed the “Herrmann Brain Dominance
  Instrument (HBDI)” which is a 120-question survey instrument that will measure
  the preference strength of the four quadrants.
 Herrmann advocated for whole brain thinking, since most people utilize at least two
  primary quadrants. This means using one’s strength while allowing the weaker styles
  to grow stronger through regular use and practice. The real life application of this is
  in solving problems and taking a different approach to finding solutions through
  more creative problem solving

                   Quadrant A

     The Quadrant A learners are very much into logical thinking, they
      usually enjoy analyzing information and understand better when
      presented with numbers and quantities, they are also good at
      theorizing or concluding based on facts and information that support
      their theories. Quadrant A learners expect exact information that are
      straight to the point, and they would also want to be fed with lots of
      theories. However, these traits will cause them to find expressing their
      emotions and inner thoughts difficult, they may struggle with unclear
      or undefined concepts or ideas.
                Quadrant B

   The Quadrant B learners easily grasp things in sequence, enjoys
    organizing ideas and things, assess situations and information and apply
    what they have learned into practice. They are practical, demands clear
    instructions or directions, and needs to be able to see the sequence
    of things, which are consistent and proper order. Quadrant B learners
    finds understanding concepts difficult without any examples of its
    applications. Taking risks and doing things that are not clearly defined
    to them are their big challenges.

                                               Quadrant C

   The Quadrant C learners are very sociable. They enjoy learning with a
    group and are very focused and involved when trying to learn
    something. They get bored with intellectual discussions without
    activities and participation and also tend to reflect on what they have
    understood and acquired in terms of knowledge. The C learners are
    emotion and shares their emotions with a group. Personal feedback is
    important to them.
                    Quadrant D

   The Quadrant D learners are the curious ones who enjoy discovering,
    experimenting, and exploring activities. They are strong thinkers when
    it comes to conceptualizing and putting all the seemingly unrelated
    parts and connecting these parts together, synthesizing, and in creating
    new ideas and concepts. This type of learners enjoys games and
    surprises, a visual learner, and need different varieties of approaches to
    learning. They are spontaneous in character and usually have difficulty
    meeting deadlines and rigid environment.

                      NOTES
   The A & B learners, are often characterized as practical, reality-based, and down-to-earth
    persons
   The C & D learners are often characterized as fun, flexible, and open-minded persons
   Learners do not necessarily belong to just one or two quadrants, but can find their qualities
    present in all quadrants.
   Knowing the different styles of learning, the adolescent high school student or, We perhaps, can
    now easily adapt our own learning styles with that of our classmates and maybe even our
    teachers.
Organizing information and
concepts through the use of
maps and diagrams has been a
practice among thinkers and
using these diagrams have
been practiced for a long time
until the British author and
consultant Tony Buzan,
developed a technique in
creating such map, that was
popularized and known as the
“mind map”.
         THE MIND MAP




  A diagram used to represent ideas or information
  branching from a central key word or idea and used
  as an aid in study, organization, problem solving,
  decision making, and writing.
 Are useful during brainstorming sessions, organizing
  information, simplifying complex ideas, note-taking,
  and even for personal use.
5 Essential Characteristics of Mind Mapping




     1.   The center image represents the main idea,
          subject, or focus.
     2.   The main branches radiate from the central image.
     3.   The branches comprise a key image or word
          drawn or printed on its line.
     4.   Twigs represent the lesser topics
     5.   The branches form a connected model structure.
Using Mind Maps Effectively

  Use sing words or simple phrases
        In mind maps, single, strong words and short meaningful
         phrases can convey the same meaning more potently.
        Excess words just clutter the mind.


  Print words
          Joined up or indistinct writing is more difficult to read.


  Use color to separate different ideas
          Color helps to separate ideas where necessary, helps
           visualize the mind to recall and helps to show the
           organization of the subject.
 Use symbols and images
         Pictures can help you to remember information more
          effectively than words, so if a symbol or picture means
          something to you, use it.


 Use cross-linkages
         Information in one part of a mind map may relate to another
          part. Here, you can draw lines to show the cross-linkages.
          This helps you to see how one part of the subject affects the
          another.
