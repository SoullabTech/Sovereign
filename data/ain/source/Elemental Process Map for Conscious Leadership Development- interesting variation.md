Creating a process map that integrates the 12 facets of the Spiralogic process with the elemental framework to cultivate conscious leadership involves a detailed and holistic approach. 

  

Each facet and its functional relevance within an elemental context can guide a leader's journey toward becoming more self-aware, integrated, coherent, and dynamically evolving. 

  

Here is an overview of how these facets can be integrated into a leadership development process, aligned with the elemental cycle of Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and the addition of Aether as the unifying element:
