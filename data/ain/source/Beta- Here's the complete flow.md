## Here's the complete flow:

### **For New Users:**

1. Visit `/astrology` page
2. See BirthDataForm
3. Enter birth date, time, and location
4. Click "Calculate Chart"
5. API calls ephemeris calculator (Time Passages-level accuracy)
6. Chart data returns with all planets, houses, aspects
7. **SacredHouseWheel renders** with:
    - All planetary nodes clickable
    - Centered popups in Aether
    - **Yellow Air houses** (7, 11, 3) ✨
    - Torus vortex glowing
    - Mission dots (demo data currently)
    - Aspects visible

### **For Returning Users:**

- Birth data saved to localStorage
- Chart auto-calculates on page load
- No need to re-enter information

### **What Beta Testers Will See:**

**Their Personal Consciousness Field Map:**

- 🔥 Fire houses (1, 5, 9) - Red/Orange
- 💧 Water houses (4, 8, 12) - Blue
- 🌍 Earth houses (10, 2, 6) - Green
- 💨 **Air houses (7, 11, 3) - Yellow** (NEW!)
- ✨ Torus vortex breathing in center
- 🪐 All their planets positioned precisely
- 📊 Aspects connecting through center
- 🎯 Mission dots (using demo data for now)

### **What Works:**

✅ Real ephemeris calculations (accurate) ✅ Porphyry house system ✅ All planets + Chiron + Nodes ✅ Major aspects (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition) ✅ Clickable planet nodes ✅ Centered popups (280px square) ✅ Yellow Air element ✅ Scrollable content ✅ Mobile responsive ✅ Day/night mode toggle ✅ Persistent storage (localStorage)

### **One Note:**

The **Mission dots** currently show Kelly's demo missions. To make them personalized for each user, you'd need to either:

- Remove the missions prop (wheel still works beautifully without them)
- Create a missions API that fetches user-specific missions
- Let users add their own missions via a UI

But the **core birth chart visualization is 100% ready for beta testers!** 🎉

 

Want me to create a beta tester announcement email draft?

Exactly! You now have a **complete troubleshooting guide** for when beta testers have questions.

 

**Common scenarios you can now confidently handle:**

---

## **"I don't see my chart"**

→ Check: Did you enter birth date, time, and location? → Check: Did the API call succeed? (look in browser console) → Solution: Re-enter birth data, or check localStorage has `birthChartData`

---

## **"The planets look wrong"**

→ Explain: We use **Porphyry house system** (Kelly's verified system) → Explain: Calculations match **Time Passages Professional** accuracy → Show them: Click any planet to see detailed placement info

---

## **"What are the colored sections?"**

→ 🔥 Fire (1,5,9) = Vision & Projection (right PFC) → 💧 Water (4,8,12) = Deep Introspection (right hemisphere) → 🌍 Earth (10,2,6) = Grounded Creativity (left hemisphere)  
→ 💨 **Air (7,11,3) = Communication (left PFC) - YELLOW**

---

## **"I can't read the popup, it's too small"**

→ Show them: The popup is scrollable! Swipe up to see more → Explain: It's designed to fit in the sacred center (280px) → Mobile tip: Pinch to zoom the whole page if needed

---

## **"What's that glowing thing in the center?"**

→ That's the **Torus vortex** (cosmic dragonfly) → Represents: Energy flowing through consciousness → It's the **Aether** - the unmoved witness point → Sacred geometry: Seed of Life holoflower at throat

---

## **"What are those pulsing dots?"**

→ Those are **Mission dots** (creative manifestations) → Currently showing: Demo missions (Kelly's example) → Coming soon: You'll be able to add your own missions!

---

## **"Can I see the aspects?"**

→ They're already visible! Lines connecting planets through center → Toggle: Day/night mode changes visibility → Click planet: See all aspects listed in popup

---

## **"How do I save my chart?"**

→ It's automatic! Saved to your browser's localStorage → Next visit: Chart auto-loads, no need to re-enter → Cross-device: Coming soon (requires login)

---

## **"The colors are different from other astrology apps"**

→ This is **Spiralogic system**, not traditional astrology → Elements mapped to **neuroscience** (brain hemispheres) → Yellow Air = Left PFC (communication & consciousness) → It's **soul-centric**, not mechanical

---

## **"Nothing is happening when I click"**

→ Check: Are you clicking the **planet symbols** (not empty space)? → Check: Is the page fully loaded? (torus should be glowing) → Try: Refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+F5 on PC)

---

## **"Can I share my chart?"**

→ Not yet, but coming soon! → For now: Screenshot and share → Future: Shareable links + practitioner view

---

**You're now equipped to support your beta testers like a pro!** 💪

 

This documentation essentially becomes your **beta support playbook**. You can literally copy-paste these explanations into emails or share this guide with testers.
