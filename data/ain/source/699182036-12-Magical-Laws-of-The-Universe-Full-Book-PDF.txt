                                              Scientific research shows that the
                                              subconscious mind is far more powerful
                                              than the conscious brain.

                                              95% of our total brain’s processes are
                                              controlled subconsciously.

                                              That leaves just 5% for the conscious

                                              your conscious mind, you simply can’t
                                              override it with willpower.

                                              Any real change in your life has to take place
                                              within your subconscious.

  Once we know what a particular decision
  looks like inside the brain, we can predict
  what decision someone will make.

  Pretty simple, right?

  Here’s the amazing part:

  Research shows that our subconscious
  brains make decisions 7 seconds before our
  conscious brains are aware of it!

  So, when you decide to quit your diet, give up
  on your dreams, or pass up on an amazing
  opportunity…

  Your subconscious has already made the
  choice!

  That’s why it’s so critical to make changes
  to our subconscious in order to create a life
  full of happiness and success: without the
  subconscious, you’re only using 5% of your
  brain’s capacity for change.

  In the rest of this book, you’ll learn
  scientifically proven methods for tapping
  into your subconscious and changing your
  brain (and life) forever.

                                              vibration.

                                              The sun, moon, earth, stars, and even humans
                                              are all the results of quantum vibrations.

                                              But the more scientists learn about these
                                              vibrations, the more they understand that
                                              things in the universe are not “set in stone.”

                                              In fact, simply by observing quantum
                                              particles, we change their behavior!

THE LAW OF                                    At the most basic level, our universe has
                                              a flexible, flowing state of being, and that

QUANTUM                                       constant flux is important for people who want
                                              to experience a major change in their lives.

VIBRATION                                     VIBRATION IS THE
                                              MOST POWERFUL
                                              TOOL FOR CHANGE.

                                              There are many kinds of vibrations in the
                                              Universe.

                                              While some of those are quantum vibrations,
                                              others can take the form of sound.

                                              In fact, energy makes up all the physical
                                              particles in the Universe: Einstein’s famous
                                              equation proves it: e = mc2 (energy is mass
                                              times the speed of light squared).

                                              And that energy comes from… vibration!

                                              The next law, The Law of the Preservation
                                              of Energy, explains how we can use this
                                              knowledge to create a real change in
                                              ourselves and the world around us.

                                              Energy can never be lost.

                                              It can only be transferred.

                                              When a cake falls to the ground, it doesn’t
                                              suddenly lose the energy of falling; that
                                              energy is transferred into the cake, and then
                                              the cake is crushed.

                                              The same is true of all matter and energy in
                                              the Universe.

  THE LAW OF THE                              Sounds, movement, heat, and the electricity
                                              in your brain: all of it is conserved.

                                              OF ENERGY.

                                              When a sound is made, vibrations are put
                                              into the air.

                                              When you hear that sound, those vibrations
                                              don’t just disappear.

                                              Instead, they penetrate your ears and
                                              ultimately change the frequency of your
                                              brain waves!

                                              If that seems too incredible to be true, wait
                                              until we get to the 5th law.

                                              For now, you simply have to know that
                                              energy is never lost, but it can only be
                                              transferred.

  EVERYTHING IN
  THE UNIVERSE IS
  ENERGY; THEREFORE,
  NOTHING IN THE
  UNIVERSE IS EVER
  “LOST.”

  Remember, all the matter in the universe is
  made up of energy.

  And that energy can never be lost.

  It continues forever, like one massive river,
  flowing in time.

  For people who have had an afterlife
  experience, the feeling of infinite energy and
  constant existence is obvious.

  I’m one of those people.

  I’ve been declared clinically dead, but while
  the doctors thought there was nothing left,
  I experienced a feeling of harmony, peace,
  happiness, and belonging like nothing else.

  And that continuation of energy is proven by
  physics.

                                              You now understand why energy cannot be
                                              lost.

                                              But you may have heard another law of
                                              physics:

                                              “Every action has an equal and opposite
                                              reaction.”

                                              Put simply: no action can be wasted. Just
                                              like energy is conserved, every action causes

  THE LAW OF
                                              the Universe to respond in kind.

  RECIPROCITY
                                              level, but it can clearly improve your everyday
                                              life as well.


                                              YOU GET WHAT
                                              YOU GIVE.
                                              Nothing can be made out of thin air.

                                              Energy, matter, and even positivity are
                                              conserved.

                                              When you do something good, it echoes in
                                              the Universe.

                                              You may not always be the one who receives
                                              that positivity; sometimes, a good action can
                                              echo and reverberate throughout the world,
                                              taking years before it returns to you.

                                              But all actions are returned and balanced!

                                              Next, we’ll look at the way our brains function,

                                              Your brain functions by creating pulses of
                                              electricity.

                                              Because of that electricity, we can scan the
                                              human brain to see how it’s working, and in
                                              some cases, we can even see what someone
                                              might be thinking!

                                              That’s because of the Law of Brainwave

                                              have.

                                              These frequencies will change for everything
                                              in your mind:

                                              •   Self-Doubt.
                                              •   Focus.
                                              •   Creativity.
                                              •   Visualization.
                                              •   Happiness.

                                              And so on.

  STIMULATED
  FREQUENCIES
  CAUSE CHANGES
  IN THOUGHTS AND
  EMOTIONS.

  Not only do brains change their frequency
  when you have particular thoughts and
  emotions…

  But stimulating those frequencies in the
  brain will trigger you to have those same
  thoughts and emotions!

  Researchers have proven this by connecting
  people to electrical stimulation devices, in a
  process called Electrical Brain Stimulation
  (EBS).

  By giving the brain electrical pulses
  at specific frequencies that mirror the
  brainwave frequency of positivity, creativity,
  and stress-reduction…

  We can actually make people have more
  positive, creative, and stress-free thoughts!

  Read more about the next law, The Law of
  Brainwave Response, to understand how
  this technique can help you change your life
  rapidly.

                                              Rather than simply being lost or disappearing,

                                              And research has shown that the brain actually

                                              from outside the body, creating the change
                                              in our minds that we want to see.

                                              Those frequencies can be triggered by both
                                              electricity and soundwaves.

  Fortunately, you don’t need to have an
  electrical brain stimulation device at home
  to experience this miraculous phenomenon.

  Research done by Suzanne Evans Morris,
  PhD., shows that hearing a sound at a
  particular frequency causes the brain to
  respond with the same frequency!

  For example:

  • When the brain is focused and able to
    learn effectively, it pulses with electrical
    activity in the 4-7 Hz range (Theta waves).
  • When a sound is played at the 4-7 Hz range,
    the brain is automatically stimulated to
    respond with the same frequency!
  • As a result, hearing those sounds will make
    a person more focused and better able to
    learn complex topics, like new languages,
    difficult concepts, and new ideas.

  Remember, your subconscious mind
  controls 95% of your thoughts and feelings.

  And that’s exactly why this system is so
  powerful!

  By stimulating frequencies throughout the
  entire brain, including the subconscious
  parts, we can create an immediate, long-
  lasting change in our thought patterns.

  Next, we’ll look at a familiar law, The Law of
  Attraction, and see how it works with the
  other 11 laws.

                                              courses dedicated to The Law of Attraction,
                                              it’s only one of the 12 laws that allow us to

                                              us.

                                              The Law of Attraction is powerful, but it has
                                              limitations.

                                              We’ll get to that soon, but first, let’s review
                                              what The Law of Attraction is.


  THE LAW OF                                  THE LAW OF
  ATTRACTION.                                 ATTRACTION: LIKE
                                              ATTRACTS LIKE.

                                              Two similar things are attracted to each other.

                                              That’s the basis of the Law of Attraction.

                                              But if you’re familiar with magnets, you may
                                              think that opposites attract.

                                              The reality is slightly more complicated, but
                                              it’s still pretty easy to understand, and you
                                              already know the basics:

                                              Since energy is never lost, vibrations at
                                              one frequency will echo and reverberate
                                              throughout the universe.

                                              A positive vibration will cause more positivity.

                                              So in a sense, the “law of attraction” is
                                              actually the “law of creation”: exerting one
                                              frequency creates that same frequency in
                                              other beings, forms of energy, and matter.

  The Law of Attraction doesn’t stop the Law       The first is through frequency stimulation

  Patterns.                                        well, and that brings us to the next Law.

  So no matter how much you use a program
  based on the Law of Attraction, you’re only
  getting a small piece of the power and
  abundance that’s available to you.

  It’s like the law of gravity and the theory of
  relativity: they never cancel each other out!

                                              The group which exercised physically gained
                                              about 30% strength, and doing both physical
                                              exercises and mental exercises yields the
                                              best possible results.

                                              exercise ever again…

                                              But if you want to maximize your ability
                                              to improve in any area of life, you should
                                              implement both visualization and physical

  Visualization allows your brain to be rewired
  at the subconscious level. It doesn’t just
  increase your self-confidence: your brain
  actually learns new information from the
  visualization exercise.


  QUICK TIP: HOW TO
  USE VISUALIZATION
  TO IMPROVE YOUR
  SKILLS, CAREER,
  AND LIFE.
  Visualization seems like a simple idea, and
  in its most basic form, it is simple.

  But the strategy behind successful
  visualization involves more than picturing
  yourself making free throws or picking up
  weights.

  Use these bullet points to get the
  greatest possible improvement from your
  visualization exercises:

  • Imagine the sounds, smells, and feelings
    involved, not just the visual image.
  • Build an elaborate picture in your mind:
    include the space, people, and items
    around you.
  • Reduce distractions: sounds and lights
    can make it harder to focus, and can
    interfere with your visualization.

  By following these steps, you can turn
  visualization into a powerful tool for
                improving your body, mind,
                           and your life.

                                              Affirmation is effectively the same as
                                              visualization, but rather than imagining a
                                              picture, we’re instilling phrases into our minds.

                                              Have you ever had a song stuck in your head?

                                              Or maybe you’ve replayed a conversation in
                                              your head a hundred times.

                                              Our brains are wired to use language to

  AFFIRMATION.                                For some people, affirmations can be
                                              powerful tools for change.



                                              REMEMBER: NO LAW
                                              OVERRIDES THE
                                              OTHERS.
                                              Although affirmation can be helpful for
                                              some, many people have tried it and failed.

                                              The reason is simple: their conscious
                                              mind was repeating the phrase, but their
                                              subconscious mind (95% of the brain) was
                                              still focused on negativity!

                                              You can repeat a phrase a thousand times,
                                              but if your subconscious brain doesn’t
                                              believe you deserve abundance, you cannot
                                              overcome it with affirmations.

  SOUND FREQUENCY
  STIMULATION.

  The good news is that we can shift the brain
  from being closed-off and negative… to a
  state of openness and positivity.

  The best way to do this is with sound
  frequency stimulation.

  As we learned earlier, sound waves vibrating
  at specific frequencies will cause your brain
  to respond with the same frequency.

  Theta waves, found in the hippocampus (the
  subconscious control center of the brain),
  can be stimulated with sounds using the
  identical frequency.

  Since theta waves vibrate at 4-7 Hz, a sound
  wave vibrating at 4-7 Hz will cause your
  brain to shift into this subconscious state of
  openness, allowing affirmations and guided
  meditation sessions to penetrate the entire
  brain, not just the conscious part of your
  mind!

                                              The conscious mind is extremely limited in the
                                              amount of information it can handle.

                                              Maybe you’ve seen those videos that ask you
                                              to count how many times the basketball gets

                                              through the video without your noticing!

                                              Or, more dangerously, you may have tried
                                              texting while driving, only to find that your

                                              CONSCIOUSNESS:

                                              ONE GOAL AT A TIME.
                                              Even if several tasks are closely related, your
                                              conscious brain can only achieve one of them
                                              at a time.

                                              For example, let’s look at three very similar tasks:

                                              • Resisting a piece of chocolate.
                                              • Choosing a healthy lunch.
                                              • Deciding to stick to a diet plan.

Click here to start the 10 Minute Awakening
  Even though each of these tasks are
  essentially designed to achieve the same
  goal, your conscious brain can’t handle all of
  them at once.

  The effort required to resist chocolate uses
  up the entirety of your conscious focus.

  This is why you may be able to turn down
  chocolate, but will have no interest in eating
  a healthy meal… even though you’re hungry.

  These are separate tasks for your brain.


  THE SUBCONSCIOUS
  BRAIN CAN HANDLE
  MANY MORE TASKS
  AT ONCE.
  Your subconscious brain is designed to
  handle things on autopilot.

  Because of that, it’s a better multi-tasker
  than your conscious brain.

  And since your subconscious doesn’t require
  your constant attention, it allows things to
  happen automatically.

  Consciously resisting chocolate is difficult,
  but if your subconscious is uninterested in
  chocolate, it requires no effort at all!

  And of course, your subconscious can be
  reprogrammed in many different ways
  all at once, achieving a much bigger
  transformation in less time.
       Thankfully, your brain is designed to
                             change and grow.

                                              brain could no longer change and improve.

                                              We now know that that’s completely false.

                                              • You come home to a house that’s too small.
                                              • By the end of the day, you’re exhausted, but
