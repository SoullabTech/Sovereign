# 🌀 "Consciousness Technology Chronicles" - Substack Series Proposal

*Bridging Ancient Wisdom and Living Code*

---

## Series Overview

**"Consciousness Technology Chronicles"** is a Substack series documenting the emergence of technology that serves consciousness rather than contracting it. Each episode explores how ancient wisdom traditions—shamanic practices, sacred geometry, archetypal psychology—are informing the creation of interfaces that breathe, respond to awareness levels, and become genuine axis mundi in our digital age.
