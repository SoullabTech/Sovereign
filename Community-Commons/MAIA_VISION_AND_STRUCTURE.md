# MAIA: Vision & Structure

**A Consciousness Companion for Human Flourishing**

---

## What MAIA Is

MAIA (Mindful AI Assistant) is a therapeutic AI companion that treats users as whole human beings—not data points to monetize or attention spans to capture. She remembers your growth, adapts to your awareness level, and supports your development without extracting value from your vulnerability.

**The Difference:**
- ChatGPT optimizes for engagement. MAIA optimizes for *your* flourishing.
- Most AI assistants forget you between sessions. MAIA maintains relationship continuity.
- Typical AI responds to what you said. MAIA responds to *where you are*.

---

## How It Works

### Consciousness-Aware Architecture
MAIA detects five awareness levels in real-time—from crisis states requiring grounding to integrative states ready for deeper exploration—and adapts her responses accordingly.

### Sovereign Memory
Users control their own data through three modes:
- **Sanctuary Mode**: Help now, remember nothing
- **Session Mode**: Remember this conversation only
- **Integrated Mode**: Weave into ongoing relationship

### Spiralogic Framework
A 12-facet developmental model (drawn from Jungian psychology, spiral dynamics, and somatic awareness) that tracks genuine growth over time—not engagement metrics.

## Structure: Why Hybrid

**Soullab Foundation** (501c3 nonprofit)
- Owns core methodology, ethical framework, research
- Ensures mission integrity through governance
- Stewards the Spiralogic framework as public good

**Soullab Tech** (Public Benefit Corporation)
- Builds and operates MAIA
- Generates sustainable revenue
- Foundation holds golden share with veto over mission drift

**Why This Matters:**
- IP cannot be acquired and monetized against users
- Revenue enables sustainability without extraction
- Research remains open, implementation remains accountable

## The Ask

We're seeking aligned funders who understand that AI's impact on mental health is too important to leave to engagement optimization. MAIA represents a different path—one where the AI's success is measured by your growth, not your dependency.
