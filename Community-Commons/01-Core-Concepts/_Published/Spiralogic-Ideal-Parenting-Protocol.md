# Spiralogic Ideal Parenting Protocol (IPP)

## Essence

A clinical integration of Dan Brown & David Elliott's research-validated Ideal Parenting Protocol with Spiralogic elemental framework - using guided imagery and elemental archetypes to install internal secure caregivers and create earned secure attachment in adults.

## Description

The Spiralogic IPP represents a groundbreaking synthesis of attachment repair science with archetypal psychology. Dan Brown & David Elliott's original IPP uses guided imagery to install internal representations of ideal caregivers, reliably creating earned secure attachment in 50-60% of cases through neuroplastic memory reconsolidation.

Our integration maps the **14 functions of ideal parenting** to the **five elemental states**, creating a comprehensive framework for both personal attachment repair and conscious parenting development. This protocol goes beyond behavioral parenting techniques to literally rewire internal working models of relationship, safety, and self-worth.

**Clinical foundation:** The IPP is part of Brown & Elliott's Three Pillars Model for attachment repair, with measurable neurobiological effects including reduced limbic hyperreactivity, increased prefrontal regulation, and enhanced vagal tone.

## Alchemical Context

The protocol embodies the alchemical process of **Solve et Coagula** - dissolving insecure attachment patterns and reconstituting secure internal representations. It represents the **Rubedo** stage where individual healing creates the capacity for conscious relationship and parenting.

The five elemental ideal parents serve as archetypal containers for the complete spectrum of secure caregiving, creating internal **imago** that support lifelong emotional regulation, self-worth, and relational capacity.

### Clinical Implementation Protocol

#### **Phase 1: Elemental Assessment (Weeks 1-2)**
- Identify which elemental functions were missing in early development
- Assess current attachment style and specific deficits
- Map traumatic experiences to missing IPP functions
- Choose primary elemental focus based on greatest need

#### **Phase 2: Single Element Mastery (Weeks 3-8)**
- Begin with most needed element (often Earth for safety)
- Practice daily 15-minute guided imagery sessions
- Install one function per week within chosen element
- Build somatic capacity for receiving each function

#### **Phase 3: Elemental Integration (Weeks 9-16)**
- Gradually introduce additional elements
- Practice imagery combining multiple elemental parents
- Develop internal dialogue capacity with each archetypal parent
- Integrate functions across different life situations

#### **Phase 4: Embodied Integration (Weeks 17-24)**
- Practice accessing internal parents in daily life
- Apply IPP functions in current relationships
- Develop capacity to provide IPP functions to others
- Create earned secure attachment patterns

#### **Phase 5: Generational Healing (Ongoing)**
- Use internalized IPP to break intergenerational patterns

## Questions for Reflection

1. Which of the 14 IPP functions do I most need to install in my internal parent system?

2. How might my current attachment style be related to missing elemental functions from my early development?

3. What would change in my life if I had consistent access to all five archetypal parents?
