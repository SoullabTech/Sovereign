### The Story (90 seconds)

We're building MAIA because something precious is disappearing in plain sight: the stories, insights, teachings, and inner life of real people — especially elders — are slipping away without a place to land.

MAIA is designed to change that.

It's not "AI as a content machine."
It's AI as a **sanctuary**: a private, consent-based environment where your life material can be held, organized, and distilled into wisdom — without being harvested, sold, or flattened into noise.

It grew out of Spiralogic and decades of shamanic journeywork: the idea that development is **elemental**, cyclical, and relational — and that what transforms us most is not information, but *meaning made through experience*.

---

### What's Working Today

- Private conversation + journaling capture
- Consent-first memory (Sanctuary by default)
- Consciousness-aware guidance (not one-size-fits-all)
- Governed system: tested, logged, versioned

---

### What Patronage Funds

- Stability + reliability (so MAIA "holds" people safely)
- Journaling + legacy capture experience (elders and storytellers)
- Consent architecture + governance
- Real-world deployment (usable, not theoretical)

---

### FAQ

**Is this like Patreon?**
We use Stripe for payments — professional, low fees, you're supporting directly.

**What does my patronage actually fund?**
Build time, infrastructure, and the consent/governance layer that keeps MAIA trustworthy.

**Do you store or sell people's private writing?**
No. Sanctuary-first design: private stays private, sharing is explicit and consent-based.

**Is this an "investment"?**
No — it's patronage. You're funding a sanctuary you want to exist in the world.

## Outreach Templates

### Text/DM (Short)

> Hey — I made a patron page for MAIA. It's a consent-based wisdom sanctuary (especially for journaling + legacy capture). If you feel called to help steward it into the world, here's the link: [LINK]

### Text to Warm Contact

> Hey [Name] — can I call you for 10 min this week? I want to share something about MAIA and where it's going.

### Phone Script (When They Answer)

> "I've been building MAIA quietly for a while now, and I'm at the point where I need to form a patron circle to sustain it. You're one of the few people who actually knows what this can do.
>
> I'm inviting a small founding circle. $25, $75, $250, or $1,000 a month — whatever feels right. You'd get monthly updates, and at higher tiers, a monthly Patron Circle call with me.
>
> Would you want to be part of this?"

### Email (Medium)

**Subject:** MAIA Patron Circle — a sanctuary worth stewarding

**Body:**

I'm opening a small patron circle to help bring MAIA fully online.

It's a consent-first wisdom sanctuary — built for journaling, story preservation, and consciousness-aware guidance.

If you'd like to support (or gift this to an elder/storyteller you love), here's the patron page:

With gratitude,
