## Audit Process

### Step 1: Quick Scan (30 minutes per vault)

For each vault, answer:

**What themes appear repeatedly?**
-

**What notes feel "alive" and want to be shared?**
-

**What connects to Jung/Hillman/alchemy specifically?**
-

**What's purely private vs. potentially public?**
-

### Step 2: Tag Candidates

As you browse, mark notes with potential:
- `#commons-candidate` tag
- Or create `/To-Curate/` folder in each vault
- Or list them below

### Step 3: Transformation Plan

For each candidate note, ask:

1. **What's the essence?**
   - Can it become a concept card?
   - An essay?
   - A practice?
   - A dialogue/reflection?

2. **What needs anonymizing?**
   - Names, identifiable details
   - Private client/partner information
   - Internal team matters

3. **What's the Commons format?**
   - Concept card → `01-Core-Concepts/`
   - Essay → `02-Thematic-Essays/`
   - Practice → `04-Practices/`
   - Resource → `06-Resources/`

## Curation Workflow

Once you identify a note:

### Weekly Practice

**Monday Morning (30 min):**
1. Open one vault
2. Read 5-10 notes
3. Mark 1-3 as candidates
4. Add to audit table above

**Friday Afternoon (1-2 hours):**
1. Choose ONE candidate note
2. Transform it using appropriate template
3. Save to Community Commons
4. Mark as complete

**Monthly Review:**
- How many notes transformed this month?
- What themes are emerging?
- What's the living edge?

---

## Transformation Templates

### From Internal Note → Concept Card

1. **Read original note** twice
2. **Extract essence** - one sentence
3. **Expand description** - 2-4 paragraphs
4. **Add alchemical context** - how it fits
5. **Make practical** - how to use it
6. **Add questions** - for reflection
7. **Remove private details** - anonymize
8. **Use template:** `_Templates/Concept Card.md`

### From Internal Note → Essay

1. **Identify theme** across multiple notes
2. **Synthesize** into coherent narrative
3. **Add structure** - sections, flow
4. **Include multiple perspectives**
5. **Make it sing** - good writing matters
6. **Remove private details**
7. **Use template:** `_Templates/Essay.md`

### From Internal Note → Practice

1. **What's the actual method?**
2. **Make it step-by-step**
3. **Add context** - when to use
4. **Add cautions** - when not to
5. **Include your experience** - what you learned
6. **Use template:** `_Templates/Practice.md`

## Quick Wins - Start Here

**Easiest transformations:**

1. **Definitions/frameworks you've written**
   - Already structured
   - Just need formatting
   - Quick concept cards

2. **Practices you use**
   - You know them by heart
   - Just document them
   - Fast practice guides

3. **Beautiful reflections**
   - Pieces that sing
   - Maybe just light editing
   - Could be essays or dialogue

**Save complex work for later:**
- Notes that need heavy synthesis
- Topics requiring research
- Controversial or edgy material

## Tips for Sustainable Curation

### Do:
✓ Set regular times (Mon/Fri)
✓ Start small (one note per week)
✓ Follow your energy (work with what's alive)
✓ Trust your instincts (if it wants to be shared, it will show you)
✓ Celebrate progress (each transformation matters)

### Don't:
✗ Try to transform everything at once
✗ Force notes that don't want to be shared
✗ Perfectionism (done > perfect)
✗ Guilt about slow pace
✗ Skip the anonymization step

---

## The Question

Before transforming any note, ask:

**"Does this serve the soul of the commons?"**

If yes → transform it
If no → leave it be
If maybe → let it compost longer
