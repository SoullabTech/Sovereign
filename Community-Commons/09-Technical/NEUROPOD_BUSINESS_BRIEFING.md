## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Validation experiments fail (p > 0.05)** | Medium | Critical | Run pilot N=5 first, refine protocols, conservative hypotheses |
| **Adverse event rate >5%** | Low | Critical | Strict screening, conservative safety caps, real-time monitoring |
| **Low subscriber conversion (< 500 by Year 3)** | Medium | High | Free Foundation tier as acquisition funnel, strong community engagement |
| **Hardware supply chain delays** | Medium | Medium | Order components with 3-month lead time, maintain buffer inventory |
| **Reputational risk (associated with pseudoscience)** | Low | High | Transparent evidence stratification, reality-testing, conservative claims |
| **FDA regulatory challenges (if pursue medical route)** | Low | Medium | Consult regulatory experts Year 3, stay in "general wellness" category initially |
