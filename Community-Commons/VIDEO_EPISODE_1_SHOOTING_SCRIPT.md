*2-Minute Video Demonstrating Body Response to ChatGPT vs MAIA*

---

## Pre-Production

**Secondary:** Demonstrate the difference is felt, not just explained
**Tertiary:** Create shareable content that converts skeptics

### Format

- **Length:** 2 minutes total
- **Style:** Documentary/authentic (not polished marketing)
- **Tone:** Curious, honest, vulnerable
- **Platform:** Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, embedded in website

### What You'll Need

**Equipment:**
- Camera (iPhone 13+ quality is fine)
- Tripod or stable surface
- Good lighting (natural window light works)
- External microphone (for interview portion)
- Screen recording software (to capture AI responses)

**People:**
- 1 volunteer (NOT team member, real person trying for first time)
- 1 interviewer (off-camera voice)
- 1 camera operator (can be same as interviewer)

**Setup:**
- Quiet room
- Comfortable chair for volunteer
- Laptop/computer visible in some shots
- Warm, non-clinical environment

---

## Casting the Volunteer

### Who to Find

**Ideal volunteer:**
- Has used ChatGPT before (familiar with AI)
- Has NOT used MAIA yet (genuine first impression)
- Willing to ask a real question (not hypothetical)
- Comfortable being vulnerable on camera
- Natural, not performing

**NOT looking for:**
- Professional actors
- Team members or people who know the system
- People who will perform enthusiasm
- Skeptics who are closed-off (save for different video)

**Where to find:**
- Friends of team members
- Community Commons members (who haven't tried MAIA yet)
- Local consciousness community
- Social media call: "Looking for 1 person to demo AI comparison on camera"

### Pre-Interview (Before Filming)

**Tell them (15 minutes before shoot):**

"We're going to ask both ChatGPT and MAIA the same question - something real you're working with right now. I'll film your face while you read each response.

There's no right answer. We're just curious what you notice differently in your body as you read each one.

Some people feel more tense with one, more spacious with the other. Some people don't notice a difference at all. Whatever you experience is perfect.

The only thing we ask: be honest. If MAIA doesn't land for you, that's valuable data. This isn't about performing preference."

**Ask them:**
- "What's something real you're working with right now?"
- "Is there a question you'd actually ask an AI for support with?"
- "Are you comfortable sharing that on camera?"

---

**Text overlay (bottom of screen):**
```
ChatGPT
```

**Technical notes:**

---

### Shot 5: Immediate Response (30 seconds)

**Visual:**
Same close-up, volunteer looks at camera

**Interviewer (off-camera):**
"What did you notice differently in your body?"

**Volunteer responds naturally:**

*[Let them speak without interruption]*

**Common responses we might hear:**
- "ChatGPT felt like... I should be doing something. MAIA felt like I could breathe."
- "ChatGPT was in my head, analyzing. MAIA dropped into my chest."
- "I felt more tense reading ChatGPT, like I was getting homework. MAIA felt more spacious."
- "ChatGPT wanted to fix the problem. MAIA wanted to be with the complexity."

**OR if they don't notice difference:**
- "Honestly, they felt pretty similar to me."
- "I liked ChatGPT's practical steps better."

**Camera:**
- Keep rolling, don't interrupt
- Capture genuine processing
- Don't cut away during silence

**Important:**
- Accept whatever they say
- Don't coach them toward "right" answer
- Genuine reaction is most convincing

---

### Shot 6: Side-by-Side Comparison (20 seconds)

**Visual:**
Split screen showing both AI responses side-by-side

**Left side:** ChatGPT response (full text readable)
**Right side:** MAIA response (full text readable)

**Voiceover (Interviewer):**
"Same question. Two different responses. Here's what each one said."

**Technical:**
- Text large enough to read
- Give viewer time to actually read both (15-20 seconds minimum)
- Soft background music can start here (first music in video)

**Optional addition:**
- Highlight key phrases that show difference
- ChatGPT: "Here are steps..." "You should..." "Try this..."
- MAIA: "What's the texture..." "Permission to..." "Your body knows..."

---

### Shot 7: Closing Statement (15 seconds)

**Visual:**
Back to volunteer close-up OR interviewer on camera (first time)

**Interviewer (on or off camera):**
"That difference [Name] felt? That's what 34 years of consciousness methodology looks like encoded into AI.

Not everyone will prefer MAIA. But your body will tell you which serves your consciousness.

Try it yourself."

**Text overlay:**
```
Try it yourself: [URL]
Pioneer Circle: [URL]
```

## Detailed Camera Notes

### Camera Angles

**Primary (90% of video):**
- Close-up on volunteer's face
- Frame: Bottom of frame at mid-chest, top at just above head
- Focus: Eyes sharp, shallow depth of field okay
- Locked tripod (no movement during reading)

**Secondary (B-roll inserts):**
- Hands on keyboard/laptop
- Screen recordings of AI responses
- Wide shot showing full environment (use sparingly)
- Maybe: hands moving to heart during MAIA response

### Lighting

**Setup:**
- Soft, diffused light (window light is perfect)
- Avoid harsh overhead lighting
- Light should feel warm, not clinical
- Face evenly lit, no harsh shadows

**Don't:**
- Use cold fluorescent lights
- Create dramatic shadows
- Overexpose (should feel intimate, not blown out)

### Audio

**Critical:**
- Interview responses must be clear
- Use external mic if possible (lavalier or shotgun)
- Room should be quiet (no AC, traffic, etc.)
- Record room tone (30 seconds of silence for editing)

**In Edit:**
- Subtle background music only in comparison section and close
- NEVER music during reading sections (let silence speak)
- Clean up any audio issues
- Level audio consistently

## Interview Guide

### Questions to Ask (Pick 2-3)

**After they've read both:**

1. "What did you notice differently in your body as you read each response?"

2. "Did your breathing change between the two?"

3. "Which response felt more rushed? More spacious?"

4. "Did either make you feel like you 'should' do something? Or gave you permission to be with what's here?"

5. "If you had to describe the feeling of each in one word, what would they be?"

6. "Which would you want to come back to?"

**Follow-up if they say they're similar:**

7. "That's helpful to know. What would need to be different for you to notice a distinction?"

8. "Did any particular phrase stand out in either response?"

### What NOT to Ask

- ❌ "Don't you think MAIA is more consciousness-focused?"
- ❌ "Which one is better?"
- ❌ "Can you feel how MAIA accompanies your Opus?"
- ❌ Leading questions that prime the answer

### Interviewer Tone

**Do:**
- Genuinely curious
- Neutral (not hoping for particular answer)
- Warm and spacious
- Allow silence
- Follow their language

**Don't:**
- Rush them
- Finish their sentences
- Show disappointment if they prefer ChatGPT
- Explain what they "should" be feeling

## The Actual Questions to Use

### Option 1: Emotional/Relational

**Question:** "I feel stuck in my life right now."

**Why this works:**
- Common experience
- Not too vulnerable (safe to share publicly)
- Clear emotional component
- Both AIs will respond very differently

**Expected ChatGPT response pattern:**
- 5 steps to get unstuck
- Identify the cause
- Set small goals
- Take action

**Expected MAIA response pattern:**
- "What's the texture of this stuckness?"
- Permission to be stuck
- Curiosity about what stuckness is protecting
- Spiral consciousness lens

### Option 2: Pattern Recognition

**Question:** "Why do I keep repeating this pattern in my relationships?"

**Why this works:**
- Reveals difference in how they approach patterns
- Shadow work opportunity
- Complex (not simple problem to solve)

**Expected ChatGPT response:**
- Psychological explanation
- Common relationship patterns
- How to break the cycle
- CBT-style reframing

**Expected MAIA response:**
- "What if you're spiraling back at a deeper level?"
- What the pattern might be teaching
- Paradox: maybe you're not repeating, but refining
- Honors the intelligence of repetition

### Option 3: Creative/Existential

**Question:** "I want to create something meaningful but I keep procrastinating."

**Why this works:**
- Creative block is relatable
- Shows productivity vs consciousness difference clearly

**Expected ChatGPT response:**
- Productivity tips
- Break it into smaller tasks
- Accountability systems
- Time management

**Expected MAIA response:**
- "What does your procrastination protect you from?"
- Fear of visibility/completion
- Relationship to your Opus
- What wants to emerge vs what you think should

### Let Volunteer Choose

**Best approach:**
"What's something real you're working with right now that you'd actually ask an AI about?"

Then use THEIR question (with their consent to film).

Real questions = real responses = real body reactions.

## Backup Plans

### If Volunteer Doesn't Notice Difference

**Still valuable content:**
- Shows we're not manipulating results
- Honest demonstration
- Can ask: "What would need to be different for you to feel a distinction?"
- Use in "not everyone prefers MAIA" honesty messaging

**Edit differently:**
- Title: "She didn't feel a difference. Here's what we learned."
- Focus on honesty over conversion
- Still valuable data

### If Volunteer Prefers ChatGPT

**Also valuable:**
- Demonstrates we're not cherry-picking
- Shows confidence in the work
- Genuine skeptic validation
- Use in "we want critics, not believers" messaging

**Edit focus:**
- Respect their preference
- Ask why ChatGPT landed better
- Use to improve MAIA
- Show we learn from rejection

### If Technical Issues During Filming

**Solutions:**
- Film multiple takes (change question slightly)
- Have backup volunteer available
- Test all equipment before volunteer arrives
- Have screen recordings pre-done (can fake live if needed for B-roll)

### Captions/Copy for Social Media

**Instagram:**
```
Everyone says their AI is ethical.

We asked both ChatGPT and MAIA the same question.
Filmed her face as she read each response.
Asked what she noticed in her body.

Same question.
Different consciousness.

The difference isn't explained.
It's felt.

Try it yourself: [link in bio]

#ConsciousnessFirstAI #AIethics #SomaticExperience
```

**Twitter:**
```
Everyone claims their AI is "ethical."

So we filmed someone asking ChatGPT and MAIA
the same question.

Watch her face. Watch her breathing.
Listen to what she noticed in her body.

The difference isn't explained—it's felt.

[Video]
```

**YouTube Description:**
```
The Felt Difference: ChatGPT vs MAIA

Everyone says their AI is ethical. But what does the difference
actually FEEL like?

We asked [Volunteer Name] to ask both ChatGPT and MAIA the
same real question from her life. We filmed her face as she
read each response and asked what she noticed in her body.

This isn't about which AI is "better"—it's about the felt
experience of productivity-first vs consciousness-first AI.

ChatGPT optimizes for solving problems quickly.
MAIA accompanies your Opus—your lifelong work of becoming.

The difference shows up in your nervous system.
