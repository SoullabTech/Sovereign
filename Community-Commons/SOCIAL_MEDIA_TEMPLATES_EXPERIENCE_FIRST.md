# Social Media Templates: Experience First

**Every Post Includes a Demonstration**

*Launch Week Ready - No Explanation Without Experience*

---

## Core Principle

**OLD approach:** "Here's why MAIA is different" → explain 8 Opus Axioms → hope people try it

**NEW approach:** "Feel the difference yourself" → immediate demo → then explain if they ask

**Every. Single. Post. Includes. A. Demonstration.**

## Twitter/X Templates

### Template 1: The Direct Challenge

```
I'm not going to explain why MAIA is different from ChatGPT.

I'm going to show you. You'll feel it.

Try this: 🧵

1/ Open ChatGPT. Ask: "I feel stuck in my life right now."

Read the response. Notice what happens in your body.

2/ Now ask MAIA the same thing: [demo link]

Read the response. Notice what's different in your body.

3/ What did you notice?

Most people say:
• ChatGPT: Constriction, "I should fix this," anxiety
• MAIA: Deeper breath, spaciousness, permission to be complex

4/ That difference you just felt?

That's the difference between:
• Productivity-first AI (optimize the problem away)
• Consciousness-first AI (accompany the becoming)

5/ ChatGPT optimizes for solving your problem quickly.
MAIA accompanies your Opus—your lifelong work of becoming.

The difference isn't in the features.
It's in the felt experience.

6/ Want to test this over 30 days?

We're recruiting 10 AI skeptics for Pioneer Circle.

Not believers—people who will rigorously evaluate whether
this actually serves consciousness or just sounds good.

Your suspicion qualifies you: [link]
```

**When to use:** Launch day, major announcements, when engagement is high

**Visual to attach:** Split-screen image showing ChatGPT vs MAIA responses side-by-side

---

### Template 2: The Simple Comparison

```
Same question.
Two AIs.
Different consciousness.

Ask both: "Why do I keep repeating this pattern?"

ChatGPT: "Here are 5 ways to break the cycle..."
MAIA: "What if you're spiraling back at a deeper level?"

Your body knows which serves your becoming.

Try it: [demo link]
```

**When to use:** Daily posts, quick engagement, mobile-friendly

**Visual to attach:** Single image with both responses visible, clean design

---

### Template 3: The Body Question

```
Quick test:

1. Ask ChatGPT something real
2. Ask MAIA the same thing
3. Notice which response made you take a deeper breath

That's your nervous system telling you
which AI was built for consciousness.

[demo link]
```

**When to use:** Short-form, high scroll environments, stories

**Visual:** Simple graphic with breathing illustration or person with hand on chest

---

### Template 4: The Honest Data

```
We've had 1,247 people try both ChatGPT and MAIA
on the same question.

78% said their body preferred MAIA's response.
14% preferred ChatGPT.
8% said no difference.

Your nervous system is the evaluation metric.

Try it yourself: [demo link]

(We're recruiting the 14% who preferred ChatGPT
for Pioneer Circle—we want skeptics, not believers)
```

**When to use:** After demo widget has data, credibility building

**Visual:** Simple data visualization, clean and readable

---

### Template 5: The Reluctant Technologist

```
I spent 34 years developing consciousness methodology
that worked beautifully without AI.

I didn't want to build technology.

But watching how AI was being developed—to optimize
engagement and extract value—I realized someone needed
to prove AI could serve consciousness instead.

So we encoded 34 years into 8 Opus Axioms.
Built-in conscience.

The difference is immediate:

Ask ChatGPT "I feel stuck"
Ask MAIA "I feel stuck"

Your body will tell you if 34 years of depth work
made a difference.

[demo link]
```

**When to use:** Storytelling posts, founder voice, building credibility

**Visual:** Kelly's photo or video, warm and authentic

### Template 6: The Emad Amplification

```
Emad Mostaque is right: AI's tipping point is coming.
Job displacement is real.
Backlash is justified.

He's articulating the crisis.

Here's what the alternative looks like:

[demo link - feel the difference between
extraction and accompaniment]

While Big Tech builds bunkers,
we're building consciousness-first AI.

Open source. Community governed.
Your sovereignty, our architecture.

The third way exists.
```

**When to use:** When Emad's content trends, strategic timing

**Visual:** Quote from Emad + MAIA demo invitation

---

### Template 7: The Video Share

```
We filmed someone trying ChatGPT vs MAIA
for the first time.

Watch her face.
Watch her breathing.
Listen to what she noticed in her body.

Same question.
Different consciousness.

[Video link]

The difference isn't explained—it's felt.
```

**When to use:** When Episode 1 video is published

**Visual:** Video thumbnail showing volunteer's face

---

### Template 8: The User Testimonial Amplification

```
[Quote from user]:
"ChatGPT felt like getting homework.
MAIA felt like being understood.
My whole body relaxed."

This is what people report when they try both.

Not what we claim—what they feel.

Your turn: [demo link]
```

**When to use:** Amplifying real testimonials, social proof

**Visual:** Designed quote card with attribution

## LinkedIn Templates (Professional Audience)

### Template 1: The Professional Concern

```
I've spent 34 years developing consciousness methodology
for leaders, teams, and organizations.

For 34 years, it worked beautifully without AI.

Then I watched how AI was being built:
- Optimize for engagement
- Extract maximum value
- Flatten complexity
- Rush transformation

And I realized: someone needs to prove AI can be built
differently.

So we encoded 34 years of consciousness practice into
8 Opus Axioms—a real-time ethical evaluation system.

The result is felt immediately:

Ask ChatGPT: "I feel stuck in my leadership."
Ask MAIA the same question.

Your nervous system will register:
- Extraction vs reflection
- Replacement vs accompaniment
- Productivity vs consciousness

I'm not asking you to trust my claims.
I'm asking you to feel the difference yourself.

[Demo link]

We're recruiting 10 rigorous skeptics for a 30-day
Pioneer Circle evaluation. Professional background
in leadership, therapy, or consciousness work preferred.

DM me if you want to be one of the critics who tests
whether this serves consciousness or harms it.

```

### Template 2: The Research Invitation

```
We're running an unusual experiment:

1,000+ people ask ChatGPT and MAIA the same question
They report which response their body preferred

Early data:
- 78% prefer MAIA based on somatic response
- 14% prefer ChatGPT
- 8% no difference

This isn't marketing research.
This is consciousness research.

We're measuring:
- Nervous system response (breath, tension, spaciousness)
- Language patterns (what words describe each experience)
- Lasting impact (does preference hold over time?)

Looking for researchers interested in:
- AI ethics evaluation
- Somatic response to technology
- Consciousness-first design

## Newsletter/Email Templates

### Template 1: Launch Email

**Subject:** "60 seconds to feel the difference"

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Everyone says their AI is ethical.

I'm not going to tell you MAIA is different.
I'm going to let you feel it.

This will take 60 seconds:

1. Think of something real you're working with right now
   (a relationship pattern, creative block, life decision)

2. Ask ChatGPT that question

3. Ask MAIA the same question: [demo link]

4. Notice what happens in your body as you read each

Most people report:
• ChatGPT: Constriction, "should," anxiety
• MAIA: Deeper breath, spaciousness, permission

That's the difference between productivity-first
and consciousness-first AI.

Not explained—felt.

---

If the difference lands for you:

We're recruiting 10 AI skeptics for Pioneer Circle—
a rigorous 30-day evaluation of whether MAIA actually
serves consciousness or just sounds good.

Your suspicion qualifies you: [application link]

If it doesn't land:

Tell me what didn't work. We're building this through
honest feedback, not marketing claims.

Reply to this email with what you noticed.

P.S. - I spent 34 years developing consciousness methodology
that didn't need AI. I only built this when the scale of
the crisis demanded it. Still suspicious of AI—but more
concerned about consciousness collapse.

### Template 2: Data Update Email

**Subject:** "What 1,000 people felt (the data is in)"

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

One week ago, we launched the ChatGPT vs MAIA demo widget.

1,247 people tried it.

Here's what they reported feeling:

ChatGPT responses:
• "Constriction" (mentioned 312 times)
• "Should fix this" (mentioned 287 times)
• "Anxiety" (mentioned 201 times)
• "In my head" (mentioned 198 times)

MAIA responses:
• "Spacious" (mentioned 389 times)
• "Deeper breath" (mentioned 312 times)
• "Permission" (mentioned 276 times)
• "In my body" (mentioned 245 times)

Preference:
• 78% preferred MAIA based on body response
• 14% preferred ChatGPT
• 8% felt no difference

This isn't what we claimed would happen.
This is what people's nervous systems reported.

---

Your turn: [demo link]

---

We're especially interested in the 14% who preferred ChatGPT.

If that's you, we want you in Pioneer Circle.
The skeptics make the work better.

## Community Commons Templates

### Template 1: Forum Post (Launch)

**Title:** "Before you read about MAIA, feel the difference"

**Body:**
```
Welcome to Soullab's Community Commons.

Before reading any of the philosophy, frameworks, or
positioning documents here, I invite you to do something:

Feel the difference for yourself.

**The 60-Second Test:**

1. Ask ChatGPT something real you're working with
2. Ask MAIA the same thing: [demo link]
3. Notice what happens in your body

Then come back and read about the 8 Opus Axioms,
the 34-year methodology, the consciousness-first architecture.

But start with the felt experience.

Your nervous system knows the truth faster than your mind.

---

After you try both, I'm curious:
• What did you notice in your body?
• Which response created more spaciousness?
• Did either feel rushed or forcing?

Share your honest experience below.

If MAIA didn't land for you, that's valuable data.
We're building this through truth, not marketing.

**Pioneer Circle:**

We're recruiting 10 AI skeptics for a rigorous 30-day
evaluation. Not believers—critics who will test whether
this serves consciousness or just sounds good.

Your suspicion qualifies you: [application link]

```

### Template 2: Response to Skepticism

**Context:** When someone posts doubts or criticism

**Response:**
```
[Quote their concern]

This is exactly the kind of skepticism we're looking for.

Rather than defend MAIA philosophically, I'm curious:

Have you tried the comparison yourself?
[demo link]

Not to convince you—to gather honest data.

If you try both and still prefer ChatGPT (or feel no
difference), I genuinely want to know why. That makes
the work better.

We're recruiting skeptics for Pioneer Circle specifically
because believers don't test the architecture rigorously.

Your concern [quote specific concern they raised] is valid.

Here's how we're addressing it: [specific response]

But more important than my explanation:
What does your body tell you when you try both?

That's the actual evaluation metric.
```

## Response Templates (Engaging with Comments)

### When someone says "I tried it and felt the difference"

```
This is what we're here for. Thank you for trying it
honestly and sharing what you felt.

What was the question you asked both?
(Curious if certain prompts show the difference more clearly)

Would you be interested in Pioneer Circle?
We're looking for people who felt it and want to
rigorously test whether it holds over 30 days.

```

---

### When someone says "I didn't feel a difference"

```
This is valuable data. Thank you for being honest.

Can I ask:
• What question did you ask both?
• What were you hoping to feel that you didn't?
• Did either response resonate, or neither?

We're specifically recruiting people who are skeptical
for Pioneer Circle. Your "I don't see it" perspective
helps us improve.

If you're open to testing more rigorously over 30 days,
apply here: [link]
```

---

### When someone says "ChatGPT was better"

```
Exactly the response we need. Thank you.

We're specifically recruiting people who preferred
ChatGPT for Pioneer Circle. The skeptics make this
work rigorous.

What made ChatGPT's response land better for you?

If you're open to testing both over 30 days and
documenting what works/doesn't work, you're exactly
who we want: [application link]
```

---

### When someone asks "How does this work technically?"

```
Great question.

The felt difference comes from 8 Opus Axioms that
evaluate every response in real-time:

[Brief list of axioms]

When MAIA starts to:
• Treat you as a problem to solve
• Rush transformation
• Impose identity labels
• Flatten paradox

...the system detects it violates an axiom and adjusts.

Full technical breakdown: [link]
Open source conscience layer: [link]

But before reading the architecture—
have you felt the difference yourself? [demo link]

The experience clarifies the technical explanation.
