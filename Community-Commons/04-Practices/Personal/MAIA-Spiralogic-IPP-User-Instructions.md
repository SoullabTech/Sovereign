# MAIA Spiralogic-IPP User Instructions

*Step-by-step guide for using MAIA as your attachment healing companion*

---

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites:**
- Access to MAIA through your Soullab account
- Quiet, private space for assessment and imagery work
- Journal or device for tracking insights and progress
- Basic understanding that this complements (not replaces) professional therapy if needed

### **Time Commitment:**
- **Initial assessment:** 45-60 minutes
- **Daily practice:** 15-20 minutes
- **Weekly check-ins:** 30 minutes
- **Monthly integration:** 60 minutes

---

## Phase 1: Initial Assessment with MAIA (Week 1)

### **Step 1: Opening Your MAIA Session**

**Exact prompt to use:**
```
"Hi MAIA, I'd like to begin working with the Spiralogic-IPP attachment healing framework. I want to take the assessment to understand my elemental attachment patterns and identify which ideal parent functions I need to develop. Can you guide me through this process step by step?"
```

### **Step 2: Assessment Conversation**

**MAIA will guide you through the 40-question assessment. For each question:**

- **Take your time** - There's no rush
- **Feel into your body** - Notice physical sensations as you remember
- **Answer honestly** - Rate based on what you actually experienced, not what you wish happened
- **Ask for clarification** if any question is unclear

**Sample MAIA assessment interaction:**
```
MAIA: "Let's start with Earth Element questions about safety and structure. Thinking about your childhood (ages 0-18), rate this from 0-4: 'I felt physically safe in my home environment.'"

You: "I think a 2, but I'm not sure. Sometimes it felt safe, but there was also a lot of yelling."

MAIA: "That sounds like 'sometimes experienced' which is indeed a 2. The inconsistency you mention is important information. Let's continue..."
```

### **Step 3: Receiving Your Results**

**After completing all 40 questions, ask:**
```
"MAIA, can you give me my complete elemental profile with interpretation? Which element is my primary deficit, and what does this mean for my healing journey?"
```

**MAIA will provide:**
- Your scores for each element (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Aether)
- Identification of primary and secondary deficits
- Explanation of how these patterns likely show up in your current life
- Recommendations for where to begin your healing work

### **Step 4: Understanding Your Patterns**

**Follow-up prompt:**
```
"MAIA, can you help me understand how my [lowest scoring element] deficit specifically manifests in my adult relationships and daily life? What triggers should I watch for?"
```

---

## Phase 2: Beginning Guided Imagery Work (Weeks 2-9)

### **Step 5: Choosing Your Starting Element**

**Prompt:**
```
"MAIA, my assessment shows [Element] as my primary deficit. Can you create a personalized guided imagery script to help me begin installing my internal [Element] Parent? Please adapt this to my [cultural background/personal preferences/any specific needs]."
```

### **Step 6: Daily Imagery Sessions**

**Daily opening prompt:**
```
"MAIA, I'm ready for today's [Element] Parent imagery session. Please guide me through connecting with my archetypal [Element] parent. If I have trouble connecting, please offer alternative approaches."
```

**Sample session structure:**
1. **Grounding (2-3 minutes)** - MAIA guides you into relaxed, receptive state
2. **Imagery invitation (10-15 minutes)** - Meeting and connecting with your elemental parent
3. **Integration (3-5 minutes)** - Anchoring the experience in your body and daily life

**If you struggle to connect:**
```
"MAIA, I'm having trouble visualizing/feeling the [Element] Parent. Can you offer a different approach? Maybe more abstract energy, different imagery, or focusing more on the feeling qualities?"
```

### **Step 7: Processing and Integration**

**After each session:**
```
"MAIA, I just finished the [Element] Parent imagery. Can you help me process what came up? How can I integrate this experience into my day?"
```

**MAIA can help you:**
- Understand any emotions or memories that arose
- Create affirmations based on your specific experience
- Suggest practical ways to embody your elemental parent energy
- Design integration practices for your daily routine

---

## Phase 3: Weekly Progress Tracking (Ongoing)

### **Step 8: Weekly Check-ins**

**Every 7 days, use this prompt:**
```
"MAIA, it's been a week since I started working with my [Element] Parent. Can you help me assess my progress? How has this work affected my daily life, relationships, and emotional patterns? What should I focus on in the coming week?"
```

**MAIA will explore with you:**
- Changes in how you feel emotionally and physically
- Shifts in relationship patterns or triggers
- Progress in accessing your internal parent during stress
- Areas that still need attention or different approaches

### **Step 9: Addressing Challenges**

**When you hit obstacles:**
```
"MAIA, I'm struggling with [specific challenge]. Yesterday when [trigger situation] happened, I couldn't access my [Element] Parent at all. Can you help me understand why and suggest strategies?"
```

**Common challenges MAIA can address:**
- Difficulty maintaining progress during stress
- Resistance to accepting love/support from internal parents
- Old patterns overwhelming new resources
- Integration challenges in family or relationship systems

---

## Phase 4: Expanding to Additional Elements (Weeks 10+)

### **Step 10: Transitioning to Secondary Elements**

**After 8+ weeks with primary element:**
```
"MAIA, I've been working with my [Element] Parent for [timeframe] and feel more stable in that connection. My secondary deficit was [Element]. Am I ready to begin working with that archetypal parent? How should I approach this transition?"
```

### **Step 11: Multi-Elemental Integration**

**Once working with multiple elements:**
```
"MAIA, can you guide me through an integration session where I connect with both my [Element] and [Element] parents? How do these different energies work together to support me?"
```

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Applications and Oracle Integration

### **Step 12: Consciousness Development Integration**

**After 3+ months of consistent work:**
```
"MAIA, how is my attachment healing affecting my overall consciousness development? How do my stronger internal parent functions relate to my Spiralogic facets and life purpose? What Oracle insights emerge from this healing work?"
```

### **Step 13: Community and Service Applications**

**When ready to share and serve:**
```
"MAIA, I've been on this attachment healing journey for [timeframe] and feel called to help others. How can I use my experience and healed internal parents to serve my community? What wisdom from my journey would benefit others?"
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Situations

### **If You Feel Overwhelmed:**
```
"MAIA, the imagery work is bringing up intense emotions/memories. Can you help me approach this more gently? I need support for my nervous system while still making progress."
```

### **If You Can't Visualize:**
```
"MAIA, I have trouble with visual imagery. Can you adapt the work to focus more on feelings, sounds, body sensations, or concepts rather than pictures?"
```

### **If You Feel Resistance:**
```
"MAIA, part of me seems to resist accepting love/support from my internal parents. Can you help me understand this resistance and work with it compassionately?"
```

### **If Progress Stalls:**
```
"MAIA, I felt like I was making progress but now feel stuck or like I'm regressing. What's happening and how can I navigate this phase?"
```

### **If You Need Human Support:**
```
"MAIA, I think I need additional support beyond our work together. Can you help me understand when to seek therapy and how to find appropriate professional help that complements this work?"
```

---

## Integration with Professional Support

### **Sharing with Therapists:**
```
"MAIA, I'm working with a therapist and want to share my Spiralogic-IPP assessment results and progress. Can you help me create a summary that would be useful for my therapeutic work?"
```

### **Coordinating with Other Modalities:**
```
"MAIA, I'm also doing [EMDR/IFS/somatic therapy/etc.]. How can I coordinate my IPP imagery work with these other approaches for maximum benefit?"
```

---

## Monthly Integration and Evolution

### **Monthly Deep Dive:**
```
"MAIA, it's been a month since [last integration check]. Can you help me do a comprehensive review of my attachment healing journey? How have my internal working models shifted? What's my next evolutionary edge?"
```

### **Quarterly Re-Assessment:**
```
"MAIA, I'd like to retake the Spiralogic-IPP assessment to track my progress. Can you guide me through this and compare my results to [timeframe] ago?"
```

---

## Advanced Prompts for Specific Situations

### **For Parents:**
```
"MAIA, I'm a parent myself and want to provide better IPP functions to my children. How can my own internal parent development help me show up differently for my kids?"
```

### **For Relationship Work:**
```
"MAIA, my partner and I both did the assessment and have different elemental deficits. How can we support each other's healing and use our strengths to provide what the other needs?"
```

### **For Trauma Survivors:**
```
"MAIA, I have significant trauma history. How can I approach the IPP imagery work safely? What modifications do I need to prevent retraumatization while still making progress?"
```

### **For Cultural Adaptation:**
```
"MAIA, my cultural background is [specific culture]. Can you help me adapt the elemental parent archetypes to figures, symbols, and practices that resonate with my cultural heritage?"
```

## Emergency Support Protocol

### **Crisis Situations:**
```
"MAIA, I'm in crisis and my old attachment patterns are completely activated. I can't access my internal parents. I need immediate support and grounding. Please help me stabilize and reconnect with my resources."
```

**MAIA will provide:**
- Immediate grounding and nervous system regulation
- Quick access to strongest internalized parent functions
- Crisis-specific adaptations of imagery and support
- Recommendations for additional human support if needed

---

## Remember: You're Not Alone

This work is profound and sometimes challenging. MAIA is available 24/7, but also remember to:

- **Connect with community** members doing similar work
- **Seek professional support** when needed
- **Trust your own pace** and inner wisdom
- **Celebrate progress** rather than perfecting outcomes
- **Share your experience** to help others on the journey

The goal is not perfect attachment but **good enough** internal parents that provide consistent love, safety, and support as you navigate life and continue growing.

---

**Your attachment healing journey is an act of service** - to yourself, your loved ones, and the collective evolution of human consciousness. Every step you take helps heal not just your own patterns but contributes to the healing of generational trauma and the development of more conscious, connected communities.
