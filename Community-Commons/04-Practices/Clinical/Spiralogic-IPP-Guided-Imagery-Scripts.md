## 🌍 EARTH PARENT GUIDED IMAGERY SCRIPT

### *Functions: Protection, Predictability, Structure, Repair, Boundaries*

*"Allow your body to settle deeply into whatever is supporting you. Feel the pull of gravity, the solid ground beneath you. With each breath, let yourself sink a little deeper into this support...*

*Now imagine that somewhere in this space, a presence is approaching. This is a being who embodies the most stable, protective, reliable love imaginable. This is your Earth Parent...*

*They might appear as a wise elder, a mountain spirit, a protective grandmother, or simply as a feeling of unshakeable strength and safety. Notice what form feels most natural and welcoming to you...*

*As they come closer, notice their incredibly solid, grounded presence. They move slowly, deliberately, with the confidence of someone who has weathered every storm and remained standing. Their very being radiates safety and protection...*

*Look into their eyes and see a love that is as reliable as gravity, as constant as the earth beneath your feet. These eyes have been watching over you your entire life, even when you didn't know it...*

*Hear them speak to you now with a voice that is deep, steady, and completely trustworthy:*

*'My dear child, I am here now and I will always be here. You are completely safe in my presence. No harm can come to you while you are in my care.'*

*Feel the truth of these words settling into your nervous system. Let your body relax completely, knowing you are utterly protected...*

*'I will never leave you or abandon you. You can count on me in every situation, in every moment. My love for you is as dependable as the sunrise, as constant as the seasons.'*

*Notice how your breathing deepens, how your muscles soften, as this promise of reliability fills your being...*

*'I will help you build healthy boundaries - not walls that keep love out, but protective structures that keep you safe while allowing good things to flow in. You deserve to feel secure.'*

*See them creating an invisible boundary of light around you - permeable to love and goodness, but impermeable to anything that would harm you...*

*'When we have misunderstandings or disconnection, I will always repair our relationship. I will take responsibility for my part, and I will never let our connection stay broken.'*

*Feel their commitment to your relationship, their willingness to work through any difficulty to maintain your bond...*

*'You can build your life on the foundation of my love. Let yourself rest in this security. You are held, you are protected, you are home.'*

*Allow yourself to rest in their presence for a few moments, feeling the deep safety and reliability they offer. This is your Earth Parent, and they live within you now...*

*When you're ready, let them place their hand on your heart, transferring their energy of protection and stability directly into your being. You can call on this presence whenever you need to feel safe and grounded...*

*Take three more breaths, carrying this feeling of protection with you as you begin to return to ordinary consciousness...*"
