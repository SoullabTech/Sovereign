# Archetypal Parenting Facilitation Guide

## Core Facilitation Principles

### **1. Model the Approach**
Your facilitation style should embody archetypal parenting:
- **Attunement**: Read the group's emotional state accurately
- **Containment**: Hold difficult emotions without collapse or control
- **Co-regulation**: Use your nervous system to support group regulation
- **Repair**: Address ruptures in group connection quickly and honestly

### **2. Honor Both Psychology and Soul**
- Balance practical attachment skills with archetypal depth
- Validate both behavioral challenges and deeper meaning
- Help parents see symptoms as information about development
- Support soul recognition alongside problem-solving

### **3. Cultural Sensitivity**

## Group Facilitation Guidelines

### **Creating Safety**
- Acknowledge parenting challenges without judgment
- Validate cultural differences in approaches
- Address shame and perfectionism directly
- Model self-compassion and "good enough" facilitation

### **Managing Difficult Moments**
- **When someone gets triggered**: Pause, attune, co-regulate before continuing
- **When advice-giving dominates**: Redirect to personal reflection and experience
- **When someone shares trauma**: Thank, contain, refer for individual work if needed
- **When cultural conflicts arise**: Honor different perspectives, find underlying values

### **Encouraging Depth**
- Ask "What does this situation want to teach your child?"
- "What archetypal energy is trying to emerge here?"
- "How might this challenge serve your child's soul development?"
- "What would change if you trusted your child's inner wisdom?"

- Validate the overwhelm
- Start with one simple practice (attunement or repair)
- Explain how archetypal awareness actually simplifies parenting
- Connect to long-term vision of child's development

### **"My culture doesn't do emotional processing like this"**
- Honor cultural wisdom and values
- Explore how these principles might look in their cultural context

- Adapt language and methods while keeping core principles

### **"My partner isn't on board with this approach"**
- Focus on what's within their control
- Suggest starting with personal practice rather than changing partner
- Explore how to model archetypal parenting without preaching
- Address relationship dynamics if appropriate

### **"I didn't have this as a child - how can I give what I never received?"**

- Emphasize that healing happens through giving what we needed
- Connect to their own inner wise parent
- Suggest additional support if needed
