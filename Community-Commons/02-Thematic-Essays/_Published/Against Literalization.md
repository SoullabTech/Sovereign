# Against Literalization: Why Strange Images Protect the Work

*An essay on James Hillman's methodological insight*

---

## The Paradox

Here's something counterintuitive: **abstract psychological concepts are more dangerous than bizarre alchemical imagery.**

When James Hillman argued that terms like "ego," "unconscious," and "self" could be more easily literalized than images of green lions devouring the sun, he was making a crucial methodological point.

As Stanton Marlan notes: "Hillman believed abstract psychological concepts like 'ego' and 'unconscious' could be MORE easily literalized than alchemical images. The strangeness of alchemical imagery naturally resists literal interpretation, keeping us in the metaphoric realm."

---

## The Literalization Problem

Literalization happens when we treat metaphors as concrete, fixed things with single meanings. When the fluid quality of symbolic language gets frozen into pseudo-scientific concepts.

Examples:
- "Where is the unconscious?" (as if it's a location)
- "My ego is too strong/weak" (as if it's measurable)
- "I need to integrate my shadow" (as if it's a project)

These create the **illusion of understanding** while killing the living quality of psyche.

## The Protection of Strangeness

Now consider these alchemical images:

- A **green lion** devouring the sun
- A **hermaphroditic figure** with sun and moon for heads
- **Mercury** as a trickster serpent eating its own tail

These images are so manifestly **not literal** that we can't help but stay in metaphoric awareness. Their strangeness protects them from reduction.

You **can't** ask "where" the green lion is or "how much" mercury you have. The images refuse to be pinned down.

---

## Staying With the Image

This is the heart of Hillman's methodological contribution: **stick with the image.**

Not to interpret it or translate it into abstract concepts, but to **stay with it**. To let it work on you.

When a client dreams of a black dog, the alchemical approach isn't to say "that's your shadow."

Instead:
- What kind of black dog?
- How does it move?
- What does it want?
- What's your relationship to it?

**The dog remains a dog** - autonomous, mysterious, animate.

---

## Image as Thinking

**Images think.** Not that we think *about* images, but that images themselves are a form of thought.

The green lion devouring the sun is philosophy - a meditation on how raw natural power consumes spiritual pretension, how vitality swallows transcendence, how the body eats ideals.

This is why alchemy provides such a rich library for psychology. Each image is a thinking.

## Applications

### Fairy Tales & Myths

Don't translate:
- The giant = ego
- The forest = unconscious

Instead: Let the giant be a giant. Let the forest be a forest.

### Dreams

Don't rush to decode. Stay with the dream images. The dream isn't a puzzle but a world to inhabit.

### Spiritual Practice

Better a strange mandala or koan than abstract talk of "higher consciousness."

---

## The Risk of System

Even Hillman's own work risks literalization if turned into a system.

This is why Hillman deconstructed his own work. As Marlan recalls:

> "In *Revisioning Psychology* there's a point at which everything he says and comes up with he also deconstructs at the end... he cleans it out."

---

## Practical Implications

**For individual work:**
- Collect strange images
- Resist the urge to decode
- Use concrete imagery rather than abstract concepts
- When certain you know what something means, get suspicious

**For therapeutic practice:**
- Follow the client's images
- Use amplification (more images) rather than reduction (concepts)
- Allow objects in the room to become alive
- Trust what captures attention

---

## Conclusion

The strangeness of alchemical imagery isn't a bug - it's a feature.

It protects the work from the ego's grasping need to know, control, master. It keeps us in relationship with the unknown.

We need:
- The green lion
- The hermaphrodite
- The black sun

Not because we understand them.

**But precisely because we don't.**

---

## Questions for Discussion

1. What images have stayed with you without resolution?
2. Where in your practice do you rush to interpret?
3. What psychological concepts have you literalized?
4. How might staying with images change your work?
