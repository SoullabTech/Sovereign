# Stick with the Image: Hillman's Core Practice

*Why staying with the image is revolutionary method, not therapeutic technique*

---

## The Instruction

**James Hillman's most repeated directive:**

**"Stick with the image."**

Simple words. Revolutionary implications.

**Not:**
- "Interpret the image"
- "Decode the image"
- "Understand what the image means"
- "Translate the image into concepts"

**But:**
- **Stay with it**
- **Let it be**
- **Follow where it goes**
- **Allow it its autonomy**

**This is the method.**

## What Hillman Means

### Images, Not Concepts

**Western psychology loves concepts:**
- Ego, unconscious, self
- Complexes, archetypes, defense mechanisms
- Attachment styles, cognitive distortions

**These become reified** - treated as things that exist.

"Where is the unconscious?"
"My ego is too weak."
"I need to integrate my shadow."

**As if these are locations, objects, projects.**

**Hillman's critique:** Concepts are abstractions that **kill** the living quality of psyche. They're secondhand, derivative, dead.

**Images, however, are primary:**
- The black dog in the dream
- The old woman in the basement
- The green lion devouring the sun
- The snake wrapped around the tree

**These are not symbols OF something else.**
**They ARE the something else.**

### Images Think

**Radical claim:** Images are not objects of thought. **Images think.**

Not that we think *about* images.
But that **images themselves are thinking.**

**The green lion devouring the sun** is:
- A philosophy
- A meditation on how instinct consumes ideals
- A thinking about vitality and transcendence
- A reflection on nature and spirit

**You don't decode it.**
**You contemplate it. You let it think through you.**

## Why Stay With the Image?

### 1. Images Resist Reduction

**When you stick with the image**, you can't reduce it to one meaning.

**Example:**

**The black dog appears in a dream.**

**Reductive interpretation:**
"The black dog is your shadow."

**Done. Reduced. Dead.**

**Sticking with the image:**
- What kind of black dog? Large? Small? Vicious? Friendly?
- How does it move?
- What does it want?
- What's your relationship to it?
- What does it protect? What does it threaten?
- What's the landscape around it?

**The dog remains a dog** - autonomous, mysterious, alive.

**And the meaning unfolds over time**, through relationship, not through decoding.

### 2. Images Protect from Literalization

See [[Against Literalization]] for full exploration.

**Abstract concepts are easily literalized:**
- "Where is the unconscious?" (as if it's a place)
- "How much shadow do I have?" (as if it's measurable)
- "I need to strengthen my ego" (as if it's a muscle)

**Bizarre images resist literalization:**

You can't ask "where" the green lion is.
You can't measure "how much" mercury you have.
**The strangeness protects the metaphoric quality.**

### 3. Images Invite Ongoing Relationship

**A concept, once understood, is done.**

"Oh, that's my anima. Got it. Next."

**An image, if you stick with it, continues to unfold:**
- You dream of the black dog again
- It appears in different contexts
- Your relationship to it shifts
- It reveals new dimensions
- It transforms over time

**This is ongoing dialogue** - the essence of soul work.

## How to Stick With the Image

### Practice 1: Resist the Urge to Decode

**When an image appears** (dream, fantasy, art):

**The ego immediately wants to know:** "What does it mean?"

**This is normal. But pause.**

**Instead of rushing to interpret:**
- Describe it in detail
- Notice your feeling toward it
- Ask what it wants, not what it means
- Follow where it goes
- Let it surprise you

**Example:**

**Dream:** A white bird lands on your shoulder.

❌ **Immediate interpretation:**
"The white bird is my spiritual nature."

✓ **Sticking with the image:**
- How big is the bird?
- How does it feel on your shoulder?
- Does it speak? Sing? Stay silent?
- Where did it come from?
- What does it want?
- How do you feel about its presence?

**Return to the image over days/weeks:**
- Sit with the bird
- Dialogue with it (Active Imagination)
- Draw it
- Notice when it appears again
- See how your relationship evolves

### Practice 2: Amplification, Not Reduction

**Amplification** (Jung's method):
Add more images, myths, stories that resonate.

**NOT to explain the image** - but to **expand** it, give it more context, more life.

**Example:**

**Your image:** Old woman in basement

**Amplify:**
- What myths feature old women? (Baba Yaga, the Norns, Hecate)
- What fairy tales? (The old woman at the well, the witch in the forest)
- What other images arise? (Caves, roots, underground rivers)

**This creates a web of images** - not one meaning, but a field of resonance.

### Practice 3: Active Imagination

**Jung's method** for staying with the image:

- Enter the image
- Engage it as autonomous
- Dialogue with it
- Let it move, speak, transform
- Don't control the outcome

**See [[Active Imagination]] for full practice guide.**

**This is the primary way to stick with an image over time** - through ongoing relationship with it as an other.

### Practice 4: Artistic Expression

**Give the image form:**
- Draw it
- Paint it
- Sculpt it
- Write it (poetry, not analysis)
- Dance it
- Sing it

**Not to "express yourself"** - but to **serve the image**, give it life in matter.

**The image wants to be made manifest.**

### Practice 5: Let It Live in Your Life

**Notice when the image appears:**
- In waking life (synchronicities)
- In other dreams
- In art, books, conversations
- In nature

**The image is alive** - it will show itself in multiple forms.

**Track this.** Keep a journal of appearances.

---

## What This Is Not

### Not Passivity

**"Stick with the image" does not mean:**
- Sit there and do nothing
- Never act
- Stay stuck in fantasy
- Avoid real-life engagement

**It means:**
- Don't reduce image to concept prematurely
- Stay in relationship with it
- Let it inform action (don't bypass it)
- Live it, don't just analyze it

### Not Endless Analysis

**This is not:**
- Spending years "working with" an image intellectually
- Using image work to avoid life
- Collecting dream journals you never integrate

**It is:**
- Active engagement with images
- Letting them change you
- Bringing their wisdom into embodied life
- Using them as guides, not puzzles

### Not Literalism

**Sticking with the image ≠ Taking it literally**

**If you dream of death:**
- Don't panic about literal death
- Stay with the image: What is dying? What kind of death? What follows?

**If you dream of flying:**
- Don't think you can literally fly
- Stay with the image: What wants to rise? What needs to be left behind?

**Images are symbolic** - but we don't translate them into abstractions. We **stay with them as images**.

---

## Why This Is Difficult

### The Ego Wants Control

**Sticking with an image means:**
- You don't know where it's going
- You can't control the outcome
- You must tolerate ambiguity
- You might be surprised or challenged

**The ego hates this.**

It wants to:
- Figure it out
- Master it
- Reduce it to known categories
- Move on

**Resisting this urge is the practice.**

### Culture Demands Answers

**Modern culture:** "What's the takeaway?"

**Therapeutic culture:** "What did you learn from the dream?"

**Academic culture:** "What does the symbol mean?"

**All demand reduction** - translating image into concept, mystery into explanation.

**Sticking with the image refuses this.**

It says: "The image is the answer. Stay with it."

### We've Forgotten How

**Indigenous, traditional, alchemical cultures knew how to work with images.**

We've lost this.

We're trained to:
- Analyze, not contemplate
- Solve, not dwell
- Abstract, not imagine

**This practice recovers an ancient capacity.**

## Applications

### In Therapy

**When a client brings a dream:**

❌ **Reductive approach:**
"The house is your psyche. The basement is your unconscious. The flooding is repressed emotions emerging."

✓ **Sticking with the image:**
"Tell me about the house. What's it made of? How does it feel? What's happening in the basement? What does the water want? Where is it going?"

**Follow the client's relationship to images** - don't impose your interpretation.

**Ask:**
- "What does the image want?"
- "What's your feeling toward it?"
- "Where does it go next?"

**Trust the image to do the work.**

### In Personal Work

**Your recurring dream image:**

Don't:
- Look it up in a dream dictionary
- Decide what it means
- Try to make it go away

Do:
- Return to it regularly
- Dialogue with it
- Draw it, write about it
- Notice when it appears
- See how it changes
- Let it teach you

### In Creative Practice

**Artists already do this:**

**The image comes** (vision, melody, line, movement)

**Don't ask "what does it mean?"** - follow where it goes.

**Serve the image** - let it become what it wants to become.

**Trust the image knows more than you do.**

---

## The Deeper Principle

### Images Are Autonomous

**This is the core insight:**

**Images are not products of the ego.**

They come from:
- The unconscious
- The collective psyche
- Soul
- The world soul (anima mundi)
- The gods (if you speak that language)

**They have their own reality.**

**Hillman:** "The image is an other. Treat it as such."

Not as your possession.
Not as your creation.
**As an autonomous being with its own purpose.**

### Soul Speaks in Images

**This is Hillman's fundamental claim:**

**Soul does not speak in concepts, theories, abstractions.**

**Soul speaks in:**
- Images
- Dreams
- Fantasies
- Symptoms
- Synchronicities
- Art
- Myth

**To hear soul, you must listen to images.**

**To honor soul, you must stick with images.**

**To serve soul, you must not reduce images to concepts.**

---

## The Revolutionary Implication

**If we take this seriously:**

**Therapy changes:**
- Not: analyzing problems
- But: following images

**Spirituality changes:**
- Not: ascending to abstractions (God, Enlightenment, Unity)
- But: descending into images (this dream, this vision, this encounter)

**Philosophy changes:**
- Not: constructing systems of thought
- But: contemplating images

**Life changes:**
- Not: solving problems
- But: living images

**This is why Hillman is revolutionary.**

Not because he had new theories.
**Because he insisted we stay with images and refuse reduction.**

## Questions for Practice

1. What image has been haunting you?
2. Have you tried to "figure it out" or have you stayed with it?
3. What would it mean to return to that image, not for answers, but for relationship?

## The Practice

**This week:**

1. **Choose one image** - from a dream, fantasy, art, or life
2. **Don't interpret it** - resist the urge
3. **Stay with it:**
   - Describe it in detail (journal)
   - Draw it (however crudely)
   - Return to it daily (brief meditation)
   - Ask it questions (Active Imagination)
   - Notice where it appears
4. **Let it work on you** - don't try to work on it
5. **Record what unfolds** - not conclusions, but the process

**Do this for 7 days.**

**See what happens when you actually stick with an image.**
