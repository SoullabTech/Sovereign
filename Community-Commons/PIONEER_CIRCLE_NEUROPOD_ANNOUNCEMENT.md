# The Pioneer Circle Opens: Neuropod Early Access

**For those ready to co-create consciousness computing**

---

## What Is Neuropod?

Neuropod is consciousness navigation hardware — evidence-grounded protocols that support nervous system regulation, state deepening, and developmental progression.

**Not** pseudoscience.
**Not** "digital DMT."
**Not** overhyped frequency healing.

It's a **control system** for your nervous system, validated with biometrics, integrated with MAIA's developmental architecture.

---

## The Invitation

We're opening **The Pioneer Circle** — a 100-person cohort to help build, test, and validate Neuropod from the ground up.

This is **not** a consumer product launch. This is **co-creation**.

**What you'll get:**
- Early access to Neuropod protocols (Tier 1 + Tier 2, 13 total)
- Hardware kit (vibroacoustic transducers, HRV sensor, pre-configured Raspberry Pi)
- Research participation priority (contribute to validation experiments)
- Monthly Pioneer Circle calls (direct input to development team)
- "Find Your Resonance" personalized protocol tuning (beta)
- Lifetime price lock guarantee ($79/month, locked forever)

**What we ask:**
- Regular session practice (3-5 sessions/week during beta)
- Honest feedback (not just praise — tell us what's broken)
- Biometric data sharing (for validation experiments)
- Patience with hardware assembly & software bugs (this is beta)
- Developmental commitment (Bloom 3+ required, field stability matters)

## The Technology (In Plain Language)

### Vibroacoustic Stimulation (20-120 Hz)

Low-frequency vibration through transducers (bass shakers) placed under your body. Your nervous system entrains to the rhythm, supporting:
- **Parasympathetic activation** (HRV coherence ↑)
- **Stress reduction** (GSR tonic ↓)
- **Sleep preparation** (subjective sleep quality ↑)

**Evidence Level:** ★★★☆☆ (Moderate)
**What we're validating:** 3 experiments (N=95 total, Months 4-12)

### ASSR Entrainment (10 Hz, 6.5 Hz, 40 Hz)

Rhythmic audio stimulation (isochronic tones) → measurable neural locking (EEG shows Phase-Locking Value >0.3).

**Evidence Level:** ★★★☆☆ (Moderate - measurable but mixed clinical utility)
**What we're validating:** Does entrainment correlate with subjective state shifts? (absorption, contemplation, insight)

### Breath-Synced Haptics

Gentle haptic pulses timed to your breath (inhale, hold, exhale). Supports breath-paced grounding and HRV coherence.

**Evidence Level:** ★★★★☆ (Strong for HRV biofeedback)

## The Developmental Gate (Why Bloom Levels Matter)

Neuropod is integrated with MAIA's developmental architecture. Not all protocols are available to all users.

**Why?**
- **Low cognitive altitude** (Bloom 1-2) + intense symbolic work = overwhelm
- **High bypassing** (spiritual/intellectual) + depth protocols = escape mechanism (not integration)
- **Unstable field** + altered state protocols = destabilization risk

**The Gate:**
- **Tier 1 protocols:** Bloom 0+ (universally accessible)
- **Tier 2 protocols:** Bloom 3+ (pattern recognition demonstrated)
- **Tier 2 depth work:** Bloom 4+ (stable field + low bypassing)

**Enhanced Community Commons Gate** (Post-Neuropod Launch):
- Bloom avg ≥ 4.0 **AND**
- 5+ Neuropod sessions completed **AND**
- Avg HRV coherence > 0.55 **AND**
- ASSR PLV > 0.3 in ≥1 session **AND**
- Zero high-risk safety events

**Rationale:** Commons posting requires demonstrated nervous system coherence, not just intellectual understanding.

## The Safety Architecture (How We Protect You)

### Layer 1: Hardware Caps
- Max vibroacoustic amplitude: 0.75 (1.5g acceleration limit)
- Max audio level: 85 dB
- Max session duration: 30 minutes (Tier 1), 45 minutes (Tier 2)

### Layer 2: Medical Screening
**Exclusions (Tier 1):**
- Pregnancy (vibroacoustic safety unclear)
- Pacemaker (electromagnetic interference risk)

**Additional Exclusions (Tier 2):**
- Psychosis history (altered state risk)
- Seizure history (rhythmic stimulation contraindicated)
- Severe dissociation (altered state exacerbation)
- Severe PTSD (somatic trigger risk)

**You'll complete a health screening before first session.**

### Layer 3: Real-Time Monitoring
**Safety Risk Score (0-1 scale):**
- Calculated from HRV volatility, GSR spikes, user distress signals
- **Yellow (0.3):** Log warning
- **Orange (0.6):** Pause stimulation, prompt grounding check
- **Red (0.85):** Auto-stop session, offer grounding protocol, log high-risk event

**High-risk events block Community Commons access** (until resolved with clinical safety team).

### Reality-Testing Protocol

**Before Session:**
- "Name three facts about your environment."
- "What is your intention for this session?"

**After Session:**
- "Name three facts about your environment."
- "Rate your experience: Grounded, Calm, Clear, Overwhelmed, Spacey."
- **Meaning deferral:** "Do not assign fixed meaning yet. Let it settle 48 hours."

**Why?** Prevents spiritual bypassing, magical thinking, "it's all a simulation" dissociation.

## What We're NOT Building

Let's be crystal clear about what Neuropod is **NOT**:

❌ **NOT "Digital DMT"** — We're not replicating psychedelic states. We're supporting nervous system regulation.

❌ **NOT "Healing Frequencies"** — We don't claim 432 Hz heals your DNA or 528 Hz opens your heart chakra. That's pseudoscience.

❌ **NOT A Medical Device** — Neuropod is general wellness, not treatment for anxiety/PTSD/depression (requires FDA clearance).

❌ **NOT A Meditation Replacement** — This is a *support tool*, not a shortcut. You still need to do the work.

❌ **NOT Guaranteed Results** — We validate protocols with statistics (p < 0.05), but individual results vary. Some people don't respond.

❌ **NOT For Everyone** — Developmental gating is real. If you're at Bloom 2, you won't get Tier 2 protocols. That's by design.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this safe?**
A: Yes, with proper screening. Vibroacoustic therapy has 40+ years of research with minimal adverse events (<2% in clinical trials). We use conservative safety caps (0.75 max amplitude), real-time monitoring, and medical exclusion screening.

**Q: Will this give me mystical experiences?**
A: No. Neuropod supports nervous system regulation and state deepening, not breakthrough mystical states. If you're seeking peak experiences, this is not the right tool.

**Q: What if I don't respond to the protocols?**
A: Individual variation is real. ~70% respond (based on our expected responder rates). If you're in the 30% who don't respond after 30 sessions, we offer full refund (Month 1-3).

**Q: Can I use Neuropod without MAIA?**
A: Technically yes (hardware works standalone), but you'll miss the developmental integration (Bloom-level gating, archetypal prompts, field safety). Neuropod is designed as part of MAIA's consciousness computing platform.

**Q: How much time does this require?**
A: 3-5 sessions/week × 15-30 min/session = 45-150 min/week. Plus hardware assembly (3-5 hours one-time). Plus validation experiments (2-4 hours total over 12 months).

**Q: What if I have a medical condition not listed?**
A: Contact clinical safety team before applying. We'll review on a case-by-case basis.

**Q: Can I cancel my Pioneer tier subscription?**
A: Yes, anytime. But you lose the lifetime price lock ($79/month) and early beta access. If you rejoin later, you'll pay the current public rate (likely $99/month+).

**Q: What happens if validation experiments fail (p > 0.05)?**
A: We publish the negative results, revise protocols, and either re-validate or discontinue. Transparency > hype. If we discontinue Neuropod, all Pioneers get full refund (12 months of subscription).
