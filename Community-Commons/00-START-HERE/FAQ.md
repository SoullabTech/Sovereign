# Frequently Asked Questions

*Quick answers to common questions about the Commons*

## About the Commons

### What is this place?

The Alchemy & Psychology Commons is a **living library** - a collaborative resource for exploring where alchemy meets depth psychology. It combines curated content with community contributions in service of soul work and transformation.

### Who created this?

This commons was initiated by Kelly Nezat and the SoulLab community, but it's built **with and for the community**. Your contributions shape what this becomes.

### Is this affiliated with any official Jungian organization?

No, this is an independent community project, though we honor and draw from Jungian and archetypal psychology traditions.

## Understanding the Work

### What is "alchemy" in this context?

We're not talking about literal medieval chemistry. **Psychological alchemy** recognizes that alchemical texts describe transformation processes in the psyche:
- **Nigredo** (blackening) → depression, descent, shadow work
- **Albedo** (whitening) → insight, clarity, purification
- **Citrinitas** (yellowing) → embodiment, grounding
- **Rubedo** (reddening) → full integration, life force

### Do I need to know Jung or Hillman to participate?

**No.** Beginners are welcome. Start with:
- [[Nigredo - The Sacred Descent]]
- [[Against Literalization]]
- [[Soul vs Spirit]]

### How do I know what "stage" I'm in?

You probably don't need to know. The stages are **descriptive, not prescriptive**. Don't try to "figure out where you are" - just notice what resonates.

## Participating

### Can I contribute if I'm not an expert?

**Yes!** You don't need credentials to share experiences, ask questions, or offer practices. Lived experience matters as much as scholarly knowledge.

### What if my question sounds stupid?

There are no stupid questions here. If you're genuinely wondering, others probably are too. **Not-knowing is valuable.**

### How long before my contribution is published?

Typically 1-2 weeks. The curation team reviews, may reach out with questions, then publishes if appropriate.

### Can I submit anonymously?

**Yes.** You can choose how to be credited: full name, initials, pseudonym, or anonymous.

**Yes, completely free.** No paywalls, no membership fees.

### Can I share content from here?

Yes, with attribution. You may link to pages, quote with attribution, or share on social media. Please don't copy entire entries without permission.

### Why is everything in Markdown/text files?

Markdown is future-proof, portable, fast, and works with Obsidian and web publishing systems like Quartz.

## About the Work

### Is this therapy?

**No.** This is educational and contemplative inquiry. It is **not** psychotherapy, crisis intervention, or medical treatment.

**If you need professional help**, seek a licensed therapist. This can complement therapy, not replace it.

### Can this help with [specific problem]?

This work is about deepening relationship with psyche and understanding transformation processes. It's **not** self-help techniques or quick fixes.

Some find it helpful for navigating life transitions, creative blocks, or spiritual questions. **But it's slow, deep work** - not symptom removal.

### Is this religious? Spiritual?

**Not religious** - no doctrine, no practices required, no gods to worship.

**But spiritual** in the sense of working with soul, depth, mystery, and transformation.

You can practice any religion (or none) and find this relevant.
