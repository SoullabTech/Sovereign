# Welcome to the Alchemy & Psychology Commons

*A living library for depth work with alchemical images and psychological transformation*

---

## What Is This Place?

This is a **community commons** - a shared space for exploring the rich territory where alchemy meets psychology. Here you'll find:

- **Curated concepts** from Jung, Hillman, Marlan, Edinger, and others
- **Thematic essays** synthesizing key ideas
- **Voices and dialogues** from depth practitioners
- **Practices** for working with alchemical processes
- **Images** from the alchemical tradition
- **Community contributions** - your experiences, questions, insights

This isn't a static encyclopedia. It's a **living library** that grows through both careful curation and community participation.

## Why Alchemy & Psychology?

Carl Jung discovered that medieval alchemical texts, which seemed to be about transforming lead into gold, were actually describing psychological transformation processes. The alchemists were unknowingly projecting the individuation process onto their work with substances.

This gave psychology a rich symbolic library:
- **Nigredo** (blackening) - depression, descent, shadow work
- **Albedo** (whitening) - clarity, insight, purification
- **Citrinitas** (yellowing) - embodiment, bringing insights to earth
- **Rubedo** (reddening) - full integration, life force, incarnation

These aren't just interesting ideas - they're **maps for transformation** that people have found useful for navigating their own psychological and spiritual journeys.

James Hillman developed this further through **archetypal psychology**, emphasizing:
- Working with images rather than concepts
- Soul over spirit (depth over transcendence)
- Staying with the image
- Honoring pathology as soul-speech
- Against literalization

Stanton Marlan and others continue this work, exploring the depths of alchemical psychology in contemporary practice.
