# Community Guidelines

*Tending the alchemical vessel together*

---

## The Container

This commons is a **vessel** - an alchemical container where transformation can happen. We all share responsibility for maintaining this container.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Depth Before Certainty

We value:
- Questions over answers
- Inquiry over conclusions
- Not-knowing over false certainty
- Complexity over simplicity

**Example:**
- ✓ "I'm curious about what that image means for you..."
- ✗ "That dream clearly means you need to leave your job"

---

### 2. Image Over Argument

**We work with images, not just ideas.**

When someone shares a dream, ask about the images before rushing to interpretation.

**Example:**
- ✓ "Tell me more about that bird - how did it move?"
- ✗ "The black bird is obviously your shadow"

---

### 3. "And" Over "But"

Practice additive rather than subtractive dialogue.

"And" holds multiple perspectives. "But" eliminates.

**Example:**
- ✓ "I appreciate that perspective, AND another way to look at it is..."
- ✗ "That's interesting, BUT actually Hillman says..."

---

### 4. Respect the Autonomy of Psyche

Images, dreams, and symptoms have their own intelligence.

We don't:
- Rush to fix
- Impose meanings
- Try to control

We do:
- Listen to what wants to emerge
- Honor the timing
- Stay in relationship with

---

### 5. Honor Privacy and Boundaries

- Don't share others' stories outside this space
- Anonymize when discussing clients/others
- Respect when someone says "no"
- Ask before giving advice

---

### 6. Care for the Shadow

We welcome the full range of human experience, including darkness, anger, doubt, and cynicism.

**But we distinguish between:**
- Acknowledging shadow (healthy)
- Acting out shadow (harmful)

---

### 7. Against Literalization

Keep concepts and images alive, not fixed. Watch out for:
- "The right way" to do this work
- Insider/outsider dynamics
- Jargon that excludes
- Making stages into achievements

---

### 8. Embodiment, Not Just Theory

This isn't just intellectual. We value:
- Lived experience over abstract understanding
- Body wisdom alongside mental insight
- What actually works, not just what sounds good

---

## What We Don't Tolerate

**Immediate removal for:**
- Threats or violence
- Hate speech
- Predatory behavior
- Privacy violations
- Spam/exploitation

**We'll work with you on:**
- Dominating conversation
- Persistent literalization
- Unsolicited advice-giving
- Performing expertise

---

## When Things Get Difficult

Conflict can be generative if we:
- Stay curious
- Remain in dialogue
- Tolerate discomfort
- Trust the process

**If struggling:** Pause, reflect, reach out privately, or ask for help.

---

## The Spirit of These Guidelines

More important than any specific rule:

1. **Does this serve the soul?**
2. **Does this tend the vessel?**
3. **Does this honor others?**
4. **Does this embody what we teach?**

---

**Thank you for being here. Your presence matters.**
