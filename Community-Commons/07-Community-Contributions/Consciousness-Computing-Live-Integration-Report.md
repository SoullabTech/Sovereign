2. **ΔΩ Cognitive Physics Integration** - Mathematical consciousness field modeling in real-time
3. **Spiralogic Elemental Framework** - Five-element consciousness evolution tracking
4. **Nested Observer Windows** - Recursive consciousness observation through AIN Evolution
5. **Interactive Consciousness Computing** - Users can now explore their pilot-drone relationship live
