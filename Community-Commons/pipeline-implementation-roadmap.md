---

## Phase 3: Collective Contribution Enhancement (Months 7-9)
**Upgrading Community Commons for developmental progression**

### Enhanced Community Commons

**11. Contribution Impact Tracking:**
- Measure how contributions serve others' development
- Track wisdom integration and application by community
- Build feedback loops between contributors and users of wisdom
- Create developmental impact assessment

**12. Collective Intelligence Building:**
- Enhance wisdom synthesis across multiple contributions
- Build pattern recognition across community wisdom
- Create collective insight development tools
- Add community wisdom evolution tracking

**13. Mentorship Development:**
- Create systems for experienced contributors to guide newcomers
- Build structured mentorship programs within Community Commons
- Add guidance and coaching development tools
- Create peer teaching and learning facilitation

### Service Capacity Development

**14. Holding Space Training:**
- Build tools for developing capacity to witness others
- Create feedback training for serving others' development
- Add conflict resolution and difficult conversation support
- Build authentic authority development

## Phase 4: World Service Bridge (Months 10-12)
**Supporting transition to external service**

### External Portfolio Creation

**15. Professional Development Support:**
- Create comprehensive development portfolios from platform experience
- Build credentialing systems based on community contribution
- Add professional presentation of platform-developed gifts
- Create transition support from community to world service

**16. Service Launch Support:**
- Provide guidance for taking gifts into external service
- Create ongoing support for new world servers
- Build feedback and development continuation systems
- Add impact tracking for external service

**17. Community-World Bridge:**
- Maintain connection between world servers and community
- Create feedback loops from world service back to community wisdom
- Build systems for continued development through service
- Add support for challenges and evolution in world service

### Ongoing Evolution

**18. Pipeline Refinement:**
- Continuously improve each stage based on user experience
- Build feedback systems for pipeline effectiveness
- Create adaptive systems that personalize the development path
- Add evolution and updating of the pipeline itself
