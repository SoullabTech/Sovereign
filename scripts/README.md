# 🛠️ MAIA-SOVEREIGN UTILITY SCRIPTS

These scripts prevent "recreation hell" by discovering and restoring your existing sophisticated components instead of rebuilding from scratch.

## 🎯 GOLDEN RULES

1. **NEVER RECREATE** - Always discover first
2. **COPY, DON'T CODE** - Use existing components from `apps/web/`
3. **ASK FIRST** - Which system: SageTeal or Consciousness Field?

## 📋 SCRIPT USAGE

### 1. Project Discovery (ALWAYS RUN FIRST)
```bash
bash scripts/project-discovery.sh
```
**Purpose:** Scan for ALL existing components before making changes
**When:** Every time you start working on UI

### 2. Component Inventory
```bash
bash scripts/component-inventory.sh
```
**Purpose:** See what sophisticated systems are already built
**When:** To understand available options

### 3. Restore SageTeal Welcome
```bash
bash scripts/restore-sage-welcome.sh
```
**Purpose:** Activate the elegant daimon onboarding experience
**Result:** Sage/teal gradients + cycling elemental prompts

### 4. Restore Consciousness Field
```bash
bash scripts/restore-consciousness-field.sh
```
**Purpose:** Activate the deep 7-phase field induction system
**Result:** Between onboarding + sublime consciousness technology

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOL

If Claude starts recreating instead of restoring:

1. **STOP** - Run `bash scripts/project-discovery.sh`
2. **CHOOSE** - Ask "Which system: SageTeal or Consciousness Field?"
3. **RESTORE** - Use appropriate restore script
4. **NEVER** let Claude build from scratch

## 📁 EXISTING SOPHISTICATED SYSTEMS

- **SageTealDaimonWelcome**: `apps/web/components/onboarding/SageTealDaimonWelcome.tsx`
- **BetweenOnboardingFlow**: `apps/web/components/consciousness/BetweenOnboardingFlow.tsx`
- **FieldEntrance**: `apps/web/components/consciousness/FieldEntrance.tsx`
- **SublimeFieldInduction**: `apps/web/lib/consciousness/SublimeFieldInduction.ts`

## 🎪 MAKE SCRIPTS EXECUTABLE

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

Your sophisticated consciousness technology is already built - just needs to be copied, not recreated!
