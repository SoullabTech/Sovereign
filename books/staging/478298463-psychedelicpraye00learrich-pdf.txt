          Psychedelic Prayers

"The most         witty of all Oriental mystics translated
 by the funniest of all American philosophers, who
 could ask for anything more? Lao Tse and Tim
 Leary     fit   together so well   I   almost believe in
 reincarnation."
                   ROBERT ANTON WILSON


"As   a   luminous     trajectory, starting   fromTao wisdom
 of the 6th Century           BC   and landing in the
 American scene                 the 21st Century,
                        as it enters

 Psychedelic Prayers presents us with visions and
 choices we can no long ignore."
                        LAURA HUXLEY


"Psychedelic Prayers     is
                              perhaps the best-loved    among
 Leary's    many     books, and occupies a unique place in
 psychedelic literature."

                    The      first   time   I   heard Tim Leary broach the idea of adapting
                   the Tao Te Ching as a guide-book for psychedelic sessions was
                   in Zihuatanejo, in the        summer of 1962, during our first inten-
                   sive retreat       devoted to the exploration and mapping of the
unusual     states   of consciousness opened up by psychedelics.We were work-
ing on the adaptation of the        Tibetan Book of the Dead as a manual for psy-
chedelic sessions that was later published as The Psychedelic Experience. In
that text, Tim explained, the                   main teaching was   to recognize the beautiful

and horrible visions that one encountered, what the Bardo Thbdol called the
"peaceful and wrathful deities," as emanations or projections of one's own
mind. With such recognition, triggered by the spoken words of the guide,
one could avoid grasping for the beauties and fleeing from the terrors, stay
centered and have a reasonable chance of making                      it
                                                                          through the experience
to a balanced re-entry or "rebirth."                  Summing   up the basic advice repeated
many      times throughout this guidebook,               we would     tell   psychedelic voyagers
to "relax    and     float   down      stream."
      In one of our discussions    Tim said that after we produced the
Tibetan Book of the   Dead manual, we would adapt the Tao Te Ching,
which he considered a spiritually more advanced text. The book's essen-
tial teaching, for all of life, was to be like water ... to
                                                            keep flowing. This
was my introduction to the teachings of Taoism, as the work on the
Tibetan Book of the Dead was my introduction to Buddhism. Both have
remained treasured parts of my life ever since. Neither my undergradu-
ate education at Oxford nor the psychology graduate program at

Harvard had included any exposure to Eastern philosophies or religion.
So it was with a great deal of intellectual excitement that I started to
delve into these texts, both of which are                    among    the pre-eminent classics
of the world's        spiritual literature.
      I   believe    my      experience also paralleled that of Leary. A psychologist
highly trained         and     skilled in the Western methods of scientific research,
he   felt   affirmed in his spiritual approach to psychedelic experiences by
iO                                  PSYCHEDELIC PRAYERS            +   TIMOTHY LEARY


the discovery of these ancient spiritual writings. Their essential message,
once freed from the prevailing cultural symbolism, was fully consistent
with the insights coming from psychedelic experiences. Psychedelic
drugs and plants are catalysts for transcendent experiences or they can
be, given the appropriate preparation, attitude,             and context   (the "set   and
setting," in Leary's felicitous phrase).
     The Asian      spiritual texts are centrally        concerned with transcen-
dence, with learning to go beyond the ego-centered perspectives of
ordinary human consciousness, beyond the dualities of right and wrong,
and with becoming liberated from the fears and cravings that character-
ize human existence. For the traditional Asian religious teachers, the

method of attaining such            liberating transcendence     was not psychedelics
but meditation. Their goal, however, was essentially the same              as that of

spiritually oriented psychedelic explorers.
     The period of the           early sixties,   when   these explorations of con-
sciousness    and rediscoveries of ancient
                                        spiritual traditions were being
made, was    time of extraordinary excitement and challenge for Leary,
              a

Alpert, myself, and the other psychologists of the Harvard project.
Unimaginable potentials for human transformation were seemingly
being opened up. Along with repeated experiences of transcendent states
of consciousness through psychedelics, we were experiencing a transcen-
dence of the usual framework of life in an academic institution. In 1962,
Leary and Alpert were dismissed from Harvard,                 my   graduate studies
were completed, and the psychedelic research project that was initiated
there had to find a new home. None of us were particularly disappoint-
ed or hurt by this apparent disgrace. As Tim was to say, it was as "unrea-
sonable to expect a university to sponsor research in psychedelics as                  it

would be  to expect the Vatican to sponsor research in aphrodisiacs."
     The    research and explorations of consciousness continued unabated:
at first   witha training seminar in Zihuatanejo (which ended with our

group being expelled from Mexico) and then (after unsuccessful
attempts to continue the seminar in two Caribbean islands) in a magnif-
icent mansion owned by the Hitchcock brothers in Millbrook, New
York. In the      late   summer of 1963,
                                   a group of about a dozen of us,

including Tim and     two children Susan and Jack, Dick Alpert, my
                           his

wife Susan and myself, and several others, convened in Millbrook and
hunkered down for the fall and winter. Having been rebuffed in our

attempts to establish a public psychedelic research center that would
make   these extraordinary new tools accessible to anyone with a respon-
sible attitude, we decided to retreat and concentrate on writing and lec-

turing and our own personal         work of transformation using          psychedelics
and meditation.
    It   was   a   time of great creative fervor for   all   of us, but especially for
Leary.   Many      papers describing our   work were     written, lectures given,
conference presentations made. The Psychedelic Experience was published
in early 1964.1 continued to edit and
                                      publish the Psychedelic Review,
with the assistance of Paul Lee and Rolf von Eckartsberg.We started to
give workshops, in which altered states of consciousness and changes in
perception were induced without chemical means. We called ourselves
the Castalia Foundation, after the mystical retreat center in Hermann
Hesse's novel The Glass Bead        Game.

     Our   experiences in   Mexico and   the Caribbean, as well as in earlier

group experiences   when we were      still Harvard, had brought us right
                                              at

up against  some very heavy    barriers tocommunication   and coopera-
tion -jealousy, possessiveness, competitiveness, envy, and so forth. There
were also experiences of feeling a warm inclusive unity and non-posses-
sive love for all beings. However, after these experience wore off, the

pre-imprinted feelings of the normal personality returned, made perhaps
more   acutely uncomfortable by the     memory of the               free consciousness

experienced under the drug. The higher, more unified level of con-
sciousness could not be maintained. We saw how we were trapped by
ancient patterns of conditioning.

     Perhaps naively,   we wanted   to see if we could override             them by
consciously and intentionally choosing         to   do   so.   We   began   a series   of
small group experiments in non-possessive relationships,                which were

mostly abandoned after a couple of weeks as being too artificial. Out of
all this, however, came some powerful learning and much laughter at the

ridiculousness of our preconditioned attitudes and habits and the diffi-

culty of escaping       from them. Tim Leary's leadership      style in these situa-
tions     light, humorous, and very engaging. Dick Alpert too had
         was                                                                    a

great sense of humor and told fantastically intriguing stories of his
adventures     on the    lecture circuit. The jazz musician Maynard Ferguson,

together with     his   wife Flo and their three children, lived in the house as
well.We all became very close.
     When we were not working on      writing, lecturing or giving             work-
shops, or trying to free our interpersonal relationships from pre-
imprinted possessive conditioning, we spent time working on the fan-
tastic grounds of the three thousand acre estate, clearing shrubbery and

building little retreat centers and hermit's nooks. I remember winter
walks in the moonlight, when the only sound was the crunching of our
boots in the snow. One crisp, cold day in November 1963 we got the

synchronistic news: Aldous Huxley, the wise elder of the psychedelic
movement, had died, and had taken a dose of LSD to facilitate the final
journey; and on the same day, John F. Kennedy, our charismatic presi-
dent, was assassinated in Dallas. This was a low body-blow to the collec-
tive American psyche     a sudden loss of innocence and idealism, and an

ominous foreboding to those involved in the movement for the libera-
tion of consciousness.

    During the spring and summer of 1964 the Millbrook group con-
tinued their psychedelic explorations, creative writing projects, garden-

ing, and connecting with        artists,   musicians, philosophers, researchers,
journalists.   Ken Kesey and      his   busload of Merry Pranksters arrived
unannounced one          day, after their   legendary cross-country tour. Amazing
feastsand celebrations took place in the extravagantly baroque mansion
that we called the Big House. Millbrook became a kind of Mecca for

psychedelic seekers and adventurers.
    Among       the constant stream of visitors from       New York was    a
Swedish fashion model named Nanette, whose long-legged form was at
that time adorning numerous New York transit buses. She and Tim fell
in loveand moved in together. Shortly thereafter, a friend of hers,
another model   named Kathy, with auburn hair and green eyes, arrived.
      and I fell in love. Both Tim and I, introverted intellectuals that we

were,    felt initially   awkv/ard with these glamorous and sophisticated
denizens of the       New York fashion world. Our LSD     experiences with
them however         swiftly   took us    all   to   undreamed of levels of archetypal
tantric spirituality.
      Another Hermann Hesse novel                     that   had made    a   deep impression on
us was Journey to the East, a story of a group vision quest, a metaphorical

journey to the lands of mystic spirituality. Each of the seekers on that
journey had a personal goal, but all shared the goal of enlightenment
and liberation. "For our goal," Hesse wrote, "was not only the East, or
rather the East      was not only    a    country and something geographical, but
it   was the     home and youth of the          soul." In Hesse's novel, the      group
quest,   though     initially ecstatically inspiring, falls apart          under mysterious
circumstances in a        doomed     place called            Morbio Inferiore.We were also

reading Ouspensky's In Search of the Miraculous                    and   Gurdjieff's Meetings
with Remarkable  Men,        in   which   a 20-year quest in Asia             by   a   group called
the Seekers after Truth     described. Stimulated by these accounts of spir-
                               is

itual quests, the idea of an actual geographical pilgrimage to India had

formed in our minds.
       So when the opportunity arose to accompany an Indian holy
woman, Gayatri Devi, with her group of Indian and American disciples,
on an ashram pilgrimage to India, I jumped at the chance and tried to
persuade Kathy to go with me. Tim and Nanette wanted to join us some
time    later.   Gayatri Devi, or Mataji         as   she was called, was a teacher in the

lineage of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda,                        who had founded          ashrams in
Los Angeles and Boston, had tried LSD and was supportive of the
exploration of its spiritual potentials. So in November of 1964 I found
myself on the plane to India in her company. Kathy had become very
anxious and conflicted and could not bring herself to go with me,
though she held out hope she might come later. After a week's stopover
in Kyoto, Japan, where we conversed with Zen teachers and visited
shrines and temples, we landed in Calcutta, where Mataji had thousands
of devotees. Enormously interesting visits to temple sites in Bhub-
haneshwar, Puri, Konarak and Benares followed. Then we went to Delhi
and northwards up into the hill country of Uttar Pradesh to Rishikesh,
where the Beatles later visited the ashram of Maharashi MaheshYogi.
    Then I separated from Gayatri Devi's group and continued further
northwards and into the Himalayan foothills to the village of Almora.

there with his Parsee wife, Li Gotami, in a cottage                     on   a ridge      with an
unbelievably spectacular view of the                    snow and    ice peaks      of the
Himalayas. Every day I would walk a couple of hours to their house and
discuss various aspects of Tibetan Buddhist teachings with them. Lama
Govinda was impressed with the appreciative dedication we had written
tohim in our adaptation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. He agreed to
try a dose    of LSD that offered to provide and guide for him. After an
                                 I


initially turbulent period of confusion and anxiety at the intense somat-
ic   changes induced, he centered himself with the aid of mantra and
mudra, and had an illuminating experience according to the model of
Bardo Thodol. He expressed his pleased anticipation of a visit from

Timothy Leary.
   During my          travels in India        I   had been writing Kathy and the
Millbrook group my impressions of India. Tim wrote back letters in
which he described the fantastic and joyous spiritual and social carnival
that   Millbrook had become,  his deepening relationship with Nanette,

their wedding, their travel plans for India, and his evolving ideas about
the processes of psychedelic consciousness expansion. He was using the

ethological language of imprinting. These ideas and understandings
formed the conceptual framework for his work in translating the Tao Te
Ching into a session manual for psychedelic experiences. Here are a few
excerpts from these letters:


           The political-education          battle over psychedelics     has been     won
        and from now on         it's
                                       just a matter of time... next generation...          my
        only concern      now   is to    learn to use    my own    head and   to   pursue
        the incredible complexities that develop              when two people      begin to
        explore their potentialities together           and   in small tribal groups.

        Withdrawing energy and commitment from externals and
        materials, etc. You know.
           Nanette and I have been together almost every minute for the
                 weeks and she is an unending series of beauty and wise
        last three

        lessons...We are visiting the Episcopalian minister in town to
        arrange the most romantic, mythic wedding in history... very soon.
        You have     to   give everything to      it   without reserve and then      it   all

        flows from one moment of happiness                to the next... well   you know.

     The     tribal scene is wonderful.

         The      trees are     now   leafless     and etched     black, like sumi-painting

     strokes,     and   the dusk comes quickly late afternoons                and fires are
     glowing     most of the rooms and the house breathes softly waiting
                  in

     for the next period of change and movement... Nanette and I will
     probably be joining you after the first of the year.
         The meaning of imprinting                   is
                                                          "getting involuntarily    hooked      to

     externals, accidentally presented externals at that!!!"                   The process of
     de-imprinting        is
                               getting consciousness back to the flow               and back     to

     the body. Re-imprinting            is
                                             planned temporary hooking back                to

     externals.

       Marriage plans... we are inseparable these days, keeping humor
     and loving detachment while the turmoil swirls by. We think now
     we'll leave for the Orient right after the wedding.

        My      understanding of the "trap of externalization" becomes
     clearer.   Imprinting freezes us              to the outside      the trick   is to   with-
     draw once a week and              then, each time,         make   a carefully planned
     re-addiction to the outside                  systematically reducing the       number of
     externals          and thus allowing for new complexity and                    subtlety.   You
     know.
        Nanette has changed. More quiet, tranquil, amazing patience,
     she moves through the turmoil areas with calm. She has Chinese,

     Viking, south Sweden farm girl things at her core.
         The power of imprinting continually astounds me.                          Frightening,
     unless you continually           and     vigilantly recognize.      We   delight in the

     prospect of seeing you soon.
        Richard (Alpert) has mutated.                     He   has taken over "Tim's role,"
     whatever that means, and                is   genial, hospitable, radiating plans           and
     welcomes.      He    is
                               filling the house with creative          men and      beautiful
     women... Wedding in four days. Incredibly long list of details all

     clicking into place. Nanette is a pure, white fire of honesty and
     love.   We   have been together about 23 hours a day for the                      last four

     weeks.

      was deeply moved and exhilarated by Tim's letters. Readers of
       I


Psychedelic Prayers will recognize the themes of freeing oneself from
"internal distortions               and external addictions" in                 his versions         of LaoTse's
ancient text. The Taoist teaching on the importance of attuning oneself
with the flow of Tao resonates naturally with his statement that "de-
imprinting            is
                           getting back to the flow and back to the body." As his let-
ters   show, he was acutely            sensitive to the fragility and vulnerability of

the imprinting process involved in human love relationships. There was
an exquisite poignancy for me in his messages, since my romance with
Kathy was hanging in the balance. For Tim and Nanette, although they
could hardly have known this, their visit to the Himalayan village of
Almora involved                extraordinarily heightened creativity and spiritual
insight, but          it   also spelled the beginning of the end of their marriage.
     took the three day journey by bus and train down from the Hill
       I


Country to meet Tim and Nanette in Delhi. When I told them enthusi-
astically                 my meetings with Lama Govinda, they
                about Almora and
decided they wanted to go there too. But before we headed back up
into the mountains, we wanted to see the Taj Mahal. We had heard that
once       a   month, around the time of the                  full   moon, the grounds are kept
open       to visitors at night.          We     thought     this   would be an extraordinary set-
ting for a psychedelic experience. During the day we took a tour of the
mausoleum,    our senses heightened by legally available ganja. Our guide
enthusiastically explained the history behind this amazing structure.
"Shah Jehan,               who   built this     monument, was not only                  in love with his
wife,      Mumtaz Mahal              ('Jewel     of the    Palace') but       he   also   had    a   mania   for
construction."              He   built   it   in response to his wife's dying request to
create         something by which she would be remembered.

       Tim     Leary was very impressed by the fact that Shah Jehan built the
Taj as an expression      of personal-human love. He felt that the quest for
enlightenment still always had an element of selfishness ("my enlighten-
ment") whereas the Shah's love for his wife was purely other-oriented.
The    question of how personal passionate                  human    love could be integrat-
ed with the       spiritual quest for liberation         was   clearly a central       concern
for Tim during this period                 and perhaps      a core   theme of his      entire

post-psychedelic life.
    As the sun was setting and the               full   moon    rising,   we   set   up our ses-
sion blanket      on   the grass in front of the Taj. The sight of the Taj               Mahal
in the moonlight is indescribable, even with normal perception. After
our eyes got adapted to the darkness, the light of the moon was brilliant
as daylight, the white marble dome glistened pale blue and silver, while

precious stones inlaid high           on the dome
                                     flashed and sparkled. Like a

mirage   hung
          it                  from  the earth by a thin band of haze,
                       in space, separated

glowing and humming with radiance in perfectly harmonious wave-
field patterns.



                                             &          &
    In his autobiography Flashbacks Leary described how in Almora,

they rented a house high on the ridge, with me in the guest room, and
started a routine       of visiting Lama Govinda and Li Gotami every after-
noon. "It turned out that the Lama and        I shared an intellectual obses-


sion    compulsive penchant for classification." Govinda had made an
         a
exhaustive study of Asian systems of consciousness and Leary, the author
of Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality, had spent years studying Western
systems of personality. They got along famously.
     Tim had brought along nine English language translations of the Tao
Te Ching.      Each    day, sitting   on   the grass in the warm sun under the pine

trees,   he would pick one of Lao Tse's            verses, read each of the versions
and attempt to distill the essential meaning using the perspectives
gained from his psychedelic experiences. Lao Tse's cryptic and profound
meditations       on the   invisible, all-pervasive universal          energy flow process,
were rendered into language that psychedelic voyagers would recognize
from their experiences. Then he would reduce them down to the sparest
possible formulations, distilling, extracting the essence, carving                      words

like a sculptor  hewing and polishing the stone to reveal the figure. Lao
Tse had been                          and princes. Leary translated his
                    a counselor to rulers
advice to them into suggestions for the psychedelic session guide.
     I feel these meditations on
                                  psychedelic consciousness expansion are
perhaps Tim Leary s most inspired writings. They are, by turns, serene,
sensuous, funny, and wise. He continued to work on them after he had
returned to Millbrook, where they were organized as a session manual
in six parts, to be read by the voyager or guide before and during a ses-
sion.   I
            suggested the    name   "Psychedelic Prayers." The six parts, corre-
sponding roughly to the outline              of The   Psychedelic Experience,    were    (1)

preparatory, (2) highest point of pure energy flow, (3) visions of biologi-
cal or seed energy, (4) verses focusing on the perceptual senses, (5) verses

focusing on the chakras, and         (6)   verses about re-entry, re-imprinting, or
return to everyday life.
       The
        three of us also visited Sri Krishna Prem, an expatriate

Englishman who had lived in an ashram as devotee of Krishna-Radha in
                                                  He was an extraordi-

nary    figure, who
                had  integrated Hindu   and Buddhist teachings with the
esoteric wisdom traditions of the West, including Gurdjieff. Where
Govinda was a scholar, a pandit, Krishna Prem was truly a sage a very
down-to-earth, unassuming, humble and humorous one. After our initial
visit, Tim went back once more by himself. I believe that with Krishna

Prem Tim was probably           the closest that he ever      came   to accepting a

spiritual teacher. In Flashbacks       he called Krishna Prem "The Wisest                Man
in India."
    For me, the meeting with Sri Krishna Prem was also a turning
point. When he talked about the so-called "left-hand path" of the
siddhas, the tantric yogis      of ancient times, he interpreted            this to   be the
path of integrating the weaker,            less   developed function.   I   realized that

my meetings and readings with Lama Govinda were only strengthening
my intellect, which was already over-developed. suddenly got the

strong feeling that      I should go back to the States so that I could piece
together      my   fractured romance with the insecure Kathy. In addition, it
was obvious        that the relationship     between Tim and Nanette was under-
going increasing strain, and I felt I should leave them alone to work
things out. It was after all their honeymoon. What was I doing there?                       I

left   shortly thereafter.

      When     I   returned to Millbrook,       it   was to a scene of depressing chaos.
A seedy, drugged-out guy met me               at   the door wearing       my   clothes.
Gone were    the serenity and glowing warmth of Castalia weekends, the

joyous  enthusiasm  for consciousness exploration in a family of seekers.

Instead, the Millbrook   mansion had become an Addams Family house of
horrors, a scene of decadence             and depravity and dabbling in black arts,
of lost souls wandering around in permanently drugged              states, of vicious
conflicts leading at times to physical violence. Kathy's love for                 me   had
turned to hate, as she blamed my and Tim's absence for the destruction
of the Millbrook dream. When Tim and Nanette, their relationship in
tatters,   returned to Millbrook some weeks              later,   he wrote of "the
changes that       had converted Millbrook from            a   community of scholars
and    scientists to a   playground for
                                 rowdy                 omnisexuals." Millbrook had
become our Morbio Inferiore.
   The league of seekers did, however, recover from                      this debacle. Leary,

Alpert and myself all went onto other phases of the story, told in other
books, other high adventures in consciousness exploration. Nanette went
on   to   marry an American Buddhist monk,               who became         an eminent
scholar-teacher of Tibetan Buddhism; one of their daughters                      isa famous
film actress.  A
              tantric love goddess arrived for Timothy in the                    form of
the very beautiful Rosemary Woodruff. The Millbrook community
flowered again with music, meditation, laughter, creativity, happy chil-
dren, and remarkable people.




      Leary s path    after this   took him increasingly into the role of pio-
neering     social   change   activist.His fearless honesty and brilliant mockery
in expressing radical viewpoints            made him many enemies            in high places.
He had      the dubious    honor of being       most dangerous man in
                                                called "the
America" by none other than Richard Nixon. He spent upwards of 50
months in jail on several continents, an experience that left him without
bitterness,   but with razor-sharp insight into the American political sys-
tem.   Hewrote 20 more books, developed theories and models of con-
sciousness and contributed to numerous group creative projects. He
married two more times and became    a great-grandfather before his

death in May, 1996. To hundreds of thousands of his friends and admir-

ers, he remains one of the outstanding visionary geniuses of the 20th

century. To me he was the perfect exemplar of one of those who in the
last of the Psychedelic Prayers are listed as likely to be closer to the Tao

"smiling men with bad reputations."
    I don't believe he ever
                            again had the opportunity to devote himself
so completely to the exploration and description of spiritual develop-

ment, and    how    higher states of consciousness can be integrated into
ongoing   life.   His psychedelic prayers based on the Tao Te Ching integrate
ancient Eastern       wisdom   teachings with the insights of modern science,
and the   practical   knowledge gained fromdirect experience of expanded
states of consciousness. They provide the spiritual seeker using psyche-
delics with an unsurpassed guidebook to the realization of the highest

potentials   of the   human mind and of these amazing     substances.

                     The Publishing History of Psychedelic Prayers
                           with a Note on the Text of This Edition


                                  MICHAEL HOROWITZ
                  Written while Timothy Leary was visiting India in 1965
                  and finished at his celebrated commune-estate in
                  Millbrook,        New York the following year, Psychedelic Prayers
                  is  of 55 poems divided in six sections, adapted from
                       a series

the 37 chapters of Book I of Tao Te Ching (Way of Life), composed by
the immortal Chinese Taoist philosopher and keeper of the Royal
Archives, Lao Tse, in the 6th century B.C.
    Leary was drawn to the "psychedelic" quality of the ancient work.
"My objective," he later wrote, "was to find this seed idea in each sutra
and rewrite     it                       of psychedelia." Leary succeeded bril-
                       in the lingua franca

liantly in his aim:       intended for guided meditational use during LSD ses-
sions, Psychedelic Prayers is perhaps the best-loved among his many

books, and occupies a unique place in psychedelic literature.
     Psychedelic Prayers has an interesting publishing history. The first edi-
tion was printed by famed Beat poet Diane di Prima at her Poets Press
inKerhonkson, NY, not far from Millbrook. The first edition was print-
ed on textured paper and bound in pink wrappers; between one and
two thousand copies were              printed. The second edition    was printed on
laid   paper in   five different      colored inks for psychedelic   effect, and bound
in yellow wrappers;          two    to three thousand copies   of this edition were
published (but not printed)            by the Poets Press.
       Psychedelic       artist   Michael Bowen created a    Hindu design   for the
frontwrapper of both editions; the back wrapper bears the publisher's
alchemical emblem. The author dedicated his book to William and
Aurora Hitchcock, his Millbrook benefactors. Both editions appeared in
the spring of 1966, about a year before the psychedelic Zeitgeist reached

The     Psychedelic Experience (1964),        brought out the third edition in August
1966: a photo-offset copy of the              first   edition, printed in dark   brown    ink,
with nearly identical wrappers to the second edition, in                   a print   run of
5,000 copies.
        The    fourth edition appeared in the early 1970s under the imprint of
the League for Spiritual Discovery, a religious organization founded
                                                                     by
Leary in 1967 and based upon the sacramental use of psychedelic sub-
stances.       Once     again the text was printed by photo-offset; the front and
back covers have entirely             different designs    by Dion Wright. This       edition,
published by the Mystic Arts Bookshop in Laguna Beach, is dedicated to
The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the legendary group of underground
LSD distributors of the brand named Sunshine. This edition appeared
        author escaped prison and fled with his wife Rosemary to
after the

North Africa and Europe. The printing was very small, probably no
more than 2,000 copies, and intended to raise money for the legal
expenses of the fugitive Learys.
       The
         fifth North American edition is the most rare and
                                                           unique. Only
100     were printed in purple ink, with each poem on a separate leaf
        sets

having a border design depicting sacred plants executed by Michael
Green. The calligraphy was done by Daniel Raphael. Each set of sheets
was contained within a customized wooden box with a sliding top panel
on which the title was carved. The work was
                                             produced in Montreal in
1972 through the efforts of Rosemary Leary, then separated from her
husband and living underground as a fugitive. It was not intended for
commercial sale; each leaf was supposed to represent "script" (i.e., cur-
rency)    which could be traded            like a share   of stock.
       The     text    of the                               49 (of the 55
                                Prayers varies greatly in this edition:
total poems)  were printed,  one to a page (necessitating  some  cuts in the

longer poems)   with a number   stamped  on  the verso  of each sheet. The
arrangement   of many  of the poems   on the page  differs from their  origi-
nal lay-out, with aesthetic considerations uppermost. Leary
                                                               expressed
satisfaction      with    this edition particularly the notion of poetry as
"script," for the        author and his wife had sometimes resorted to produc-
ing impromptu manuscripts                which they     sold for   money   in order to sur-
vive in exile.
       The     first   British edition, published      by Academy Editions, London,
also    appeared in 1972. This edition follows the text          of the first edition,

and     is   enhanced with Chinese landscape drawings.
        The       first    foreign translation, a bilingual edition printed in                          German
and English, appeared in Bern, Switzerland from the publisher Mantram
in 1975 with a dust jacket designed by Swiss artist Hans Giger, later of
Alien fame. Two other friends of the exiled Learys, the British writer
Brian Barritt, and Swiss author Sergius Golowin, wrote introductions.
Pirated editions of the                      German             translation appeared        from God's Press in
Amsterdam             & Kathmandu in                      1975, and fromVolksverlag in Linden,

Leary and Metzner                        describe this edition as "being given to a few
friends" with the "hope you will send us your ideas for improving" the
work.

A NOTE ON THE TEXT OF THIS EDITION

                 Two poems from PartV (V-7 and V-8) have been moved to
                 PartII (where
                               they are now II-8 and II-9) as it seemed to
                 the editors these
                               poems properly belonged to an earlier stage
            of the psychedelic experience.
    Six new poems from later chapters of the Tao Te Ching were adapted

by the author and his wife Rosemary in Laguna Beach, California about
two years after the first publication of the book, and published in the
January 17, 1969 issue of New York City's underground newspaper the
East Village Other under the title "Poems on the Conduct of Life." The
text of the poems is preceded by a 600-word preface in which the
author discusses,         at   times from   new      perspectives, the importance of the
Tao Te Ching, and states his intention of publishing "a newTaoist
                                                                  guide-
book which could be called               How
                                    To Live The Turned-On Life In An
Uptight Society." Five of the poems are reprinted here in newly edited
versions (the sixth poem is an experimental sound poem that is better
recited than printed).
       A final poem has been added at the                end of the present             edition.

"Homage         to the Awe-full Seer," the longest             poem     book, was
                                                                            in the

originally published in Psychedelic             Review no. 9 in 1967. Although not                 a
translation     from the Tao  Ching, the theme of the poem closely associ-
                                   te

ates   it   with the wisdom-message of the ancient Chinese text and the
impact made by the sage who wrote it.
    Regarding the text of this edition, readers familiar with the original
1966 edition will notice occasional revision. The editors, who have all
worked  closely with Timothy Leary on literary projects, have been long
aware of Leary s penchant for revising often substantially each of his
books at the time of their re-publication. During the last months of his
   Timothy knew of the plan to republish Psychedelic Prayers which
life

pleased him greatly but was too ill to work on the new edition. He
made it clear that he expected us to make changes we deemed necessary
("It's   your   call,"   he liked to    say).

     Ralph Metzner, co-author with Leary and Richard Alpert of The
Psychedelic Experience (1964), assisted Leary when he first produced these
translations in India in 1965,           and    as   noted   earlier   is   listed as   co-author in
the pre-publication,           mimeographed          edition of Psychedelic Prayers.

        Rosemary    Leary,   who became     engaged to the author while he was
still
        completing work on      this   book, recited the prayers with her husband
at public events during the mid-1960s, making revisions in the text as

they went along; she worked on the adaptations of the additional poems
published in 1969, and was responsible for the remarkable 1972 wooden
box     edition.
   Michael Horowitz, the author's archivist and bibliographer, has per-
formed editorial work on Leary s books for 25 years, from Jail Notes
(1970) to Chaos and Cyberculture (1994).
    While the editors had the author's encouragement and blessing in
taking on the daunting task of re-editing this sacred text of psychedelic
literature,   they take   full responsibility   for any   and   all   revisions, as

Timothy Leary passed away (May             31, 1996) shortly before          we began
working on this new edition.

                            ROSEMARY WOODRUFF LEARY
                       In August 1965, a few                   months after we first met, Tim
                       picked        me up         at   my   apartment in Manhattan and took                   me
                       to the       Millbrook Estate for             a   week    or so before     I   left for

                       California.
       Tim       led   me     to the        tower room. The          window          overlooking the vast
grounds was framed by a Hoya plant whose blossoms scented the air.
Later that evening he brought a bottle of wine and a tattered manuscript
to read      by candlelight. His voice caressed                          me   softly.



           Gate of the Soft Mystery
           Gate of the Dark Woman


       I
           stayed      awake        all   that night puzzling over his adaptations                    of Lao
Tse.   I   didn't      go    to California.

       Recently,        I   rediscovered a manuscript titled                     1   08 Memories of Our
Present Incarnation                which Tim wrote             for   me   while in the California State
Prison      at   San Luis Obispo in 1970. In                     this    passage     Tim    recalls   writing
one of the poems                   in Psychedelic Prayers:


           "Number          1 1.   Millbrook            During   LSD     session.    We   went
           upstairs    and made            love.   I wrote the sex chakra         poem     in

           memory       of your trembling earth beauty. Nov. '66"


       A later reference                  in the   same manuscript    refers to reading the

poems together on-stage during                            the road tour of the Psychedelic
Celebrations later that winter:


           "Number          42. Standing on stage at celebration reciting our

           poetry and hearing your                 soft voice echoing back.          What
           beauty our love created for the world."

       I'd like to     think    so.

       The next fewyears brought summers of love and seminars, fall lec-
ture tours, winter harassments, arrests and trials that culminated with
Tim's prison escape and our flight to exile in Algeria and Switzerland.
    In the winter of 1972, after Tim and I had gone our separate ways,
the Psychedelic Prayers re-entered              my life. A   fugitive,   I   was hiding out in    a
farmhouse near           Ste.   Agathe    in   Quebec. The snow reached above            the   first

floor      and the    electricity   was out. Again, by candlelight,
                                                      I reread and edit-

ed the poems while my friend Brigitte collated the pages and baked oat-
meal cookies and her husband Sergai made the beautiful boxes to con-
tain them. We never made any money from this loving endeavor, but
Brigitte and Sergai Mars, with their baby daughter Sunflower, traded
them        for   food in health      stores across the country. Brigitte later gave
these sets to Dr. Oscar Janiger, Terence              McKenna, and distinguished
herbalists. Brigitte       is
                                including a     few of the poems in her new book on
herbs.



           If you   knew how      to listen,

           the seed   would   hum you     a seed song.


       It   has   been an immense pleasure          to   once again read and         edit Tim's

work, this time in the company of dear friends Ralph Metzner and
Michael and Cindy Horowitz.
       I
            hope    that lovers   and seekers finding these poems             will

                                  FOREWORD
                                 TIMOTHY LEARY
               The psychedelic or visionary experience releases a wide
               range of awareness-of-energy and tunes us in to patterns of
               neurological signals which are usually censored from mental
               life.


    Understanding, description, and intelligent use of these released
energies have puzzled scholars for thousands of years. Today, LSD ses-
sions puzzle, enrapture, awe,        and confuse.
       Mainly they confuse.
       During the      last five years,   1960-65,   we   have witnessed a psychedelic
revolution. Consider the         statistics.

       Over one hundred and          fifty   million Americans share the same

imprinted symbol system             tribal     language and   rituals.

       Of these, a good      ten million have taken the       first   psychedelic step
and experienced the neural level of consciousness have transcended
symbols and contacted raw energy hitting their nerve endings. Here we
include the marijuana smokers, the adepts in hatha yoga, and meditators.
    Another group, at least 500,000 Americans, have contacted cellular
consciousness          have had experiences which transcend both symbolic
game and the sensory apparatus. We include here the peyote eaters, the
mushroom eaters, the LSD cult. If we add those millions of persons who
have had an involuntary psychedelic experience, those institutionalized
mystics   we   call    psychotic, the ranks of this group swell to astounding
proportions.    More       than any other group, psychotics need the sort of
training and guidance provided by psychedelic manuals. They are
whirled into realms of raw sensory bombardment and cellular hallucina-
tion     unprepared and socially anathematized. If psychotics were trained
in the use  of psychedelic manuals such as this volume they would have
some understanding and           control of the multi-level, multiple-exposure

experiences we call hallucinatory.
    Next we have those whose consciousness               has gone beyond game,

gone beyond      direct sensory awareness,         gone beyond cellular flow and

36                                  PSYCHEDELIC PRAYERS                  TIMOTHY LEARY


contacted the molecular and elemental energies that crackle and vibrate
                                  who have taken large doses of LSD,
within the cellular structure. Those
mescaline,DMT, and experienced what the eastern psychologists call
the "white light," the "void," the "inner light."
    Each of these psychedelic levels neural, cellular, molecular are
beyond symbols, incoherent             to the symbolic      mind. And each of these
levels   of consciousness      is   different   from the   others. This    wide spectrum
of whirling energies        all     uncharted and unlabelled            confronts the psy-
chedelic explorer.
    So what is the net effect of these millions of visionary voyages?
      A linguistic babel.
      A chaos of potentiality.
      A confusion of promise.
      Most of these psychedelic voyagers             are   now   aware of the   limitless

       stored in the nervous systems, but there
realities                                                        is   no conception of the
meaning and use of these potentials.
      There    are of course no pat solutions, no easy answers provided by
LSD.     On   the contrary, every paradox, every ambiguity, every problem of

static-symbolic life is intensified, raised to exponential powers. Where
there once was a blind robot symbolic uncertainty (Johnson or

Goldwater?), there is now an uncertainty compounded and multiplied
by the knowledge of the illusory nature of routine reality and the exis-
tence of countless     realities.

      Fromthe beginning of the Harvard-IFIF-Castalia exploration into
consciousness two facts were apparent. First, that there were no extant

maps, models, myths, theories, languages to describe the psychedelic
experience. Second, that the temptation to impose old models, prema-
ture theories     must be   resisted.

      Nocurrent philosophic or scientific theory was broad                    enough   to
handle the potential of the 13 billion-cell computer.
       Our    decision then was to maintain an           open posture, to collect data
on psychedelic      sessions   from     a   wide variety of subjects, in a wide variety
of settings, and to continue to             look for better models and theories to
explain the psychedelic experience.
     It became apparent that, in order to run exploratory sessions, manu-

als and programs were necessary to guide subjects through transcenden-

tal   experiences with a    minimum of fear and            confusion. Rather than       start

de novo usingour own minds and limited experiences to map out the
voyage, we turned to the only available psychological texts which dealt
with consciousness and its alterations the ancient books of the East.
       The      Tibetan       Book of the Dead          is   a psychedelic             manual          incredibly
specific about the sequence and nature of experiences encountered in
the ecstatic state. A revision of this text published under the title The

Psychedelic Experience was our first attempt at session programming.
       For the        last    two   years   we   have been working with another old,
time-tested psychedelic manual                       the Chinese text Tao Te Ching,
sometimes translated                 as   The Way of Life.
       Written some 2600 years ago by one or several philosophers                                                known
to us    now "the old fellow" (LaoTse), this text is still timelessly mod-
                  as

ern and will remain so for thousands of years to come        as long as man

has the     same        sort   of nervous system and deals with the range of energies
he    now       encounters.
       The      Tao Te Ching deals with energy. Tao                            is   best translated as "ener-

gy," as   energy process. Energy                  in   its
                                                             pure unstructured state (the                       E of
Einstein's equation)                and energy         in   its   countless,         temporary         states   of
structure (the              M of Einstein's equation).
       The    Tao is an ode to nuclear physics, to life, to the genetic code, to
that    form of transient energy structure we call "man," to those most stat-
ic,   lifeless forms of energy we call man's artifacts and symbols.

       The message of the                 Tao Te Ching            is   that   all is
                                                                                       energy,   all   energy
flows,    all
                things are continually transforming.
       The      Tao Te Ching is a series of 81 verses which celebrate the flow of

energy,     its  manifestation and, on the practical side, the implications of
this   philosophy for man's endeavors. Most of the pragmatic sutras of the
Tao were directed towards the ruler of a  state. How can the king and his

ministers use this             knowledge of the energy powers                            to   govern harmo-
niously?
       Like     all   great biblical texts, the Tao has                   been rewritten and               re-inter-

preted in every century                   and   this   is   as it      should be. The terms for Tao
change in each century. In our times Einstein rephrases                                        it,   quantum         the-
ory revises it, the geneticists translate it in terms of                                 DNA and RNA, but
the message            is   the same.
       The      practical aspects           of the Tao must              also       be rewritten and adapted
to the everyday situation. The advice given                                   by the smiling philosophers

of China to their emperor can be applied to how to run your home,
your office, and how to conduct a psychedelic session.
     The       Tao Te Ching     is   divided into two books               the     first   comprising
thirty-seven chapters, the second forty-four.
    In this volume of Psychedelic Prayers from the Tao Te Ching you will
find fifty-six poems which are based on the thirty-seven chapters of
Book      I   of the   original.
     These       translations      from English             to psychedelese   were made while
sitting   under    a   bamboo        tree   on   a grassy slope      of the   Kumaon         Hills over-

looking the snow peaks of the Himalayas.
    The work went like this. I had nine English translation of the                                 Tao.   I

would select a Tao chapter and read and reread all nine English versions
of it. Each translator, of course, made his own interpretation of the flow-
ing calligraphy. Nine western minds. But after hours of rereading and
meditation the essence of the poem would slowly bubble up. The aim
was to relate this essence theme to psychedelic sessions. Slowly a psy-
chedelic version of the chapter would emerge.
     The first draft version would then be put under the psychedelic
microscope. For several years I have pursued the yoga of one LSD ses-
sion every seven days. The neurological amplification of cannabis was also
available. Each time our Moslem cook walked down to the village he

would bring back   a crayon-size stick of attar. Attar means essence. The
essence resin of the marijuana plant is sometimes called hashish.
    LSD opened up the lenses of cellular and molecular consciousness.
Attar cleansed the         windows of the senses.
                  these sessions I would read the most                   recent draft of the Tao
    During
poems. A humbling experience                     for the poet   to have his words exposed
to the pitiless magnification               of the psychedelic perspective.
     Psychedelic poetry, like               all psychedelic art, is crucially concerned

with   flow.    Each psychedelic poem                  is   carefully tailored for a certain time
in the sequence          of the    session. Simplicity           and diamond purity          are

important. Intellectual flourishes                and verbal pyrotechnics             are painfuly
obvious to the "turned on" nervous system.
    During these examinations a ruthless process of polishing, cutting
away takes place. Slowly the most blatant redundancies and mentalisms
were pruned.
    Each poem           in this    volume        has   been exposed      to several       dozen
FOREWORD            *   TIMOTHY LEARY                                                   39




appraisals    by lysergicized nervous systems. Each psychedelic "try-out"               is

different.   People     s   reactions vary. What   is   essence-simplicity to one, is
truism to another. The "right" metaphor                 for one is contrived to another.
    Most readers have found five or so poems in                 this collection   which
vibrate in tune to their deepest resonances. The rest              do not    pass the
inspection of their psychedelic enlargers.
    The fifty-six hymns have been divided into                 six groups:



    Part      I.    Preparatory prayers to be read before the session. These
hymns apply          the creative quietude of Lao Tse to the technique of run-

ning   a psychedelic session.



    Part      II.   Prayers invoking pure energy flow, molecular or atomic
energy beyond symbol, sense-organ or cellular energy. These prayers are
                and ethereally during the "high" points which usually
to be read slowly
come during the first three hours of an LSD session.

    Part      III. Prayers     invoking cellular consciousness, seed energy. Odes
glorifying the       DNA code to be read from the third to sixth hour of the
LSD    session.



    Part IV. Prayers invoking sensory experiences registered by the
external sense organs. Hymns glorifying the direct awareness of vision,

hearing, touch, smell, taste to be read from the sixth to ninth hours of
the LSD session or during sessions involving neural ecstatagenic agents
such   as   marijuana, low doses of LSD, hatha yoga, meditation.


    Part V. Prayers invoking sensory experiences registered by internal
sense organs, visceral awareness from the nerve plexes mediating elimi-

nation, sex, heart, lungs, and the frontal cortex. These hymns can be read
during the sixth to ninth hours of an LSD session                when   the subject has
cut himself off from external stimulation.


    Part VI. Re-imprinting prayers designed to guide the subject dur-
ing the period of re-entry (nine to 24 hours), while the subject is
returning to the symbolic world and the post-session imprint is being
formed.

     These divisions             are based    on the theory of levels of consciousness
developed during               six years   of psychedelic research and included in Static
                       [this book remains unpublished editor]
and Ecstatic Consciousness                                                            .




    This mapping of consciousness is based on the neurological and bio-
chemical anatomy of the human body.
     The theory           is
                               simple.
     Consciousness              is
                                     energy received by structure.
     There       are as   many dimensions of consciousness             as   there are struc-
tures in the      body      and decode energy.
                               to receive

    Any high school text in biology can be used to define the dimen-
sions of consciousness.


     1.   There    is   the symbolic        mind    that fraction   of the nervous system
which   perceives, discriminates, interprets,             remembers learned     (i.e., con-

ditioned) cues selectively imposed on the kaleidoscope of sensation. This
is the
       imprinted mind. The prayers in Part VI of this volume are to be
used during the latter stages of the psychedelic experience when the re-
imprinting process begins to impose stasis on the ecstatic flow.


     2.   The nervous system               defines the level of neural consciousness

direct,    symbol-free registration of energies by nerve endings. The prayers
in Part IV of this volume are hymns to the five exterior senses. Odes of
gratitude and reverent readiness to attend to the tattoo of energies hit-
ting the visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory and gustatory sense bulbs.


    3. Interoceptive sensations are messages from internal organs. Most

of these sensations are excluded from symbolic consciousness. Tibetan
Buddhists and Tantric Hindus have worked for centuries with methods
of contacting interior sensations and maps for symbolizing them. These
levelsof internal consciousness are called chakras. PartV of this volume
includes       hymns    to five classes       of internal sensations    messages from the
eliminative, sexual, cardiac,              respiratory and fore-brain   centers.


    4. The unit of life, the building block of the tissues and organs medi-

ated by the nervous system, is the cell. The cell is a highly complicated
structure for registering      and transforming energy. Every cell in your
body      is   an organization network more complicated than the city of
FOREWORD                   TIMOTHY LEARY                                                  41




New York. The              cell registers   and decodes energy and remembers. The
cell     communicative contact with the grosser level of consciousness
        is   in
of the nervous system. The brain of the cell is DNA.The afferent-effer-
ent nervous system of the cell is RNA. Part III of this volume is made

up of hymns praising the power and ancient wisdom of the cell, the
seed consciousness of DNA.


        5. Cells are       composed of smaller        structures   amino   acid molecules
and atomic elements. These structures receive and decode energy. They
are older, wiser, more powerful than cells. The atom uses molecules and
cells    the      way    the   DNA code uses tissues, organs and nervous systems
and the way the symbolic mind uses cars and tractors. Part II of this
volume praises the wisdom of molecular and atomic process, prepares
you for this awesome level of consciousness and guides you through it.

    6. Part I of this volume collects those Tao prayers which are relevant

to guiding a psychedelic session. These prayers are not specific to any

particular level           of consciousness. They present the philosophy of creative
quietude passed            on by Lao Tse.



        The                 all other psychedelic texts, must be studied
                  Tao manual, like

intensively, the detailed theory of energy transformations thoroughly
learned,  and the commentary notes for those prayers selected for the
session reread several times.

       Psychedelic poetry should be read aloud (or taped) at a slow tempo,
in a   low natural voice. The prayers are best read or taped by one who is
"high" at the time. Any tension, artificiality or game-playing on the part
of the reader stands out in embarrassing relief.
     Read by the static intellect imprinted to symbols, and inundated by
the verbosity of our culture, these sutras are simply another sequence of
lifeless words. But to the consciousness released from
                                                        imprinted statics
these prayers can              become   precise bursts of trembling energy     and breath-
less   meaning.
       You        will   wonder, perhaps,    at   the use of the term "prayer" to label
these sutras.

        Prayer      is   ecstatic poetry. Psychedelic    communication.

       Ordinary,      static   communication       in terms    of prose symbols,      is
                                                                                           game.
Mind     addressing mind.
       You cannot describe the          ecstatic     moment     in static terms.
       You cannot (without          regret)   communicate during the             ecstatic
moment        in static prose.
       You cannot produce           ecstasy   with   static   symbol sequences.
       When you        are in a psychedelic state         out beyond symbols               game
communication seems pointless. Irrelevant. Inappropriate. Inadequate.
    There is no need to communicate because everything is already in
communication. You are plugged into the multiplex network of energy
exchanges.
       But thereare those transition moments of terror, of isolation, of rev-

erence, of gratitude... when there comes that need to communicate.
    The need to communicate with the non-game energy source that
you sense      in yourself and around you.
       And    there is the need, at exactly that         moment, for       a   language which
is   not mental or      cliche.   A straight, pure, "right" non-game language.

       This   is
                   prayer.


       Mantra.


       Ejaculation.


       There are moments in every psychedelic session when there comes
that   need to communicate at the highest and best level you are capable
of.

       This need has been         known and     sensed for thousands of years. All
prayers are originally psychedelic            communications with higher              freer

energies  tuning yourself in to the billion-year-old energy dance.
    Conventional prayers, for the most part, have degenerated into                          game
rituals. Slogans.      Meaningless verbalizations. Appeals for game help.
       But   that crucial      non-game   terror-reverence awe-full            moment
comes...


       There comes       that time    when    the ecstatic cry     is   called for.
FOREWORD        TIMOTHY LEARY                                                     43




  At   that time,    you must be ready        to pray.


  To go beyond        yourself. To contact energy             beyond your game.

  At   that time     you must be ready    to pray.


  When you       have   lost the    need to   pray.   .   .




  You   are a   dead   man   in a   world of dead symbols.


  Pray for   life.




  Pray for   life.

                                 The Guide

           In the greatest sessions
           One     does not    know      that there   is   a   guide


           In the next best sessions
           One     praises the guide


           It is   worse    when
           One fears the guide
           Or when one pays him

           If the    guide lacks trust in the people
           The     trust of the people will be lacking


           The wise guide        guards his words
           And     sits   serenely


           When      the greatest session      is   over
           The people        will say:
           "It all  happened naturally"
           "It   was so simple, we did it       all   ourselves."

            When The Harmony             Is   Lost

     When   the
              harmony is lost
     Then come clever discussions and
     "Wise men" appear

     When    the unity is lost
     Then   come "friends"

     When   the session   is
                               plunged

     Then   there are "doctors"

           In   its   passage through the                      mouth
           Is   without flavor


           It   cannot be seen
           It   cannot be heard
           It   cannot be exhausted by use

                      The Message Of Posture

     During the session
     Observe your body
     Mandala of the universe

     Observe your body
     Of ancient   design
     Holy    temple of consciousness
     Central stage of the oldest drama

     Observe              its     structured wonders
       Skin       .   .   .   hair   .   .   .   tissue

       Bone     vein  .   .   .          .   .   .   muscle
       Net of nerve

     Observe              its
                         message
     Does    it
                      merge or does                    it   strain?
     Does    it       rest        serene         on    sacred   ground
     Or   tilt,   propped up by wire and                              sticks?

     On tiptoe                one cannot stand                  for long
     Tension retards the flow

     Superfluous noise and redundant action
     Stand out-square, proud, cramped
     Against the                  harmony
     Observe the mandala of your body

                   setting dark


     Unceasing, continuous
     Branching out in roots innumerable
     Forever sending forth the serpent coil
     Of living      things
     Mysterious           as   the formless existence
     To which        it   returns


     Coiling back
     Beyond mind

     We     say only      it is

     Formed from               the formless
     Life   from     spiral     void

                            Clear Water

             The   seed of mystery
             Lies in   muddy   water


             How    can   we fathom    this   muddiness?
             Water becomes     clear   through    stillness



             How can we become         still?


             By moving with     the stream

          Returning To The Source-Repose

     Be empty
     Watch quietly while            the ten thousand forms
     Swim    into   life   and return to the source


     Do    nothing
     Return   to the source



     Deep  repose is the sign
     That you have reached the appointed goal


     To return   to the source            is   to discover
     The   eternal law of seed


     He who    returns to this eternal law                 is
                                                                enlightened
     Being enlightened he is serene
     Serene he is open-hearted
     Open-hearted he    beyond social games
                              is


     Being beyond social games he is in tune with seed
     In tune with seed he endures


     Until the end of his          life   he    is   not in peril

     Fourfold Representation                           Of The Mystery

      Before Heaven and Earth
      There was something nebulous
      Tranquil       .    .   .   effortless

      Permeating universally
      Revolving soundlessly
      Fusing

      It    may be       regarded        as    the   Mother
      Of all    organic forms


      Its   name     is       not    known nor        its
                                                            language
      But    it is   called Tao


      The ancient sages                 called   it   "great"
      The Great Tao

      Great means in harmony
      Inharmony means tuned in
      Tuned in means going far
     Going far means returning
     To the harmony

     The Tao is great
     The coil of life is               great
PART   III   THE EXPERIENCE OF SEED-CELL ENERGY                         15




         The body is great
         The human is designed             to   be great


         There   are in existence four great notes
         The human       is   made   to be      one thereof


         When you place yourself in harmony with your body
         The body    tunes     itself to   the slow unfolding of life
         Life flows in   harmony with the Tao

         All proceeds

         Naturally
         In tune

                          The Seed Light

     The  seed light shines everywhere
     All forms derive life from it


     When bodies           are created
     It   does not take possession


     It   clothes    and feeds the ten thousand things
     And        does not disturb their illusions


     Magical helix    smallest form
                           .   .   .




     Mother of all forms

     The    living are born, flourish              and disappear
     Without knowing                    their seed creator
     Helix of light


     In   all   nature   it is         true that the wiser
     The older and the greater
     Reside in the smaller
PART   III   THE EXPERIENCE OF SEED-CELL ENERGY                              77




                                  This          Is It



         The    seed moves so slowly and serenely
         Moment          to   moment
         That   it
                     appears inactive


         The garden at sunrise breathing
         The quiet breath of twilight
         Moment          to   moment        to   moment

         When we          are in tune       with    this blissful   rhythm
         The    ten thousand forms flourish
         Without         effort



         It is all   so simple
         Each next moment           .   .   .




         This   is it!

         The    small overcomes the large

         The    gentle survives the strong
         The    invisible survives the visible

               How To  Escape The Trap
               Of Beauty And Goodness

      As you return
      Remember
      Choose   beauty, so
                        you define ugly
      Select good, so you create evil
      As you choose your joy, so you design your sorrow

      The   coin you are     now   imprinting has two sides

      Better to return in the flow of theTao

      For indeed
      The   opposites exist for    you alone
      Beyond your heads and        tails

      Dances the unity

      All sounds harmonize
      All games end in a tie

      Your God     stands   on the pitcher s mound
        nods to   his catcher

        winds up and throws
        a shoulder-high fast ball


      Right into your       Devil's glove
PART VI     RE-ENTRY: THE EXPERIENCE OF THE IMPRINTED WORLD   101




                   For God's Sake-Feel             Good

          As you return
          Remember          to choose consciously

          Power is the heavy stone wrenched
            from your garden of tenderness

          Virtue   is   the heavy stone

            crushing your innocence

          What can be learned
          From nature is
          Harmony
          Therefore
            Shun the social
            Cuddle the elemental
           Avoid        angles, lie   with the round
            Shun    plastic,   conspire with seed

          Do    no good
          But    for God's sake
          Feel   good
          And Nature s        order will prevail

                      The Lesson Of Water

          What one     values in the   game
             is   the play


          What one values in the form
            is the moment of
                              forming

          What one values in the house
            is the moment of
                              dwelling


          What one     values in the heart
             is   the beating


          What one     values in the action
             is   the timing


          Indeed
          Because you flow like water
          You can neither win nor lose

          One who         returns in the flow of          Tao
          Brings back a mysterious penetration
          So subtle
          That   it is   misunderstood


          Hesitant like one          who wades      in
            a stream at     winter
       Wary      as a     man
                            ambush
                                in
          Considerate as a welcome guest
          Fluid like a mountain stream
       Natural       as   uncarved     wood
          Floating high      like a gull

      Unfathomable              like   muddy      water


      How can we            fathom       this   muddiness?
      Water becomes              clear   through    stillness

                 Homage          to the Awe-full Seer


      At each beat
      in the Earth's rotating dance
                    "
      there is born
      a   momentary        cluster   of molecules
      possessing the transient ability to know-see-experience
      its own place in the evolutionary spiral.



      Such an organism, such an event
      senses exactly where he or she is
      in the billion-year-old ballet.


      They       are able to trace     back
      the history of the deoxyribonucleic thread
      of which they        are   both conductive element and
            current.

      They can experience             the next   moment
      in   its   million to the millionth meaning.

      Exactly      that.


      Some        divine seers are recognized for this unique

            capacity.
      Those       that are recognized

      are called     and   killed  by various names.
      Most of them          are   not recognized
      they float through            life

      like a snowflake

      kissing the earth.
128                     PSYCHEDELIC PRAYERS         *   TIMOTHY LEARY


      No    one ever hears them murmur
      "Ah    there"
      At the moment of impact.

      Seers are aware of each other's existence
      the   way each   particle in the hurtling nuclear trapeze
      is   aware of other   particles.

      They move too          give names
                          fast to

      to themselves or each other.

      Such people can be described in terms
      no more precise or less foolish
      than the descriptive equations of nuclear physics.
      They have no more or less meaning
      in the cultural    games of life
      than electrons have in the           game of chess.
      They     are present but    cannot be perceived or
               categorized.
      They     exist at a level   beyond
      the black and white squares of the game board.
                       "      "
      The function of           is to teach.



      Take an apple and        slice it   down   the middle.
      A thin red circle     surrounds
             the gleaming white meat.
      In the center is a dark seed
      whose function      is   beyond any of your games.
      If you   knew how        to listen
      the seed    would   hum you         a seed-song.

      The       divine incarnates teach
      like a      snowflake caught in the hand teaches.
      Once you speak the message you haye lost it.
      Once you know the message you no longer have                       it.

      The seed becomes a dried pit, the snowflake
      a film      of water on your hand.

      Wise       seers are continually

      exploding in beautiful dance.
      Like a speckled fish

      dying in your hand
           eye looks at you unblinking.
      as its

      Like the virus fragmenting
      divine beauty in the grasp of tissue.

      Now and then the "                      "
                                                  sings
      words beyond               rational   comprehension.
      The message    always the same
                             is


      though the sounds, the scratched                      rhumba
      of inkmarks           is
                                 always different.

      It's     like Einstein's      equation      felt as   orgasm.
      The serpent unwinds up the spine,
      mushrooms like a lotus sunflare in the                    skull.

      If   I   tell   you   that the apple seed        message
      hums        the drone of a       Hindu       flute
      will that stop the drone?

      The     secret     of                 must always be            secret.

      Divine sage recognized, message lost.
      Snowflake caught, pattern changed.
      They dance out               the pattern without being

            recognized.
      Caught in the act, they melt in your hand.
      The message then contained                        in a drop of water
      involves another chase for the infinite.
                  "
      The sign of        "is change and anonymity.

      you have killed him.

                          The Psychedelic Experience



Psychedelic Prayers, Timothy                        Leary    s       only book of meditative
POETRY,   IS   A PRACTICAL PSYCHEDELIC MANUAL INSPIRED BY LAO Tse's
Tao Te Ching     (Way of Life). Written while the author was visiting India
IN I965, IT    WAS FINISHED AT THE CELEBRATED ESTATE IN MlLLBROOK, NEW
York the following        year. Psychedelic Prayers              is   the companion volume
to Timothy Leary's High Priest, the story of 16 trips that defined the
PSYCHEDELIC REVOLUTION. ^/Jjl.              .'/J21



Timothy Leary was drawn to the "psychedelic quality" of Lao                                Tse's

ANCIENT WORK.      "My   OBJECTIVE" HE WROTE, "WAS TO FIND THE SEED IDEA IN
each Sutra and rewrite         it in   the   lingua franca of psychedelia."             The result
WAS THIS HANDY TAKE-ALONG PRAYER BOOK.               It IS       INTENDED TO BE READ SLOWLY
DURING A SESSION AS A GUIDE TO TRANSCENDENTAL EXPERIENCES.


This edition of Psychedelic Prayers contains six newly discovered

meditations, several illustrations from prior editions, including the
cover by h.r. glger, and a never before published photograph of
Timothy Leary      in India.   Also included        is   a bibliographical preface by
Michael Horowitz, and an historical
introduction by ralph metzner who
was with Timothy Leary in India
when the book was        written.               i
