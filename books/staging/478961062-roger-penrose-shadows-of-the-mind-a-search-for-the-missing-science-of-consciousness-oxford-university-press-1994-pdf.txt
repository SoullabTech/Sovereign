This book may be regarded as, in some sense, a sequel to The Emperor's New
Mind (here abbreviated ENM). Indeed, I shall continue the theme that ENM
initiated, but what I have to say here can be read entirely independently of that
book. Part of the motivation for writing again on this subject arose originally
from a need for detailed replies to a number of queries and criticisms that
various people have raised in connection with arguments put forward in
ENM. However, I shall be presenting a case here that stands completely on its
own and which explores some new ideas going well beyond those of ENM .
One of the central themes of ENM had been my contention that b y use o f our
consciousness we are enabled to perform actions that lie beyond any kind of
computational activity. However, in ENM this idea was presented as a
somewhat tentative hypothesis, and there was a certain vagueness as to what
types of procedure might be encompassed under the heading of 'computa­
tional activity'. The present volume provides what I believe to be a much more
powerful and rigorous case for this general conclusion, and it applies to any
kind of computational process whatever. Moreover, a far more plausible
suggestion than could be provided in ENM is presented here, for a mechanism
in brain function whereby a non-computational physical action might indeed
underlie our consciously controlled behaviour.
   My case has two distinct strands to it. One ofthese is essentially negative, in
that I argue strongly against the commonly held viewpoint that our conscious
mentality-in all of its various manifestations-could, in principle, be fully
understood in terms of computational models. The other strand to my
reasoning is positive, in the sense that it represents a genuine search for a
means, within the constraints of the hard facts of science, whereby a
scientifically describable brain might be able to make use of subtle and largely
unknown physical principles in order to perform the needed non-computa­
tional actions.
   In accordance with this dichotomy, the arguments in this book are
vi                                   Preface

presented in two separate parts. Part I provides a thorough and detailed
discussion, strongly supporting my thesis that consciousness, in its particular
manifestation in the human quality of 'understanding', is doing something
that mere computation cannot. I make clear that the term 'computation'
includes both 'top-down' systems, which act according to specific well­
understood algorithmic procedures, and 'bottom-up' systems, which are more
loosely programmed in ways that allow them to learn by experience. Central
to the arguments of Part I, is the famous theorem of Godel, and a very
thorough examination of the relevant implications of Godel's theorem is
provided. This greatly extends earlier arguments provided by Godel himself,
by Nagel and Newman, and by Lucas; and all the various objections that I am
aware of are answered in detail. In relation to this, some thorough arguments
are given against bottom-up systems (as well as top-down ones) being capable
of ever achieving genuine intelligence. The conclusions are that conscious
thinking must indeed involve ingredients that cannot be even simulated
adequately by mere computation; still less could computation, of itself alone,
evoke any conscious feelings or intentions. Accordingly, the mind must indeed
be something that cannot be described in any kind of computational terms.
   In Part II, the arguments turn to physics and to biology. The line of
reasoning, though containing portions which are decidedly more tentative
than the rigorous discussion of Part I, represents a genuine attempt to
understand how such non-computational action might arise within scientifi­
cally comprehensible physical laws. The basic principles of quantum
mechanics are introduced afresh-it being not required that the reader have
any prior knowledge of quantum theory. The puzzles, paradoxes, and
mysteries of that subject are analysed in some depth, using a number of new
examples which graphically illustrate the important roles of non-locality and
counterfactuality, and of deep issues raised by the phenomenon of quantum
entanglement. I shall argue strongly for a need for a fundamental change, at a
certain clearly specified level, in our present quantum-mechanical world-view.
 (These ideas relate closely to recent work by Ghirardi, Di6si, and others.)
There are significant differences between the ideas that I shall argue for here
and those promoted in ENM.
    I am suggesting that a physical non-computability-needed for an
explanation of the non-computability in our conscious actions-enters at this
level. Accordingly, I require that the level at which this physical non­
computability is significant must have importance in brain action. It is here
where my present proposals differ most substantially from those of ENM . I
 argue that whereas neuron signals may well behave as classically determinate
events, the synaptic connections between neurons are controlled at a deeper
 level, where it is to be expected that there is important physical activity at the
 quantum-classical borderline. The specific proposals I am making require
 that there be large-scale quantum-coherent behaviour (in accordance with
 proposals that have been put forward by Frohlich) occurring within the
                                    Preface                                   vii

microtubules in the cytoskeletons of neurons. The suggestion is that this
quantum activity ought to be non-computationally linked to a computation­
like action that has been argued by Hameroff and his colleagues to be taking
place along microtubules.
   The arguments that I am presenting point to several places where our
present-day pictures fall profoundly short of providing us with a scientific
understanding of human mentality. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the
phenomenon of consciousness must remain outside scientific explanation. I
argue strongly, as I did in ENM, that there should indeed be a scientific path to
the understanding of mental phenomena, and that this path should start with a
deeper appreciation of the nature of physical reality itself. I feel that it is
important that any dedicated reader, wishing to comprehend how such a
strange phenomenon as the mind can be understood in terms of a material
physical world, should gain some significant appreciation of how strange
indeed are the rules that must actually govern that 'material' of our physical
world.
   Understanding is, after all, what science is all about-and science is a great
deal more than mere mindless computation.

For their assistance to me in the writing of this book, there are many people to
whom I am greatly indebted-too many 1o thank individually, even if l could
recall all their names. However, I am especially grateful to Guido
Bacciagaluppi and Jeremy Butterfield for their criticisms of portions of an
early draft, in which they unearthed an important error in the reasoning, as it
had stood at the time, in what is now part of Chapter 3. I am grateful also to
Abhay Ashtekar, Bryan Birch, Geoff Brooker, David Chalmers, Francis
Crick, David Deutsch, Susan Greenfield, Andrew Hodges, Dipankar Home,
Ezio Insinna, Dan Isaacson, Roger James, Richard Jozsa, John Lucas, Bill
McColl, Claus Moser, Graeme Michison, Ted Newman, Oliver Penrose,
Jonathan Penrose, Stanley Rosen, Ray Sachs, Graeme Segal, Aaron Sloman,
Lee Smolin, Ray Streater, Valerie Willoughby, Anton Zeilinger, and especially
Artur Ekert for various pieces of information and assistance. There have been
innumerable correspondents and people offering verbal comments concerning
my previous book The Emperor's New Mind. I thank them her�ven though
most of them are still awaiting my replies to their letters! Without my having
the benefit of their differing viewpoints concerning my earlier book, it is
unlikely that I should have embarked upon the daunting task of writing
another.
  I am grateful to the organizers of the Messenger Lectures at Cornell
University (which I gave under the same title as the final section of this book),
the Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews, the Forder Lectures in
New Zealand the Gregynogg Lectures at the University of Aberystwyth, and a
distinguished lecture series at the Five Colleges, Amherst, Massachusetts, in
addition to innumerable 'one-off' talks in different parts of the world. These
gave me the opportunity to air my views and to obtain valuable reactions from
the audiences. I thank the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge, and also
Syracuse University and Penn State University for their hospitality in
awarding me, respectively, a Visiting Distinguished Professorship in
Mathematics and Physics, and the Francis R. Pentz and Helen M. Pentz

Distinguished Professorship of Physics and Mathematics. I thank also the
National Science Foundation for support under contracts PHY 86-12424 and
PHY 43-96246.
   Finally, there are three people who deserve special mention. Angus
Macintyre's selfless assistance and support in checking over my arguments
concerning mathematical logic in Chapters 2 and 3, and in providing me with
many needed references, has been enormously helpful. I offer him my very
particular warm thanks. Stuart Hameroff taught me about the cytoskeleton
and its microtubules-structures that, two years ago, I had not even known
existed! I thank him greatly for this invaluable information, and for his
assistance with checking the major part of Chapter 7. And I shall always
remain indebted to him for opening my eyes to the wonders of a new world.
He, like the others I thank, is of course in no way responsible for any of the
errors that undoubtedly remain in this book. Most of all, my beloved Vanessa
is owed particular thanks on several counts: for explaining to me why parts of
the book needed rewriting; for soul-saving assistance with the references; and
for her love, her patience, and her deep understanding, especially when I
continually underestimate the time that my writing takes me! Oh yes, and I
thank her also for-unbeknown to her-partially supplying me with a model,
in my imagination, for the Jessica of my little story. It is my regret that I did not
actually know her at that age!

            NOTES TO THE READER




Certain portions of this book differ very greatly from others, with regard to the
degree of technicality that is involved. The most technical parts of the book are
Appendices A and C, but there would be no significant loss for most readers if
they simply ignore all the appendices. The same may be said of the more
technical parts of Chapter 2, and certainly of Chapter 3. These are mainly for
those readers who need to be persuaded of the strength of the case I am making
against any purely computational model of human understanding. The more
persuadable (or hurried) reader may, on the other hand, prefer a relatively
painless route to the essentials of this case. This route is obtained by merely
reading the fantasy dialogue of §3.23, preferably preceded by Chapter 1, and
by §2.1-§2.5 and §3.1.
   Some of the more serious mathematics encountered in this book arises in
relation to the discussions of quantum mechanics. This occurs especially with
regard to the Hilbert space descriptions of §5.12-§5.18 and, most particularly,
the discussions in §6.4-§6.6 centred around the density matrix-important for
the appreciation of why we shall eventually need an improved theory of
quantum mechanics ! My general advice to non-mathematical readers (or even
to mathematical ones, for that matter), upon their encountering a daunting­
looking mathematical expression, is simply to pass it by-as soon as it
becomes clear that no further examination of it will easily conjure up any
further understanding. It is true that the subtleties of quantum mechanics
cannot be fully appreciated without some acquaintance with its elegant but
mysterious mathematical underpinnings; yet something of the flavour of that
subject will nevertheless come through even when its mathematics is totally
ignored.
   In addition, I must offer an apology to the reader on a quite different matter.
I can well appreciate that she or he might take exception, were I to refer to her
or him in a way that appears to make presumptions as to her or his sex-and I
shall certainly not do so! Yet, in the kind of discussion that will frequently be
xvi                              Notes to the reader

encountered in this book, it may be necessary to refer to some abstract person
such as an 'observer' or a 'physicist'. lt is clear that there is no implication as to
the sex of such an individual, but the English language does not have a neutral
gender third-person singular pronoun. Repeated use of phrases like 'he or she'
are certainly awkward. Moreover the modern tendency to use 'they', 'them', or
'their' as singular pronouns is grammatically offensive; nor can I see any merit
grammatically, stylistically, or humanistically in alternating between 'she' and
'he' when referring to impersonal or metaphoric individuals.
   Accordingly, I have adopted the policy, in this book, of generally using the
pronouns 'he', 'him', and 'his' when referring to an abstract person. This is to
carry no implication as to his sex. He is not to be thought of as male; nor is he
to be taken as female. There may, however, be some suggestion that he is to be
sentient, so referring to him as an 'it' seems inappropriate. I trust that no
female reader will feel offended that my (abstract) three-eyed colleague on
a-Centauri is referred to 'he' in §5.3, §5.18, and §7. 1 2, nor that this pronoun is
used also for the entirely impersonal individuals of §1 . 1 5, §4.4, §6.5, §6.6, and
 §7. 10. On the other hand, I trust that no male reader will be offended by the
fact that I use the pronoun 'her' both for the clever spider of §7. 7 and for the
devoted and sensitive elephant of §8.6 (for the clear-cut reason that, in this
case, they are both known to be actually female), nor that the intricately
behaving paramecium of §7 .4 is also referred to as 'she' (being taken as 'female'
for the inadequate reason that she is directly capable of reproducing her
kind}-nor, even, that Mother Nature is herself a 'she', in §7.7.
   As a final comment, I should point out that the page references to The
Emperor's New Mind (ENM) always pertain to the original hardback version.
The pagination of the US (Penguin) paperback is basically the same, but the
non-US (Vintage) paperback numbering differs, being closely approximated
by the formula

where n is the hardback page-number given here.

   ESSICA ALWAYS felt slightly nervous when she entered this part of the cave.
J'Daddy? Suppose that great boulder fell down from where it's wedged
between those other rocks. Wouldn't it block our way out, and we'd never,
ever, ever get home again?'
   'It would, but it won't', replied her father a little distractedly, and somewhat
unnecessarily brusquely, as he seemed more interested in how his various
plant samples were accustoming themselves to the dank and dark conditions
in this, the most remote corner of the cave.
   'But, how do you know it won't, Daddy?' Jessica persisted.
   'That boulder's probably been there for many thousands of years. It's not
going to come down just when we're here.'
   Jessica was not at all happy with this. 'Surely, if it's going to fall down
sometime, then the longer it's been there, the more likely it's going to fall down
now?'
   Jessica's father stopped prodding at his plants and looked at Jessica, with a
faint smile on his face. 'No, it's not like that at all.' His smile became more
noticeable, but now more inward. 'Actually, you could even say that the longer
that it's been there, the less likely that it's going to fall down when we're here.'
No further explanation was evidently forthcoming, and he turned his
attentions back to his plants.
   Jessica hated her daddy when he was in these moods-no she didn't; she
always loved her daddy, more than anything or anybody, but she still wished
he didn't have moods like that. She knew they were something to do with him
being a scientist, but she still didn't understand. She even hoped that she might
someday be a scientist herself, but if she did, she'd make sure she never had
moods like that.
   At least she'd stopped worrying that the boulder might actually fall down
and block the cave. She could see that her daddy wasn't afraid that it might,
and her daddy's confidence made her feel confident too. She didn't understand
her daddy's explanation, but she knew that her daddy was always right about
2                                    Prologue

that kind of thing-or at least he almost always was. There was that argument
about the clocks in New Zealand, when mummy said one thing but daddy
insisted that the opposite thing was true. Then three hours later daddy came
down from his study and said that he was sorry, and he was wrong, and she'd
been right all along! That was funny ! 'I bet that mummy could have been a
scientist too if she'd wanted to be', she thought to herself, 'and she wouldn't
have had strange moods like daddy has'.
   Jessica was more careful to put her next question at a moment when her
daddy had just finished what he had just been doing and hadn't quite started
what he was just going to do. 'Daddy? I know that the boulder isn't going to
fall down. But let's just imagine that it did, and we're trapped here for the rest
of our lives. Would the whole cave get very dark? Wou,Jd we be able to
breathe?'
   'What an unpleasant thought !' answered Jessica's father. Then he looked
carefully at the shape and size of the boulder, and at the opening in the cave.
'Mmmm', he said, 'yes, I think that the boulder would fill the entrance-hole
very tightly. There would certainly be some space for air to get in and out, so
we wouldn't suffocate. As for light, well I think that there would be a small
roundish crack at the top that would let some light in, hut it would be very
dark-much darker than it is now. But I'm pretty sure that we could see all
right, once we'd got used to it. It wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid! But I can tell
you one thing: if I had to live here the rest of my life with anyone, then I'd
rather it was with my wonderful Jessica than with anyone else in the whole
wide world-and with mummy too, of course.'
   Jessica remembered why she loved her daddy so much ! 'I want mummy in
here too, in my next question, because I'm going to suppose that the boulder
fell down before I was even born and you and mummy had me here in the cave,
and I grew up with you here . . . and we could keep alive by eating all your
funny plants.'
   Her father looked at her a little oddly, but said nothing.
   'Then I would never have known any life at all except this here in the cave.
How could I know what the real world outside was like? Could I know that
there are trees in it, and birds, and rabbits and other things? Of course you
could tell me these things, because you'd known them yourselves before you
got trapped, but how would /know-1 mean how would I really know myself,
rather than just having to believe what you said?'
   Her father stopped and thought for a few minutes. Then he said: 'Well, I
suppose that every now and again, on a sunny day, a bird might fly exactly in
line between the sun and the crack, and then we could see its shadow on the
cave wall behind. Of course its shape would be distorted somewhat, on the
 rather irregular-shaped wall, but we could learn how to correct for that. If the
crack was small and round enough, then the bird might cast quite a clearly
 defined shadow, but if not, then we might have to make other kinds of
 corrections also. Then, if the same bird were to fly across many times, we might
                                     Prologue                                     3

begin to get quite a good picture of what it actually looks like, and how it flies,
and so on, just from its shadow. Again, when the sun was low in the sky, there
might happen to be a tree, suitably positioned between the sun and our crack,
with its leaves waving, so that we could begin to get a picture of this tree, too,
from its shadow. And perhaps from time to time a rabbit might jump up into
the way of our crack, so we could begin to picture it from its shadow too.'
   'That's interesting', said Jessica. She paused for a few moments, and then
said: 'Do you think that it would be possible for us to make a real scientific
discovery, while stuck down here in the cave? Imagine that we had made a big
discovery about the outside world, and then we were in here having one of
your big conferences, trying to persuade everyone else that we were right-of
course all the other people at the conference (and you as well) would have to
have been brought up in the cave too, otherwise it's cheating. But it's all right
for them to be brought up in the cave too, because you've got lots and lots of
funny plants and we could all live off them!'
   This time, Jessica's father visibly winced, but still he said nothing. He looked
pensive for several minutes. Then: 'Yes, I think it would be possible. But, you
see, the hardest thing would be to try to persuade them that any outside world
existed at all. All that they would know about would be the shadows, and how
they moved about and changed from time to time. To them, the complicated
wiggling shadows and things on the cave wall would be all that there was to the
world. So, part of our task would be to convince people that there actually is
an outside world that our theory refers to. In fact, these two things would go
together. Having a good theory of the outside world would be an important
part of making people accept that it was really there!'
   'OK Daddy, what's our theory?'
   'Not so fast . . . just a minute . . . here it is: the earth goes round the sun!'
   'That's not a very new theory.'
   'No-it's actually nearly twenty-three centuries old-nearly as old as the
length of time that boulder's been wedged there near the entrance! But in our
imagination we've all spent our entire lives in the cave, and the people
wouldn't have ever heard of such an idea before. We'd have to convince them
that there was really such a thing as the sun-and even as the earth, for that
matter. The idea is that the simple elegance of our theory in explaining all sorts
of fine details of the movement of the light and shadows would eventually
persuade most of the people at the conference that not only is there actually a
very bright thing out there-that we're calling the "sun"-but that the earth is
in continual motion around it, spinning on its axis all the time.'
   'Would it be very difficult to persuade them?'
   'It certainly would! In fact we'd have to do two quite different kinds of thing.
First, we'd need to show how our simple theory explains in a very accurate way
an awful lot of very detailed data concerning how the bright spot, with its
shadows, moves about on the cave wall. Now, some people might be
persuaded by this, but others would point out that there's a much more
4                                    Prologue

"common-sense" picture in which the sun moves around the earth. In detail,
that picture would be more complicated than the one that we are putting
forward. But these people would prefer to stick to their complicated one­
reasonably enough-because they simply couldn't accept the possibility that
the cave was moving around at about a hundred thousand kilometres per
hour, as our theory would require.'
   'Gosh, is it really doing that?'
   'Yes, that sort of thing. So for the second part of our argument, we'd have to
change tack completely and do something that a lot of people at the conference
would think was completely irrelevant. We'd be rolling balls down tracks and
swinging pendulums and that sort of thing-just to show that the physical
laws that govern the behaviour of things in the cave would be unaffected if the
whole contents of the cave were moving in any direction you like, at any speed
you like. This would show them that they wouldn't actually feel anything if the
cave moves around at an enormous speed. That's one of the important things
that Galileo had to show-you remember about him from that book I got
you?'
   'Of course I do! Oh dear, the whole thing sounds awfully complicated. I bet
that lots of people at our conference will go off to sleep, j\lst as I've seen them
do at real conferences when you're giving a lecture.'
   Jessica's father reddened just noticeably. 'I expect you're right! Yes, but I'm
afraid that this is what science is often like: lots and lots of details, most of
which can seem very boring and sometimes almost completely irrelevant to the
picture that you're trying to get across, even if that final picture might have a
striking simplicity to it, as with our idea that the earth spins as it goes round a
thing called the sun. Some people might not feel that they need to bother with
all the boring details because they find the idea plausible enough anyway. But
the real sceptics would want to check through everything, looking for possible
loopholes.'
   'Thank you daddy! I always like it when you talk to me about things like
this, when you sometimes get all red and excited. But can we go back now? It's
getting dark and I'm tired and hungry-and a bit cold.'
   'Come on then.' Jessica's father put his jacket over her shoulders, collected
up his things and put his arm around her, to guide her out of the now
darkening cave entrance. As they made their exit, Jessica looked up at the

                  the Mind

       Consciousness and computation




                          1 . 1 Mind and science
What is the ultimate scope of science? Is it just the material attributes of our
universe that are amenable to its methods, whereas our mental existence must
forever lie outside its compass? Or might we someday come to a proper
scientific understanding of the shadowy mystery of minds? Is the phenomenon
of human consciousness something that is beyond the scope of scientific
enquiry, or may the power of scientific method one day resolve the problem of
the very existence of our conscious selves?
   There are those who would believe that we may actually be close to a
scientific understanding of consciousness; that this phenomenon holds no
mystery, and even that all the essential ingredients may already be in place.
They argue that it is merely a matter of the extreme complication and
organizational sophistication of our brains that at present limits our
understanding of human mentality-a complication and sophistication
certainly not to be underestimated, but where there are no matters of principle
that might take us beyond our present-day scientific pictures. On the other end
of the scale are those who would maintain that the matters of the mind and
spirit-and the very mystery of human consciousness-are things that we
cannot ever hope to address adequately by the cold and calculational
procedures of an unfeeling science.
   In this book, I shall attempt to address the question of consciousness from a
scientific standpoint. But I shall strongly contend-by use of scientific
argument-that an essential ingredient is Illissing from our present-day
scientific picture. This missing ingredient would be needed in order that the
central issues of human mentality could ever be accommodated within a
coherent scientific world-view. I shall maintain that this ingredient is itself
something that is not beyond science-although, no doubt, it is an
appropriately expanded scientific world-view that we shall need. In Part II of
this book, I shall try to guide tqe reader in a very specific direction aimed at
such an extension of our present-day picture of the physical universe. It is a
direction that involves an important change in the most basic of our physical
8                        Consciousness and computation

laws, and I shall be fairly specific about what the nature of this change must be
and of how it might apply to the biology of our brains. Even with our limited
present understanding of the nature of this missing ingredient, we can begin to
point to where it must be making its mark, and how it should be providing one
vital contribution to whatever it is that underlies our conscious feelings and
actions.
   Though, of necessity, some of the arguments I shall give are not altogether
simple, I have tried to make my case as clearly as I can, using only elementary
notions where possible. In places, some mathematical technicalities are
introduced, but only when they are necessary, or are otherwise helpful for
improving the clarity of the discussion. Whilst I have learnt not to expect
everyone to be persuaded by the kinds of argument that I shall be presenting, I
would suggest, nevertheless, that these arguments do deserve careful and
dispassionate consideration; for they provide a case which should not be
ignored.
   A scientific world-view which does not profoundly come to terms with the
problem of conscious minds can have no serious pretensions of completeness.
Consciousness is part of our universe, so any physical theory which makes no
proper place for it falls fundamentally short of providing a genuine description
of the world. I would maintain that there is yet no physical, biological, or
computational theory that comes very close to explaining our consciousness
and consequent intelligence; but that should not deter us from striving to
search for one. It is with such aspirations in mind that the arguments of this
book are presented. Perhaps someday the fully appropriate collection of ideas
will be brought about. If so, our philosophical outlook can hardly be other
than profoundly altered. Yet, all scientific knowledge is a two-edged sword.
What we actually do with our scientific knowledge is another matter. Let us try
to see where our views of science and the mind may be taking us.



           1 .2 Can robots save this troubled world?
As we open our newspapers or watch our television screens, we seem to be
continually assaulted by the fruits of Mankind's stupidity. Countries, or parts
of countries, are set against one another in confrontations that may, from time
to time, flare into hideous warfare. Excessive religious fervour, or nationalism,
or separate ethnic interests, or mere linguistic or cultural differences, or the
self-seeking interests of particular demagogues, may result in continuing
unrest and violence, sometimes boiling over to outbursts of unspeakable
atrocity. Oppressively authoritarian regimes still subjugate their peoples,
keeping them in check by the use of death squads and torture. Yet, those who
are oppressed, and who might seem to have a common purpose, are often
locked in conflict with one another, and when given a freedom that they may
                          Consciousness and computation                         9

have been long denied, may seem to choose to use that freedom in horribly self­
destructive ways. Even in those fortunate countries where there is prosperity,
peace, and democratic freedom, resources and manpower are squandered in
apparently senseless ways. Is this not a clear indication of the general stupidity
of Man? Though we believe ourselves to represent the pinnacle of intelligence
in the animal kingdom, this intelligence seems sadly inadequate to handle
many of the problems that our own society continues to confront us with.
   Yet, the positive achievements of our intelligence cannot be denied. Among
these achievements are our impressive science and technology. Indeed, whilst
it must be admitted that some of the fruits of this technology are of distinctly
questionable long-term (or short-term) value, as is borne witness by numerous
environmental problems and a genuine fear of a technology-induced global
catastrophe, it is this same technology that has given us our modern society,
with its comforts, its considerable freedoms from fear, disease, and need, and
with its vast opportunities for intellectual and aesthetic expansion, and for
mind-broadening global communication. If this technology has opened up so
many potentialities and, in a sense, increased the scope and the power of our
individual physical selves, can we not expect much more in the future?
   Our senses have been vastly extended by our technology, both ancient and
modern. Our sight has been aided and enormously increased in power by
spectacles, mirrors, telescopes, microscopes of all kinds, and by video­
cameras, television, and the like. Our hearing has been aided, originally by
ear-trumpets, but now by tiny electronic devices, and greatly extended by
telephones, radio communication, and satellites. We have bicycles, trains,
motor cars, ships, and aeroplanes to aid and transcend our natural forms of
locomotion. Our memories are helped by printed books, films-and by the
huge storage capacities of electronic computers. Our calculational tasks,
whether simple and routine, or of a massive or sophisticated kind, are also
vastly extended by the capabilities of modern computers. Thus, not only does
our technology provide us with an enormous expansion of the scope of our
physical selves, but it also expands our mental capabilities by greatly
improving upon our abilities to perform many routine tasks. What about
mental tasks that are not routine-tasks that require genuine intelligence? It is
natural to ask whether these also will be aided by our computer-driven
technology.
   There is little doubt in my own mind that there is indeed, implicit in our
(frequently computer-driven) technological society, at least one direction with
an enormous potential for enhancing intelligence. I refer, here, to the
educational possibilities of our society, which could gain great benefit from
diferent aspects of technology-but only if it is used with sensitivity and
understanding. Technology provides the potential, by use of well-produced
books, film, television, and interactive computer-controlled systems of various
kinds. These, and other developments, provide many opportunities for
expanding our minds-or else for deadening them. The human mind is
lO                            Consciousness and computation

capable of vastly more than it is often given the chance to achieve. Sadly, these
opportunities are all too frequently squandered, and the minds of neither
young nor old are provided the openings that they undoubtedly deserve.
   But many readers will ask: is there not a rather different possibility for the
vast expansion of a mental capability, namely that alien electronic 'intelli­
gence' which is just beginning to emerge from the extraordinary advances in
computer technology? Indeed, we already frequently turn to computers for
intellectual assistance. There are many circumstances in which unaided
human intelligence is far from adequate to assess the probable consequences of
alternative actions. Such consequences may lie considerably beyond the scope
of human computational powers; thus it is to be expected that the computers
of the future will greatly expand this role, where hard computational fact
provides an invaluable aid to human intelligence.
   Yet may not computers eventually achieve very much more than just this?
Many experts claim that computers offer us, at least in principle, the potential
for an artificial intelligence that will ultimately exceed our own. 1 When
computationally controlled robots reach the level of 'human equivalence',
then it will not take long, they argue, before they race enormously beyond our
own puny level. Only then, these experts would claim, shall we have an
authority with sufficient intelligence, wisdom, and understanding to be able to
resolve the troubles of this world that humanity has created.
   How long will it be before this happy state of affairs is to come about? There
is no clear consensus among these experts. Some would measure the timescale
in terms of many centuries, whilst others claim that this human equivalence is
just decades away. 2 The latter would point to the very rapid 'exponential'
growth of computer power and base their estimates upon comparisons
between the speed and accuracy of transistors, and the relative slowness and
sloppy action of neurons. Indeed, electronic circuits are already over a million
times faster than the firing of the neurons in the brain (the rate being some
 10 9/s for transistors and only about 10 3/s for neurons * ), and they have an
immense precision in timing and accuracy of action that is in no way shared by
neurons. Moreover, there is a great deal of randomness in the brain's 'wiring'
that, it wbuld seem, could be vastly improved upon by the deliberate and
precise organization of electronic printed circuits.
    There are some areas where the neuron structure ofthe brain does provide a
numerical advantage over present-day computers, although these advantages
might be relatively short lived. It is argued that in total neuron number (some
hundreds of thousands of millions), human brains are at the moment ahead of
computers with respect to their transistor counts. Moreover, on the average,
 there are a good deal more connections between different neurons than there

         *The Intel Pentium chip has over three million transistors on a 'slice of silicon'
      about the size of a thumbnail, each capable of performing 1 1 3 million full
      instructions per second.
                          Consciousness and computation                        11

are connections between transistors in a computer. In particular, Purkinje
cells in the cerebellum can have up to 80 000 synaptic endings (junctions
between neurons), whereas for a computer, the corresponding number is only
about three or four at most. (I shall have some comments to make about the
cerebellum later; cf. §1 . 14, §8.6.) Moreover, most of the transistors of today's
computers are concerned just with memory and not directly with
computational action, whereas it might be the case that with the brain such
computational action could be more widespread.
   These temporary advantages for the brain could easily be overcome in the
future, particularly when massively 'parallel' computational systems become
more developed. It is to a computer's advantage that different units can be
combined together to form larger and larger ones, so the total number of
transistors could, in principle, be increased almost without limit. In addition,
there are technological revolutions waiting in the wings, such as the replacing
of the wires and transistors of our present computers by appropriate optical
(laser) devices, perhaps achieving, thereby, enormous increases in speed,
power, and miniaturization. More fundamentally, our brains would appear to
be stuck with the numbers that we have at present, and we have many further
constraints, such as having to grow from a single cell. Computers, on the other
hand, can be deliberately constructed so as to achieve all that is eventually
needed. Though I shall later be pointing to some important factors that are not
yet being taken into account by these considerations (most particularly, a
significant level of activity that underlies that of neurons), an impressive­
looking case can indeed be made that on any issue of merely computing power,
if computers do not have the advantage over brains already, then they will
certainly have it before too long.
   Thus, if we are to believe the strongest of the claims of the most outspoken of
the proponents of artificial intelligence, and accept that computers and
computer-guided robots will eventually-and even perhaps before too long­
exceed all human capabilities, then the computers will be able to do
immeasurably more than merely assist our intelligences. They will actually
have immense intelligences of their own. We could then turn to these superior
intelligences for advice and authority in all matters of concern-and the
humanity-induced troubles of the world could at last be resolved!
   But there appears to be another logical consequence of these potential
developments that may well strike us as genuinely alarming. Would not these
computers eventually make human beings themselves superfluous? If the
computer-guided robots turn out to be our superiors in every respect, then will
they not find that they can run the world better without the need of us at all?
Humanity itself will then have become obsolete. Perhaps, if we are lucky, they
might keep us as pets, as Edward Fredkin once said; or if we are clever, we
might be able to transfer the 'patterns of information' that are 'ourselves' into
robot form, as Hans Moravec (1988) has insisted; or perhaps we will not be
that lucky and will just not be that clever . . .
12                        Consciousness and computation


     1 .3 The d, f!J, Cff, f!fi, of computation and conscious
                                 thinking
But are the relevant issues merely those of computing power, or of speed,
accuracy, or memory, or perhaps of the detailed way in which things happen to
be 'wired up'? Might we, on the other hand, be doing something with our
brains that cannot be described in computational terms at all? How do our
feelings of conscious awareness-of happiness, pain, love, aesthetic sensibility,
will, understanding, etc.-fit into such a computational picture? Will the
computers of the future actually have minds? Does the presence of a conscious
mind actually influence behaviour in any way? Does it make sense to talk
about such things in scientific terms at all; or is science in no way competent to
address issues that relate to the human consciousness?
   It seems to me that there are at least four different viewpoints 3-or extremes
of viewpoint-that one may reasonably hold on the matter:
d.    All thinking is computation; in particular, feelings of conscious awareness
      are evoked merely by the carrying out of appropriate computations.
81. Awareness is a feature of the brain's physical action; and whereas any
     physical action can be simulated computationally, computational simula­
     tion cannot by itself evoke awareness.
!fl. Appropriate physical action of the brain evokes awareness, but this
     physical action cannot even be properly simulated computationally.
�. Awareness cannot be explained by physical, computational, or any other
     scientific terms.
   The point of view expressed in �. which negates the physicalist position
altogether and regards the mind as something that is entirely inexplicable in
scientific terms, is the viewpoint of the mystic; and at least some ingredient of
� seems to be involved in the acceptance of religious doctrine. My own
position is that questions of mind, though they lie very uncomfortably with
present-day scientific understanding, should not be regarded as being forever
outside the realms of science. If science is yet incapable of saying much that is
of significance concerning matters of the mind, then eventually science must
enlarge its scope so as to accommodate such matters, and perhaps even modify
its very procedures. Whereas I reject mysticism in its negation of scientific
criteria for the furtherance of knowledge, I believe that within an expanded
science and mathematics there will be found sufficient mystery ultimately to
accommodate even the mystery of mind. I shall expand on some of these ideas
later on in this book, but for the moment it will be sufficient to say that I am
rejecting�; and I am attempting to move forward along the path that science
has set out for us. If you are a reader who believes strongly that �. in some
form, must be right, I ask that you bear with me and see how far we can get
                          Consciousness and computation                        13

along the scientific road-and try to perceive where I believe that this road
must ultimately be taking us.
   Let us consider what seems to be the other extreme: the viewpoint d. Those
who adhere to the standpoint that is often referred to as strong AI (strong
Artificial Intelligence) or sometimes hard AI, or functionalism,4 would come
under this heading-although some people might use the term 'functionalism'
in a way that could include certain versions of</&' also. d is regarded by some as
the only viewpoint that an entirely scientific attitude allows. Others would
take d to be an absurdity that is barely worth serious attention. There are
undoubtedly many different versions of viewpoint d. (See Sloman (1992) for a
long list of alternative computational viewpoints.) Some of these might differ
with regard to what kind of thing would be counted as a 'computation' or as
'carrying out' a computation. Indeed, there are also adherents of d who
would deny that they are 'strong AI supporters' at all, because they claim to
take a different view as to the interpretation of the term 'computation' from
that of conventional AI (cf. Edelman 1992). I shall address these issues a little
more fully in §1 .4. For the moment it will be sufficient to take these terms
simply to mean the kind of thing that ordinary general-purpose computers are
capable of doing. Other proponents of d might differ as to how they interpret
the meaning of the words 'awareness' or 'consciousness'. Some would not even
allow that there is such a phenomenon as 'conscious awareness' at all, whereas
others would accept the existence of this phenomenon, but regard it as just
some kind of 'emergent property' (cf. also §4.3 and §4.4) that comes along
whenever a sufficient degree of complication (or sophistication, or self­
reference, or whatever) is involved in the computation that is being performed.
I shall indicate my own interpretation of the terms 'consciousness' and
'awareness' in §1 . 12. Just for now, any differences in possible interpretation
will not be greatly important for our considerations.
   The strong-A! viewpoint d is what my arguments in ENM were most
specifically directed against. The length of that book alone should make it
clear that, while I do not myself believe that d is correct, I do regard it as a
serious possibility that is worthy of considerable attention. d is an implication
of a highly operational attitude to science, where, also, the physical world is
taken to operate entirely computationally. In one extreme of this view, the
universe itself is taken to be, in effect, a gigantic computer; 5 and appropriate
subcomputations that this computer performs will evoke the feelings of
'awareness' that constitute our conscious minds.
   I suppose that this viewpoint-that physical systems are to be regarded as
merely computational entities-stems partly from the powerful and increasing
role that computational simulations play in modern twentieth-century
science, and also partly from a belief that physical objects are themselves
merely 'patterns of information', in some sense, that are subject to
computational mathematical laws. Most of the material of our bodies and
brains, after all, is being continuously replaced, and it is just its pattern that
14                         Consciousness and computation

persists. Moreover, matter itself seems to have merely a transient existence
since it can be converted from one form into another. Even the mass of a
material body, which provides a precise physical measure of the quantity of
matter that the body contains, can in appropriate circumstances be converted
into pure energy (according to Einstein's famous E = mc 2 )---s o even material
substance seems to be able to convert itself into something with a mere
theoretical mathematical actuality. Furthermore, quantum theory seems to
tell us that material particles are merely 'waves' of information. (We shall
examine these issues more thoroughly in Part II.) Thus, matter itself is
nebulous and transient; and it is not at all unreasonable to suppose that the
persistence of 'self might have more to do with the preservation of patterns
than of actual material particles.
   Even if we do not think that it is appropriate to regard the universe as simply
being a computer, we may feel ourselves operationally driven to viewpoint d.
Suppose that we have a robot that is controlled by a computer and which
responds to questioning exactly as a human would. We ask it how it feels, and
find that it answers in a way that is entirely consistent with its actually
possessing feelings. It tells us that it is aware, that it is happy or sad, that it can
perceive the colour red, and that it worries about questions of'mind' and 'self.
It may even give expression to a puzzlement about whether or not it should
accept that other beings (especially human beings) are to be regarded as
possessing a consciousness similar to the one that it claims to feel itself. Why
should we disbelieve its claims to be aware, to wonder, to be joyful, or to feel
pain, when it might seem that we have as little to go on with respect to other
human beings whom we do accept as being conscious? The operational
argument does, it seems to me, have some considerable force, even if it is not
entirely conclusive. If all the external manifestations of a conscious brain,
including responses to continual questioning, can indeed be completely
imitated by a system entirely under computational control, then there would
indeed be a plausible case for accepting that its internal manifestations­
consciousness itself-should be also considered to be present in association
with such a simulation.
   The acceptance of this kind of argument, which basically is what is referred
to as a Turing test,6 is in essence what distinguishes d from !14. According to
d, any computer-controlled robot which, after sustained questioning,
convincingly behaves as though it possesses consciousness, must be considered
actually to be conscious-whereas according to !14, a robot could perfectly well
behave exactly as a conscious person might behave without itself actually
possessing any of this mental quality. Both d and !14 would allow that a
computer-controlled robot could convincingly behave as a conscious person
does, but viewpoint rc, on the other hand, would not even admit that a fully
effective simulation of a conscious person could ever be achieved merely by a
computer-controlled robot. Thus, according to rc, the robot's actual lack of
consciousness ought ultimately to reveal itself, after a sufficiently long
                           Consciousness and computation                          15

interrogation. Indeed, 'II is much more of an operational viewpoint than is f!J­
and it is more like .91 than f!J in this particular respect.
   What about f!J then? I think that it is perhaps the viewpoint that many
would regard as 'scientific common sense'. lt is sometimes referred to as weak
(or soft) AI. Like .9/, it affirms a view that all the physical objects of this world
must behave according to a science that, in principle, allows that they can be
computationally simulated. On the other hand, it strongly denies the
operational claim that a thing that behaves externally as a conscious being
must necessarily be conscious itself. As the philosopher John Searle has
stressed, 7 a computational simulation of a physical process is a very different
thing from the actual process itself. (A computer simulation of a hurricane, for
example, is certainly no hurricane!) On view f!8, the presence or absence of
consciousness would depend very much upon what actual physical object is
'doing the thinking', and upon what particular physical actions that object is
performing. It would be a secondary matter to consider the particular
computations that might happen to be involved in these actions. Thus, the
action of a biological brain might evoke consciousness, whilst its accurate
electronic simulation might well not. It is not necessary, in viewpoint f!J, for
this distinction to be between biology and physics. But the actual material
constitution of the object in question (say, a brain), and not just its
computational action, is regarded as all-important.
   The viewpoint 'II is the one which I believe myself to be closest to the truth. lt
is more of an operational viewpoint than f!J since it asserts that there are
external manifestations of conscious objects (say, brains) that differ from the
external manifestations of a computer: the outward effects of consciousness
cannot be properly simulated computationally. I shall be giving my reasons
for this belief in due course. Since 'II, like f!J, goes along with the physicalist
standpoint that minds arise as manifestations of the behaviour of certain
physical objects (brains-although not necessarily only brains), it follows that
an implication of 'II is that not all physical action can be properly simulated
computationally.
   Does present-day physics allow for the possibility of an action that is in
principle impossible to simulate on a computer? The answer is not completely
clear to me, if we are asking for a mathematically rigorous statement. Rather
less is known than one would like, in the way of precise mathematical
theorems, on this issue.8 However, my own strong opinion is that such
non-computational action would have to be found in an area of physics that
lies outside the presently known physical laws. Later on in this book, I shall
reiterate some of the powerful reasons, coming from within physics itself, for
believing that a new understanding is indeed needed, in an area that lies
intermediate between the 'small-scale' level, where quantum laws hold sway,
and the 'everyday' level of classical physics. However, it is not by any means
universally accepted, among present-day physicists, that such a new physical
theory is required.
16                        Consciousness and ·computation

   Thus there are at least two very different standpoints that could come under
the heading of CC. Some CC-believers would contend that our present physical
understanding is perfectly adequate, and that we should look to subtle types of
behaviour within conventional theory that might be able to take us outside the
scope of what can be achieved entirely computationally (e.g. as we shall
examine later: chaotic behaviour ( §1 .7), subtleties of continuous as opposed to
discrete action (§1 .8), quantum randomness). On the other hand, there are
those who would argue that the physics oftoday really offers us no reasonable
scope for non-computability of the type needed. Later in this book I shall give
what I believe are powerful reasons for adopting CC according to this stronger
standpoint-which requires some fundamentally new physics to be involved.
   Some people have tried to contend that this really places me in camp �.
since I am arguing that we must look beyond the reaches of known science if
we are ever to find any kind of explanation of the phenomenon of
consciousness. But there is an essential difference between this strong version
of CC and the viewpoint .@-particularly with regard to the issue of
methodology. According to CC, the problem of conscious awareness is indeed a
scientific one, even if the appropriate science may not yet be at hand. I strongly
support this viewpoint; I believe that it must indeed be by the methods of
science-albeit appropriately extended in ways that we can perhaps only
barely glimpse at present-that we must seek our answers. That is the key
difference between fC and £d, whatever similarities there may seem to be in the
corresponding opinions as to what present-day science is capable of achieving.
   The viewpoints .91, !JI, rc, �. as defined above, are intended to represent
extremes, or polarities, of possible stances that one might choose to take. I can
accept that some people may feel that their own viewpoints do not fit clearly
into any of these categories, but perhaps lie somewhere between them, or cut
across some of them. There are certainly many possible gradations of belief
between .91 and !JI, for example (see Sloman 1992). There is even a view, not
uncommonly expressed, that might best be regarded as a combination of .91
and £d (or perhaps fJI and £d)-a possibility that will actually feature
significantly in our later deliberations. According to this view, the brain's
action is indeed that of a computer, but it is a computer of such wonderful
complexity that its imitation is beyond the wit of man and science, being
necessarily a divine creation of God-the 'best programmer in the business' ! 9


                   1 .4 Physicalism vs . mentalism
I should make a brief remark about the use of the words 'physicalist' and
'mentalist' that are often used to describe opposing standpoints in connection
with the issues addressed by .91, Bl, CC, and .@. Since � represents a total denial
of physicalism, believers in £d would certainly have to be counted as
mentalists. However, it is not at all clear to me where the line between
                          Consciousness and computation                        17

physicalism and mentalism is to be drawn in relation to the other three
viewpoints .J/1, fJI, and �. I think that holders of viewpoint d would normally
be thought of as physicalists, and I am sure that the vast majority of them
would say so. However, there is something of a paradox lurking here.
According to d, the material construction of a thinking device is regarded as
irrelevant. It is simply the computation that it performs that determines all its
mental attributes. Computations themselves are pieces of abstract mathe­
matics, divorced from any association with particular material bodies. Thus,
according to .J/1, mental attributes are themselves things with no particular
association with physical objects, so the term 'physicalist' might seem a little
inappropriate. Viewpoints fJI and �. on the other hand, demand that the
actual physical constitution of an object must indeed be playing a vital role in
determining whether or not there is genuine mentality present in association
with it. Accordingly, it might well be argued that these, rather than .J/1,
represent the possible physicalist standpoints. However, it seems that such
terminology would be at variance with some common usage, the term
'mentalist' being often regarded as more appropriate for fJI and �, since here
mental qualities are regarded as being 'real things' and not just as
'epiphenomena' that might arise incidentally when (certain types of)
computations are performed. In view of such confusions, I shall tend to avoid
the use of the terms 'physicalist' and 'mentalist' in the discussions that follow,
and refer, instead, to the specific viewpoints d, fJI, �, and � as defined above.


        1 , 5 Computation : top-down and bottom-up
                                 procedures
I have not been at all explicit, thus far, about what I am taking the term
'computation' to mean, in the definitions of d, fJI, �. and �. of §1 .3. What is a
computation? In short, one can simply understand that term to denote the
activity of an ordinary general-purpose computer. To be more precise, we
must take this in a suitably idealized sense: a computation is the action of a
 Turing machine.
    But what is a Turing m�chine? It is, indeed, a mathematically idealized
computer (the theoretical forerunner of the modem general-purpose com­
puter)--idealized so that it never makes any mistakes and can run on for as
long as is necessary, and so that it has an unlimited storage space. I shall be a
little more explicit about how Turing machines may be precisely specified in
 §2.1 and Appendix A (p. 1 17). (For a much more thorough introduction, the
interested reader is referred to the descriptions given in ENM, Chapter 2, or
else to Kleene (1952) or Davis (1978), for example.)
   The term 'algorithm' is frequently used to describe the action of a Turing
machine. I am taking 'algorithm' to be completely synonymous with
'computation' here. This needs a little clarification, because some people take
18                          Consciousness and computation

a more restrictive point of view with regard to the term 'algorithm' than I am
proposing to do here, taking it in the sense of what I shall refer more
specifically to as a 'top-down algorithm'. Let us try to understand what the
terms 'top-down' and its antithesis 'bottom-up' are to mean in the context of
computation.
   A computational procedure is said to have a top-down organization if it has
been constructed according to some well-defined and clearly understood fixed
computational procedure (which may include some preassigned store of
knowledge), where this procedure specifically provides a clear-cut solution to
some problem at hand. (Euclid's algorithm for finding the highest common
factor* of two natural numbers, as described in ENM, p. 3 1 , is a simple
example of a top-down algorithm.) This is to be contrasted with a bottom-up
organization, where such clearly defined rules of operation and knowledge
store are not specified in advance, but instead there is a procedure laid down
for the way that the system is to 'learn' and to improve its performance
according to its 'experience'. Thus, with a bottom-up system, these rules of
operation are subject to continual modification. One must allow that the
system is to be run many times, performing its actions upon a continuing input
of data. On each run, an assessment is made-perhaps by the system itself­
and it modifies its operations, in the light of this assessment, with a view to
improving this quality of output. For example, the input data for the system
might be a number of photographs of human faces, appropriately digitized,
and the system's task is to decide which photographs represent the same
individuals and which do not. After each run, the system's performance is
compared with the correct answers. Its rules of operation are then modified in
such a way as to lead to a probable improvement in its performance on the
next run.
   The details of how this improvement is to be arranged, in any particular
bottom-up system, are not important for us here. There are many different
possible schemes. Among the best-known systems of bottom-up type are the
so-called artificial neural networks (sometimes referred to, a little misleadingly,
simply as 'neural networks' or 'neural nets') which are computer learning
programs-or else specifically constructed electronic devices-that are based
upon certain ideas about how the organization of a system of connections of
neurons in the brain is thought to be improved as that system gains its
experience. (The question of how the brain's system. of neuron interconnec­
tions actually modifies itself will be an important one for us later; cf. §7.4 and
 §7.7.) It is clearly also possible to have computer systems that combine
elements of both top-down and bottom-up organizations.
   The important thing for our purposes here is that both top-down and
bottom-up computational procedures are things that can be put on a general­
purpose computer and are therefore both to be included under the heading of
        *To American readers: this is the 'greatest common divisor', or 'GCD'.
                          Consciousness and computation                         19

what I am referring to as computational and algorithmic. Thus, with the
bottom-up (or combined) systems, the way in which the system modifies its
procedures is itself provided by something entirely computational which is
specified ahead of time. This is the reason that the entire system can indeed be
implemented on an ordinary computer. The essential difference between a
bottom-up (or combined) system and a top-down one lies in the fact that with
bottom-up systems, the computational procedure must contain a 'memory' of
its previous performance ('experience'), so that this memory can be
incorporated into its subsequent computational actions. For the moment, the
details of this are not particularly important, but some further discussion will
be given in §3 . 1 1 .
   According to the aspirations of artificial intelligence (abbreviated 'AI'), one
strives to imitate intelligent behaviour, at whatever level, by some kind of
computational means. Here, both top-down and bottom-up organizations
have been frequently used. Originally it was the top-down systems that seemed
most promising, 1 0 but now bottom-up systems of the artificial neural network
type have become particularly popular. It would seem that it is in some kind of
combination of top-down and bottom-up organization that we must expect to
find the most successful AI systems. There are different kinds of advantage to
be gained from each. The successes with top-down organization tend to be in
areas in which the data and the operational rules are clearly delineated and of a
very well-defined computational kind, such as with certain specific mathe­
matical problems or chess-playing computer systems or, say, with medical
diagnosis in which sets of rules are given for diagnosing different diseases,
based on accepted medical procedures. The bottom-up organization tends to
be useful when the criteria for decisions are not very precise or are ill­
understood, such as with the recognition of faces or sounds, or perhaps in
prospecting for mineral deposits, where the improvement of performance by
experience is the basic behavioural criterion. In many such cases, there could
actually be elements of both top-down and bottom-up organization (such as
with a chess computer that learns from its experiences, or where some clear-cut
theoretical geological understanding is incorporated in a computational
device aiding the search for mineral deposits).
   I think it would be fair to say that only with certain instances of top-down
(or primarily top-down) organization have computers exhibited a significant
superiority over humans. The most obvious example is in straightforward
numerical calculation, where computers would now win hands down-and
also in 'computational' games, such as chess or draughts (checkers), and where
there may be only a very few human players able to beat the best machines
(more about this in § 1 . 1 5 and §8.2). With bottom-up (artificial neural
network) organization, the computers can, in a few limited instances, reach
about the level of ordinary well-trained humans.
   Another distinction between different kinds of computer systems is that
which differentiates the serial from the parallel architecture. A serial machine is
20                        Consciousness and computation

one that does its computations one after the other, in a step-by-step action,
whereas a parallel one does many independent computations simultaneously,
the results of these different computations being brought together only when
appropriately many of them have been completed. Again, theories about how
the brain might operate have been instrumental in the development of certain
parallel systems. It should be emphasized, however, that there is not really a
distinction of principle between serial and parallel machines. It is always
possible to simulate parallel action serially, even though there are some kinds
of problem (but by no means all) for which a parallel action can solve the
problem more efficiently, in terms of computing time, etc., than a serial one
can. Since I shall be concerned here mainly with matters of principle, the
distinctions between parallel and serial computation will not be of much
relevance to us.


    1 .6 Does viewpoint CC violate the Church-Turing
                                     thesis?
Recall that according to viewpoint CC the conscious brain is supposed to act in
a way that is beyond computational simulation, whether top-down, or
bottom-up, or whatever. Some people, in expressing their doubts about CC,
might partially base these doubts on an assertion that CC would contradict the
(generally believed) so-called Church thesis (or Church-Turing thesis). What
is Church's thesis? In its original form, put forward by the American logician
Alonzo Church in 1936, it asserted that anything that could reasonably be
called a 'purely mechanical' mathematical process-i.e. anything algorith­
mic�ould be achieved within a particular scheme discovered by Church
himself, called the lambda calculus (A.-calculus ) 1 1 (a scheme of very consider­
able elegance and economy of concept; see ENM pp. 66-70 for a brief
introductory account). Shortly afterwards, in 1936/7, the British mathemati­
cian Alan Turing found his own much more persuasive way of describing
algorithmic processes, in terms of the action of theoretical 'computing
machines' that we now call Turing machines. The Polish-born American
logician Emil Post (1936) also developed a somewhat similar scheme to
Turing's a little afterwards. Church's calculus was soon shown, by Church and
by Turing separately, to be equivalent to Turing's (and hence also Post's)
concept of a Turing machine. M oreover, modem general-purpose computers
arose, to a considerable extent, out of Turing's very conceptions. As
mentioned above, a Turing machine is, in fact, completely equivalent, in its
action, to that of a modem computer-with the specific idealization that the
computer must in principle have access to an unlimited storage capacity.
Thus, the original Church's thesis is now seen simply to assert that
mathematical algorithms are precisely the things that can be carried out by an
idealized modem computer-which, with the definition of the word 'algor-
                              Consciousness and computation                                  21

ithm' that is now usually adopted, becomes mere tautology. There is certainly
no contradiction with rc involved in accepting this form of Church's thesis. *
   It is, however, probable that Turing himself had something further in mind:
that the computational capabilities of any physical device must (in idealiza­
tion) be equivalent to the action of a Turing machine. Such an assertion would
go well beyond what Church seems originally to have intended. Turing's own
motivations for the development of the concept of 'Turing machine' were
based on his ideas of what a human calculator might be able to achieve in
principle (see Hodges 1983). It seems likely that he viewed physical action in
general-which would include the action of a human brain-to be always
reducible to some kind of Turing-machine action. Perhaps one should call this
(physical) assertion 'Turing's thesis', in order to distinguish it from the original
(purely mathematical) assertion of 'Church's thesis', which is in no way
contradicted by rc. This, indeed, is the terminology that I shall adopt in this
book. Accordingly, it is this Turing's thesis, not Church's thesis, that would be
contradicted by viewpoint rc.


                                  1 .7 Chaos
There has been a great deal of interest, in recent years, in the mathematical
phenomenon that goes under the name of'chaos', where physical systems seem
to be able to behave in wild and unpredictable ways (Fig. 1 . 1 ). Does the
phenomenon of chaos provide the needed non-computable physical basis for a
viewpoint of the nature of flf?
   Chaotic systems are dynamically evolving physical systems, or mathe­
matical simulations of such physical systems, or just mathematical models
studied for their own sake, in which the future behaviour of the system depends
extremely critically upon the precise initial state of the system. Although
ordinary chaotic systems are completely deterministic and computational,
they can, in practice, behave as though they are not deterministic at all. This is
because the accuracy according to which the initial state needs to be known,
for a deterministic prediction of its future behaviour, can be totally beyond
anything that is conceivably measurable.
   An example that is often quoted in this connection is the detailed long-range
prediction of the weather. The laws governing the motion of air molecules, and
also of the other physical quantities that might be relevant to computing the
         *It sometimes arises, in some mathematical discussion, that a procedure is
      encountered that is 'obviously' algorithmic in nature, even though it may not be at
      all immediate how to formulate that procedure in the form of a Turing-machine or
      lambda-calculus operation. In such cases, one may assert that such an operation
      must indeed exist 'by Church's thesis'. See Cutland (1980), for example. There is
      nothing wrong with proceeding in this way, and there is certainly no contradiction
      with ((/ involved. In fact, this kind of use of Church's thesis pervades much of the
      discussion of Chapter 3 .
22                             Consciousness and computation




      Fig. 1 . 1 . The Lorentz attractor-an early example of a chaotic system. By
      following the lines, one moves from the left-hand lobe to the right-hand
      one and back again in a seemingly random fashion, and which lobe one
      finds oneself in at a given moment depends critically on the starting point.
      Yet the curve is defined by a simple mathematical (differential) equation.


weather, are all perfectly well known. However, the weather patterns that may
actually emerge, after only a few days, depend so subtly on the precise initial
conditions that there is no possibility of measuring these conditions accurately
enough for reliable prediction. Of course the number of parameters that would
have to enter into such a computation would be enormous, so it is perhaps not
surprising that prediction, in this case, might prove to be virtually impossible in
practice.
   On the other hand, such so-called chaotic behaviour can occur also with very
simple systems, such as those consisting of only a small number of particles.
Imagine, for example, that you are asked to pocket the fifth snooker ball E in a
crooked * and very well-spaced-out chain A, B, C, D, E, by hitting A with the cue
so that A hits B, causing B to hit C, then C to hit D, and finally D to hit E into the
pocket. The accuracy needed for this is, in general, far in excess of the abilities of
any expert snooker player. If there were 20 in the chain, then even if the balls
were perfectly elastic exact spheres, the task of potting the final ball would be far
beyond the most accurate machinery of modem technology. In effect, the
behaviour of the later balls in the chain would be random, despite the fact that
the Newtonian laws governing the behaviour of the balls is mathematically
completely deterministic and in principle effectively computable. No compu­
tation could predict the actual behaviour of the later balls in the chain, simply
because there would be no way of determining enough accuracy for the actual
         *In an earlier draft of this book I had not included the word 'crooked' here. If the
      balls are all precisely arranged in a straight line, then the feat turns out to be quite
      easy, as I learned to my surprise when testing things myself. There is a fortuitous
      stability that occurs with precise alignment, but this does not hold in the general
      case.
                            Consciousness and computation                            23

initial position and velocity of the cue or of the positions of the earlier balls in the
chain. Moreover, even tiny external effects, such as the breathing of someone in
the next town, might disturb this accuracy so much to render any such
computation useless.
   I should make it clear that despite such profound difficulties for deterministic
prediction, all the normal systems that are referred to as 'chaotic' are to be
included in what I call 'computational'. Why is this? As in other situations that
we shall be coming to later, all we need to do, in order to decide that a procedure
is computational, is to ask: can it be put on an ordinary general-purpose
computer? Clearly the answer must be 'yes' in this case, simply for the reason
that mathematically described chaotic systems are indeed normally studied by
putting them on a computer!
   Of course if we try to perform a computational simulation predicting the
detailed weather patterns ovc::r Europe for the course of a week, or the successive
collisions of 20 unaligned well-separated snooker balls after a swift stroke of the
cue, then our simulation is almost certainly not going to resemble at all closely
what actually happens. This is . in the nature of chaotic systems. It is not
practicable to predict computationally the actual outcome of the system.
Nevertheless, a simulation of a typical outcome is perfectly achievable. The
predicted weather may well not be the weather that actually occurs, but it is
perfectly plausible as a weather! Likewise, the predicted outcome of the snooker
ball collisions is completely acceptable as a possible outcome, even though in
fact the snooker balls may well tum out to do something quite different from
what is computed-but something quite equally acceptable. One further point
that emphasizes the perfectly computational nature of these operations is that if
the computer simulation is rerun, using just the same input data as before, then
the outcome of the simulation is precisely the same as it was before! (This
assumes that the computer itself makes no error; but in any case modem
computers only very rarely make actual computational errors.)
   In the context of artificial intelligence, one is not, after all, trying to simulate
the behaviour of any particular individual; one would be very satisfied with the
simulation just of an individual! Thus, it is not at all unreasonable to take the
view that I am indeed taking: that chaotic systems should certainly be included
in what we call 'computational'. A computer simulation of such a system would
indeed act out a perfectly reasonable 'typical case', even though it might not tum
out to be any 'actual case'. If the external manifestations of human intelligence
are the results of some chaotic dynamical evolution-an evolution that is
computational in the sense just described-then this would be in accordance
with viewpoints d and Pi�, but not �.
   From time to time, it has been suggested that this phenomenon of chaos, if it
occurs in the internal action of a physical brain, might be what enables our
brains to behave in ways that appear to differ from the computably deterministic
activity of a Turing machine even though, as emphasized above, it is technically
computational. I shall need to come back to this issue later (cf� §3.22). For the
24                        Consciousness and computation

moment, all that needs to be made clear is that chaotic systems are included in
what I mean by 'computational' or 'algorithmic'. The question of whether or not
something can be simulated in practice is a separate one from the in principle
issues that are under consideration here.


                      1 .8 Analogue computation
So far, I have been considering 'computation' only in the sense in which that
term applies to modern digital computers or, more accurately, to their
theoretical forerunners: the Turing machines. There are other types of
computational device that have been used, particularly in the past, in which
the operations are not represented in terms of the discrete 'on/off states that
are familiar in digital computations, but in terms of continuous physical
parameters. The most familiar of such devices is the slide rule, where the
physical parameter is linear distance (along the slide rule). This distance is
used to represent the logarithms of the numbers that are to be multiplied or
divided. There are many different types of analogue computational device, and
other kinds of physical parameter can be used, such as time, mass, or electric
potential.
   With analogue systems we have to confront the technical point that the
standard notions of computation and computability apply, strictly speaking,
only to discrete systems (which is what 'digital' operation is concerned with)
and not to the continuous ones, like distances or electric potentials, say, that
are involved in conventional classical physical theory. In order to apply the
ordinary notions of computation to a system whose description requires
continuous rather than discrete (or 'digital') parameters, therefore, it is natural
to resort to approximations. Indeed, in computer simulations of physical
systems generally, it is the normal procedure to approximate all the continuous
parameters under consideration in this discrete way. There would however, be
some error involved in doing this, and for a given selected degree of accuracy of
approximation, there could be physical systems of interest for which that
particular accuracy might not be enough. Accordingly, this discrete computer
simulation might lead to misleading conclusions as to the behaviour of the
continuous physical system that is being simulated.
   In principle, the accuracy could always be increased until that accuracy was
adequate for simulating the continuous system under consideration. How­
ever, particularly in the case of chaotic systems, the computation time and
memory store required might turn out to be prohibitive in practice. Moreover,
there is the technical point that one might never be absolutely certain when the
degree of accuracy that has been selected is sufficient. Some kind of test would
be needed to signal to us when the point has been reached where no more
accuracy is required, and the qualitative behaviour that is computed using
that level of accuracy can indeed be trusted. This raises a number of somewhat
                          Consciousness and computation                        25

delicate mathematical issues, and it would not be appropriate for me to enter
into them in detail here.
   There are, however, other approaches to the computational issues raised by
continuous systems, in which the systems are treated as mathematical
structures in their own right, with their own notion of 'computability'-a
notion which generalizes the idea of Turing computability from the discrete to
the continuous. 1 2 Using such a notion, it becomes unnecessary to approxi­
mate a continuous system by discrete parameters in order that the
conventional notion of Turing computability can be applied. Such ideas are
interesting from the mathematical point of view, but unfortunately they do not
seem to have achieved, as yet, the compelling naturalness and uniqueness that
applies to the standard notion of Turing computability for discrete systems.
Moreover, there are certain anomalies whereby a technical 'non-computabil­
ity' arises for simple systems where it is not clear that such a terminology is
really appropriate (e.g. even for the simple 'wave equation' of physics; cf. Pour­
el and Richards (198 1 ), ENM pp. 1 87-8). It should be mentioned, on the other
hand, that some fairly recent work (Rubel 1989) has shown that theoretical
analogue computers, belonging to a certain rather broad class, cannot reach
beyond ordinary Turing computability. I believe that these are interesting and
important matters which will be illuminated by further research. However it is
not clear to me that this body of work, as a whole, has yet reached the point
where it can be applied in a definitive way to the issues under discussion here.
   In this book I am specifically concerned with the question of the
computational nature of mental activity, where 'computational' is to be taken in
the normal sense of Turing computability. Ordinary present-day computers are
indeed digital in nature, and it is this that is relevant to today's AI activity.
Perhaps it is conceivable that, in the future, some different kind of 'computer'
might be introduced, that makes critical use of continuous physical para­
meters-albeit within the standard theoretical framework of today's physics­
enabling it to behave in a way that is essentially different from a digital
computer.
   However, these issues are of relevance mainly to the distinction between the
'strong' and 'weak' versions of viewpoint rc. According to the weak version oft'C,
there would have to be physical actions underlying the behaviour of the
conscious human brain that are non-computable in the standard sense of
discrete Turing computability, but which can be entirely understood in terms of
present-day physical theories. For this to be possible, it would appear that these
actions would have to depend upon continuous physical parameters in such a
way that they cannot be properly simulated by standard digital procedures.
According to the strong version oft'C, on the other hand, the non-computability
would have to come from some non-computable physical theory-as yet
undiscovered-whose implications are essential ingredients of conscious brain
action. Although this second possibility might seem far fetched, the alternative
(for t'C-supporters) is, indeed, to find a role for some continuous action from
26                        Consciousness and computation

amongst the known laws of physics, which cannot be properly simulated in any
computational way. However, the expectation for the moment must surely be
that, for any reliable analogue system of any type that has been seriously
envisaged to date, it would be possible-in principle at least-to provide an
effective digital simulation of it.
   Even apart from theoretical issues of this general kind, it is the digital
computers of today that hold most of the advantages over analogue ones.
Digital action is much more accurate, essentially for the reason that with digital
number storage, accuracy can be increased simply by increasing digit length,
which is easily achieved with only a modest (logarithmic) increase in the
computer's capacity; whereas for analogue machines (at least, for entirely
analogue ones, into which digital concepts are not imported), accuracy is
increased only by comparatively enormous (linear) increases in computer
capacity. It may be that new ideas will come along in the future that are to the
analogue machine's advantage, but with present-day technology, most of the
significant practical advantages seem to be very much on the side of digital
computation.


             1 .9 What kind of action could be non-
                                computational?
Most kinds of well-defined action that come to mind are, accordingly, things
which would have to be included under what I am referring to as
'computational' (meaning 'digital-computational'). The reader might begin to
worry that there is nothing reasonable left for the viewpoint � to operate with.
I have said nothing yet about strictly random actions, that might be provided,
say, by some input from a quantum system. (Quantum mechanics will be
discussed at some length in Part II, Chapters 5 and 6.) However, it is hard to
see what advantage to a system there might be in having a genuinely random
input, as opposed to a merely pseudo-random one that can be generated
entirely computationally (cf. §3.1 1 ). Indeed, altltough there are, strictly
speaking, some technical differences between 'random' and 'pseudo-random',
these differences would seem to be of no real relevance to the issues of AI. Later
on, in §3. 1 1 , §3.18 et seq., I shall give strong arguments to show that 'pure
randomness' indeed does nothing useful for us; if anything, it would be better
to stay with the pseudo-randomness of chaotic behaviour-and, as was
emphasized above, all the normal types of chaotic behaviour count as
'computational'.
   What about the role of the environment? As each individual human being
develops, he or she is provided with a unique environment, not shared by any
other human being. Might it not be the case that it is this unique personal
environment that gives each of us an input that is beyond computation?
However, I find it hard to see how the 'uniqueness' of our environment helps in
                          Consciousness and computation                        27

this context. The discussion is similar to that concerning chaos above
(cf. §1 .7). Provided that there is nothing beyond computation in the
simulation of a plausible (chaotic) environment, such a simulation is all that
would be needed for the training of a computer-controlled robot. The robot
does not need to learn its skills through any actual environment; a
computationally simulated typical (rather than actual) environment for the
robot would certainly suffice.
   Might it be that there is something inherently impossible in computation­
ally simulating even a plausible environment? Perhaps there is something in
the external physical world that is actually beyond computational simulation.
Some supporters of d or f!l might be inclined to attribute seemingly non­
computational acts of human behaviour to a lack of computability in that
external environment. It would be rash, however, for .91- or f!l-supporters to
rely upon such an argument. For once it is accepted that there might be
something somewhere in physical behaviour that cannot be simulated
computationally; this would undermine what is presumably the main reason
for doubting the plausibility of � in the first place. If there are actions in the
outside environment that lie beyond computational simulation, then why not
also internal to the brain? The internal physical organization of the human
brain, after all, appears to be far more sophisticated than most (at least) of its
environment--except, perhaps, where that environment is itself strongly
influenced by the actions of other human brains. The acceptance of external
non-computational physical action concedes the main case against �- (See
also the further discussion in §3.9, §3.10.)
   One further point should be made in connection with the notion of
something that might be 'beyond computation', as is required by �- I do not
simply mean something that is beyond practical computation. It could be
argued, on the other hand, that the simulation of any plausible environment,
or any accurate enactment of all the physical and chemical processes taking
place in a brain, might be something that though in principle computational
would take so much time to compute, or use so much memory space, that there
could be no prospect of the computation being carried out on any actual or
foreseeable computer. Perhaps the mere writing of an appropriate computer
program would simply be out of the question, owing to the large number of
different factors needed to be taken into account. Relevant though such
considerations may well be, however, (and they will be discussed in §2.6, QS,
and §3.5) they are not what I mean here by 'non-computable', as is required by
�- I mean, instead, something that is in principle beyond computation, in a
sense that I shall describe in a moment. Computations that are merely beyond
existing or foreseeable computers, or computational techniques, are still
'computations' in the technical sense.
   The reader may well ask: if there is nothing that counts as 'non­
computational' in randomness or in environmental influences, or in sheer
unmanageable complication, then what can I possibly have in mind by use of
28                         Consciousness and computation

this term-as is required for viewpoint �? What I have in mind rests on certain
types of mathematically precise activity that can be proved to be beyond
computation. As far as is yet known, no such mathematical activity is needed
to describe physical behaviour. Nevertheless, it is a logical possibility.
Moreover, it is not just a logical possibility. According to the arguments of this
book, something of this general nature must be inherent in physical laws,
despite the fact that such things have not yet been encountered in known
physics. Certain instances of this kind of mathematical activity are remarkably
simple, so it will be appropriate to illustrate what I have in mind in terms of
these.
    I shall need to start by describing some examples of classes of well-defined
mathematical problems that-in a sense I shall explain in a moment-have no
general computational solution. Starting with any such class of problem, it
will be possible to construct a 'toy model' of a physical universe whose action,
though entirely deterministic, is actually beyond computational simulation.
The first example of such a class of problems is the most famous of all: that
known as 'Hilbert's tenth problem', which was put forward by the great
German mathematician David Hilbert in 1900, as one of a list of then
unanswered mathematical questions that set much of the stage for the
subsequent development of mathematics in the early (and even late) twentieth
century. Hilbert's tenth problem was to find a computational procedure for
deciding, for a given system of Diophantine equations, whether the equations
have any common solution.
    What are Diophantine equations? They are polynomial equations, in any
number of variables, for which all the coefficients and all the solutions must be
integers. (An integer is just a whole number: one of the list . . , - 3, - 2, - 1, 0,
                                                                  .



 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .. Diophantine equations were first systematically studied by the
Greek mathematician Diophantos in the third century AD.) An example of a
system of Diophantine equations is
        6w + 2x 2 - y 3 = 0, 5xy - z 2 + 6 = 0, w 2 - w + 2x - y + z - 4 = 0.
And another example is


The first system is solved, in particular, by
                             W = 1 , X = 1 , y = 2, z = 4,
whereas the second system has no solution whatever (because, by its first
equation, y must be an even number whence, by its second, z must be even
also, but this contradicts its third equation, whatever w is, because w 2 - w is
always even, and 3 is an odd number). The problem posed by Hilbert was to
find a mathematical procedure-or algorithm-for deciding which Diophan-
                          Consciousness and computation                        29

tine systems have solutions, like our first example above, and which have not,
as was the case for our second example. Recall (cf. §1 .5) that an algorithm is
just a computational procedure-the action of some Turing machine. Thus
Hilbert's tenth problem asks for a computational procedure for deciding when
a system of Diophantine equations can be solved.
    Hilbert's tenth problem was historically very important because, in posing
it, Hilbert raised an issue that had not been raised before. What does it actually
mean, in precise mathematical terms, to have an algorithmic solution to a class
of problems? What, in precise terms, is an algorithm? It was this very question
that led Alan Turing, in 1936, to propose his own particular definition of what
an algorithm is, in terms of his Turing machines. Other mathematicians
(Church, Kleene, Godel, Post, and others; cf. Gandy (1988)) proposed
somewhat different procedures at about the same time. All were soon shown to
be equivalent (by Turing and Church), but Turing's particular approach has
turned out to have been the most influential. (He, alone, introduced the idea of
having one particular all-inclusive algorithmic machine--called a universal
Turing machine-which can, by itself, achieve any algorithmic action
whatever. lt was this that led to the idea of a general-purpose computer, that is
so familiar to us now.) Turing was able to show that there are certain classes of
problem that do not have any algorithmic solution (in particular the 'halting
problem' that I shall describe shortly). However, Hilbert's actual tenth
problem had to wait until 1970 before the Russian mathematician Yuri
Matiyasevich-providing proofs that completed certain arguments that had
been earlier put forward by the Americans Julia Robinson, Martin Davis, and
Hilary Putnam-showed that there can be no computer program (algorithm)
which decides yes/no systematically to the question of whether a system of
Diophantine equations has a solution. (See Davis (1978) and Devlin (1988),
Chapter 6, for readable accounts of this story.) It may be remarked that
whenever the answer happens to be 'yes', then that fact can, in principle, be
ascertained by the particular computer program that just slavishly tries all sets
of integers one after the other. It is the answer 'no', on the other hand, that
eludes any systematic treatment. Various sets of rules for correctly giving the
answer 'no' can be provided-like the argument using even and odd numbers
that rules out solutions to the second system given above-but Matiyasevich's
theorem showed that these can never be exhaustive.
    Another example of a class of well-defined mathematical problems that
have no algorithmic solution is the tiling problem. This is formulated as
follows: given a set of polygonal shapes, decide whether these shapes will tile
the plane; that is, is it possible to cover the entire Euclidean plane using only
these particular shapes, without gaps or overlaps? This was (effectively) shown
to be a computationally insoluble problem by the American mathematician
Robert Berger in 1966, basing his arguments on an extension of some earlier
work by the Chinese-American mathematician Hao Wang in 1961 (see
Griinbaum and Shephard 1987). In fact, as I have just stated the problem,
30                           Consciousness and computation

there is some awkwardness about it, because general polygonal tiles would
need to be specified in some way using real numbers (numbers defined in terms
of infinite decimals), whereas ordinary algorithms operate on whole numbers.
This awkwardness can be removed by considering tiles that are made up just of
a number of squares joined together at their edges. Such tiles are called
polyominoes (see Golomb 1965; Gardner 1965, Chapter 1 3 ; Klamer 198 1 ).
Some examples are given in Fig. 1 .2. (For other examples of tile sets, see ENM,
pp. 133-7, Figs 4.6--4.12.) As a curious fact, the computational insolubility of
the tiling problem depends upon the existence of certain sets of polyominoes
called aperiodic sets-which will tile the plane only non-periodically (i.e. in a
way so that the completed pattern never repeats itself no matter how far it is
extended). In Fig. 1 .3, an aperiodic set of three polyominoes is exhibited
(developed from a tile set discovered by Robert Ammann in 1977, cf.
Griinbaum and Shephard (1987), Figs 10.4.1 1-10.4.1 3 on pp. 555-6).
   The mathematical proofs that Hilbert's tenth problem and the tiling
problem are not soluble by computational means are difficult, and I shall
certainly not attempt to give the arguments here. 1 3 The central point of each
argument is to show, in effect, how any Turing-machine action can be coded
into a Diophantine or tiling problem. This reduces the issue to one that Turing
actually addressed in his original discussion: the computational insolubility of
the halting problem-the problem of deciding those situations in which a
Turing-machine action fails ever to come to a halt. In §2.3, various explicit
computations that do not ever halt will be given; and in §2.5 a relatively simple
argument will be presented-based essentially on Turing's original one-that
shows, amongst other things, that the halting problem is indeed computation­
ally insoluble. (The implications of the 'other things' that this argument
actually shows will be central to the entire discussion of Part I ! )
   How can one use such a class of problems, such a s Diophantine equations or
the tiling problem, to construct a toy universe that is deterministic but non­
computable? Let us suppose that our model universe has a discrete time,
parameterized by the natural numbers (non-negative integers) 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, . . ..
At time n, the state of the universe is to be specified by one of the class of
problems under consideration-say, by a set of polyominoes. There are to be
two well-defined rules about which of the polyomino sets represents the state
of the universe at time n + 1 , given the polyomino set representing the universe
at time n, where the first of these rules is to be adapted if the polyominoes will
tile the plane and the second set is to be adopted when they will not tile the
plane. The details of how one might specify such rules are not particularly
important. One possibility would be to form a list S 0 , S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , S 4 , S 5 ,    of   •   •   •



all possible polyomino sets, in such a way that those involving an even total
number of squares have even suffixes: S 0 , S 2 , S 4 , S 6 , ; and those involving
                                                               •   •   •



an odd total number of squares have odd suffixes: S 1 , S 3 , S 5 , S 7 ,      •   .   (This
                                                                                       •   •



would not be too hard to arrange according to some computational pro­
cedure.) The 'dynamical evolution' of our toy model universe is now given by:

      Universe state Sn at time t proceeds to Sn + 1 at time t + 1 if the polyomino
      set sn will tile the plane and to sn + 2 if the set sn will not tile the plane.
Such a universe behaves entirely deterministically, but because there is no
general computational procedure for ascertaining when a polyomino set sn
will not tile the plane (which holds just as well if the total number of squares is
fixed as being even or as being odd) there is no computational simulation
possible of its actual development. (See Fig. 1 .4.)
   Of course, this kind of scheme is not to be taken seriously as modelling the
actual universe that we inhabit. It is presented here (as in ENM, p. 1 70) to
illustrate the little-appreciated fact that there is a clear difference between
determinism and computability. There are completely deterministic universe
models, with clear-cut rules of evolution, that are impossible to simulate
computationally. In fact, as we shall be seeing in §7.9, models of the very
specific kind that I have just been considering will turn out to be insufficient for
what is actually needed for viewpoint �- But we shall be seeing in §7.10 that
there are indeed some intriguing physical possibilities for what is needed!


                       1 . 1 0 What of the future?
What do the viewpoints .91, PA, �. !!) tell us to expect for the future of this
planet? According to .91, there will come a stage when appropriately
programmed supercomputers will reach-and then race beyond-all human
mental capabilities. Of course different people who hold to .91 could have very
different views as to the time scales involved in this. Some might reasonably
take the line that it will be many centuries before computers will reach our
level, so little being presently understood about the computations that the
brain must indeed be performing (they would claim) in order to achieve the
34                         Consciousness and computation

subtlety of action that we undoubtedly attain-a subtlety that would be
necessary before appreciable 'awareness' would take place. Others argue for a
much shorter timescale. In particular, Hans Moravec, in his book Mind
Children (1988), makes a reasoned case--based on the rate at which computer
technology has moved forward at an accelerating rate over the past half­
century and on the proportion of the brain's activity that he considers has
already been successfully simulated-to support his claim that 'human
equivalence' will already have been superseded by about the year 2030. (Some
have argued for a much shorter timescale 1 4-sometimes, even, where the
predicted date for human equivalence has already passed ! Lest the reader feel
dismayed by the prospect of being overtaken by computers in less than (say) 40
years' time, hope is offered-indeed promised-by the assured prospect of our
being able to transfer our 'mind programs' into the shining metallic (or plastic)
bodies of the robots of our choice, thereby obtaining for ourselves a form of
immortality (Moravec 1988, 1994).
   Such optimism is not available to the holders of viewpoint f!B , however.
Their standpoint does not differ from .91 with regard to what computers will
ultimately be able to achieve in an external way. An adequate simulation of the
action of a human brain could itself be used to control a robot, simulation
being all that is needed (Fig. 1 .5). The issue of the presence of conscious




      Fig. 1 .5 . According to viewpoint fJi, a computer simulation of the activity
      of a conscious human brain would in principle be possible, so ultimately
      computer-controlled robots could reach, and thereafter enormously
                             exceed all human capabilities.


awareness arising in association with this simulation is, according to f!B ,
irrelevant to how the robot behaves. It might take centuries, or it might take
less than 40 years for such a simulation to become a technical possibility. But
according to f!B , it should be possible eventually. Then such computers would
have reached the level of 'human equivalence'; and they would again be
                           Consciousness and computation                        35

  expected to race beyond whatever level we are able to achieve with our
  relatively puny brains. The option to 'j oin' the computer-controlled robots is
  now not open to us, and it would seem that we must resign ourselves to the
  prospect of a planet ultimately ruled by insentient machines! Of all the
  viewpoints d, �. �. �. it seems to me that it is � that offers the most
  pessimistic view of the future of our planet-despite its apparently 'common­
  sense' nature!
     According to � or �, on the other hand, it would be expected that the
  computers would (or should) always remain subservient to us, no matter how
  far they advance with respect to speed, capacity, and logical design. Viewpoint
  �. however, is open with regard to future scientific developments that might
  lead to the construction of devices-not based on computers as we understand
. them today, but upon the very non-computable physical action that �
  demands must underlie our own conscious thought processes-devices that
  could achieve actual intelligence and awareness. Perhaps it will be these
  devices, rather than 'computers', as we now understand that term, that will
  eventually race beyond all human capabilities. Possibly so, but such
  speculation seems to me to be extremely premature at the present time, since
  we lack almost all the scientific understanding that would be necessary, let
  alone any of the technological know-how. I shall return to this issue again in
  Part II (cf. §8. 1 ).


    1 . 1 1 Can computers have rights or responsibilities ?
 A related issue-one which might have a somewhat more immediate practical
 relevance-has begun to attract the attention of theoreticians in the legal
 profession Y This issue is whether, in the not-so-distant future, one might
 have to consider that computers could be held to have legal responsibilities or
 rights. Certainly, if in due course computers are to approach, or perhaps even
 exceed, human levels of expertise in many walks of life, then questions of this
 kind would indeed become relevant. If one believes in viewpoint d, then one
 would be clearly driven in the direction of having eventually to accept that
 computers (or computer-controlled robots) must potentially have both rights
 and responsibilities. For according to that viewpoint, there is no essential
 difference-apart from the 'accidents' of differing material construction­
 between ourselves and sufficiently advanced robots. For those who hold to
 viewpoint �. however, the issue seems less clear. One might reasonably argue
 that it is the possession of certain genuine mental qualities-such as suffering,
 anger, revenge, malice, faith, trust, intent, belief, understanding, or passion­
 that is the relevant issue with regard to rights or responsibilities. According to
 �. a computer-controlled robot wo:�ld have none of these qualities, and I
 suppose it could therefore have ndther rights nor responsibilities. Yet,
 according to �. there is no effective way of telling that these qualities are
36                        Consciousness and computation

absent, so one might be placed in something of a quandary if robots were to
achieve a sufficiently close mimicking of human behaviour.
   This quandary would appear to be eliminated with viewpoint CC (and,
presumably, also with viewpoint !?C) because, according to those viewpoints,
computers could not convincingly exhibit mental qualities-and would
certainly never actually possess them. It would accordingly follow that
computers can have no rights and no responsibilities either. To me, this is a
very reasonable point of view to adopt. In this book, I shall indeed be arguing
strongly against both d and f!i. Acceptance ofthe arguments that I give would
certainly simplify the legal position: computers or computer-controlled
robots, themselves, never have rights or responsibilties. Moreover, they
deserve no share of the blame when things go wrong-that would always lie
elsewhere!
   It should be made clear, however, that these arguments do not necessarily
apply to any putative 'devices', as noted above, that might ultimately be able
to take advantage of non-computational physics. But since the prospect of
such devices-if indeed they could be constructed at all-is not even on the
horizon, there is no legal issue to be faced on this score, in the foreseeable
future.
   The issue of 'responsibility' raises deep philosophical questions concerning
the ultimate causes of our behaviour. It might well be argued that each of our
actions is ultimately determined by our inheritance and by our environment­
or else by those numerous chance factors that continually affect our lives. Are
not all of these influences 'beyond our control', and therefore things for which
we cannot ultimately be held responsible? Is the matter of 'responsibility'
merely one of convenience of terminology, or is there actually something
else-a 'self lying beyond all such influences-which exerts a control over our
actions? The legal issue of 'responsibility' seems to imply that there is indeed,
within each one of us, some kind of an independent 'self with its own
responsibilities-and, by implication, rights-whose actions are not attribut­
able to inheritance, environment, or chance. If it is other than a mere
convenience of language that we speak as though there were such an
independent 'self, then there must be an ingredient missing from our present­
day physical understandings. The discovery of such an ingredient would
surely profoundly alter our scientific outlook.
   This book will not supply an answer to these deep issues, but I believe that it
may open the door to them by a crack-albeit only by a crack. It will not tell us
that there need necessarily be a 'self whose actions are not attributable to
external cause, but it will tell us to broaden our view as to the very nature of
what a 'cause' might be. A 'cause' could be something that cannot be computed
in practice or in principle. I shall argue that when a 'cause' is the effect of our
 conscious actions, then it must be something very subtle, certainly beyond
computation, beyond chaos, and also beyond any purely random influences.
Whether such a concept of'cause' could lead us any closer to an understanding
                          Consciousness and computation                           37

of the profound issue (or the 'illusion'?) of our free wills is a matter for the
future.


     1 . 1 2 'Awareness', 'understanding', 'consciousness',
                                  'intelligence'
In the above discussions I have, as yet, made no attempt to be precise about
any of the elusive concepts related to the issue of 'mind'. I have referred,
somewhat vaguely, to 'awareness' in the definitions of d, fJI, C(;, and !» given in
 §1 .3, but other qualities of mentality were not referred to at that point. I should
at least make some attempt to clarify the terminology that I am using here,
particularly in relation to such terms as 'understanding', 'consciousness', and
'intelligence', which have importance to the discussions of this book.
    While I do not believe that attempts at full definitions would necessarily be
helpful, some comments concerning my own terminology are in order. I am
often disconcerted to find that a use of these words that seems obvious to me
will disagree with what some others may claim as natural. For example, my
own use of the term 'understanding' certainly implies that a genuine possession
of this quality would require some element of awareness to be present. Without
any awareness of what some argument is all about, there can surely be no
genuine understanding of that argument. At least, this seems to me to be an
unexceptionable use of words, though in some contexts, proponents of AI
might appear to use the terms 'understanding' and 'awareness' in a way that
denies such an implication. Some proponents of AI (either d or Bl) would
claim that a computer-controlled robot 'understands' what its instructions are
even though no claim would be made that it is actually 'aware' of them. To me,
this is a misuse of the word 'understands', though it is a misuse that has a
genuine heuristic value for descriptions of computer functioning. When I am
trying to be clear that I am not using 'understands' in this heuristic way, I shall
use the phrase 'genuinely understands', or 'genuine understanding', for that
activity for which awareness is indeed necessary.
    Of course, some might argue that there is no clear-cut distinction between
these two uses of the term 'understands'. If one believes that there is no
distinction, then one must believe that awareness itself is an ill-defined
concept. This, I do not deny; but it seems clear to me that awareness is indeed
something, and this something may be present or absent, at least to a degree. If
one agrees that awareness is a something, then it seems natural that one should
also agree that this something must be part of any genuine understanding.
This still allows that the 'something' that is awareness might actually be a
feature of a purely computational activity, in accordance with viewpoint d.
   It would also seem to me to be unexceptionable to use the word 'intelligence'
only when there can be some understanding involved. However, again, certain
AI proponents might claim that their robot could be 'intelligent' without its
38                        Consciousness and computation

needing actually to 'understand' anything. The term 'artificial intelligence'
implies that intelligent computational activity is presumed possible, but
genuine understanding-and certainly awareness-is argued by some to be
outside the aims of AI. To my own way of thinking, 'intelligence' without
understanding is a misnomer. To a limited degree, some kind of partial
simulation of genuine intelligence without any actual understanding may
sometimes be possible. (Indeed, one not infrequently encounters human
individuals who are able to fool us for a while into believing that they possess
some understanding, when it finally emerges that indeed they possess none
whatever! ) It will be an important feature of my later discussions that there is
indeed a clear-cut distinction between genuine intelligence (or genuine
understanding) and any entirely computationally simulated activity. Accord­
ing to my own terminology, the possession of genuine intelligence indeed
requires that genuine understanding must be present. Hence, my use of the
term 'intelligence' (especially when prefixed with the word 'genuine') would
imply the presence of some actual awareness.
   To me, this seems to be a natural terminology, but many AI proponents 1 6
(certainly those who do not support viewpoint d) would strongly deny that
they are attempting to provide an artificial 'awareness' even though, as the
name seems to imply, they are indeed attempting to construct an artificial
'intelligence'. Perhaps such people would assert that they are (in accordance
with viewpoint Pi) merely simulating intelligence-which does not need actual
understanding or awareness-rather than attempting to achieve what I am
calling genuine intelligence. Perhaps they would claim not to recognize any
distinction between genuine and simulated intelligence, as would be an
implication of viewpoint d. It will be ohe of my purposes, in later arguments,
to show that there is indeed an aspect of 'genuine understanding' that cannot
be properly simulated in any computational way whatever. Consequently,
there must indeed be a distinction between genuine intelligence and any
attempt at a proper computational simulation of it.
   Of course I have not defined any of the terms 'intelligence', 'understanding',
or 'awareness'. I think that it would be most unwise to attempt to give full
definitions here. We shall need to rely, to some extent, on our intuitive
perceptions as to what these words actually mean. If our intuitive concept of
'understanding' is that it is something that is necessary for 'intelligence', then
 an argument which establishes the non-computational nature of 'understand­
ing' will also establish the non-computational . nature of 'intelligence'.
 Moreover, if 'awareness' is something that is needed for 'understanding', then
 a non-computational physical basis for the phenomenon of awareness might
 account for such a non-computational nature for 'understanding'. Thus, my
 own use of these terms (and, I maintain, common usage also) entails the
 implications:

(a) 'intelligence' requires 'understanding'
                          Consciousness and computation                          39

and
(b) 'understanding' requires 'awareness'.
   Awareness, I take to be one aspect-the passive aspect-ofthe phenomenon
of consciousness. Consciousness has an active aspect also, namely the feeling of
free will. I shall not attempt a full definition of the word 'consciousness' here
either (and certainly not of 'free will'), even though my arguments are directed
towards the goal of ultimately comprehending this phenomenon of conscious­
ness in scientific but non-computational terms-as would be required by
viewpoint �. Nor do I claim to have proceeded any great distance along the
road towards this goal, though I hope that the arguments that I am presenting
in this book (and in ENM) will provide a few useful signposts-and perhaps
even a little more than that. I feel that to attempt to define the term
 'consciousness' too closely at this stage would put us in danger of allowing to
slip away the very concept that we wish to ensnare. Accordingly, instead of
 providing some premature and inadequate definition, I shall give just a few
descriptive comments concerning my use of the term 'consciousness'. When all
is said and done, we must ultimately rely upon our intuitive comprehension of
its meaning.
    This is not intended to suggest that I believe that we really 'intuitively know'
what consciousness actually 'is', but merely that there is such a concept that we
are trying to grasp in some way-a genuine scientifically describable
 phenomenon, playing an active as well as a passive role in the activities of the
physical world. Some people appear to believe that the concept is too vague to
 merit serious study. Yet such people 1 7 frequently do not hesitate to discuss the
 concept of 'mind' as though it were better defined. The normal usage of the
word 'mind' allows that there can be (and indeed is) something that we often
refer to as the 'unconscious mind'. To my way of thinking, there is a much
greater obscurity concerning the concept of an unconscious mind even than
 that of a conscious one. Although I make not infrequent use of the word 'mind'
 myself also, I am making no attempt to be precise about it. The concept of
'mind'-apart from whatever is already embodied in the term 'conscious­
 ness'-will not play the central role in my attempts at rigorous discussion.
    So what do I mean by consciousne�s? As I have remarked earlier, there are
both passive and active aspects to consciousness, but it is not always clear that
 there is a distinction between the two. The perceplion of the colour red, on the
 one hand, is something that certainly requires passive consciousness, as is the
 sensation of pain or the appreciation of a melody. Active consciousness is
involved in the willed action to get up from one's bed, as it is in a deliberate
decision to desist from some energetic activity. The bringing to mind of an
early memory involves both active and passive aspects of consciousness.
Consciousness, active and passive, would also be normally involved in the
formulation of a future plan of action, and it certainly seems to be that there is
a necessity for some kind of consciousness in the type of mental activity that
40                        Consciousness and computation

would normally be encompassed in the word 'understanding'. Moreover, we
may be (passively) conscious, to a degree, even when we are asleep, provided
that we experience some dream (and even the active aspect of consciousness
may sometimes begin to be playing a role just as we awake).
   Some people might dispute an all-embracing role of a single concept of
consciousness in all of these various manifestations. They might insist that
there are numerous quite different concepts of 'consciousness' involved-not
merely just 'active' and 'passive'-and that there are really a great many
distinct mental attributes separately pertinent to all these various mental
qualities. Accordingly, applying the blanket term 'consciousness' to all of these
might be considered to be, at best, unhelpful. In my own view, there is indeed a
unified concept of'consciousness' that is central to all these separate aspects of
mentality. While I do admit to there being passive and active aspects to
consciousness that are sometimes distinguishable, the passive having to do
with sensations (or 'qualia') and the active with the issues of 'free will', I take
these to be two sides of a single coin.
   I shall be primarily concerned, in Part I of this book, with the issue of what it
is possible to achieve by use of the mental quality of'understanding'. Though I
do not attempt to define what this word means, I hope that its meaning will
indeed be clear enough that the reader will be persuaded that this quality­
whatever it is-must indeed be an essential part of that mental activity needed
for an acceptance of the arguments of §2.5. I propose to show that the
appreciation of these arguments must involve something non-computational.
My argument does not so directly address the other issues of 'intelligence',
'awareness', 'consciousness', or 'mind', but there should be a clear relevance of
that discussion to those concepts also, since the 'common-sense' terminology
that I have indicated above implies that awareness ought indeed to be an
essential ingredient of our understanding, and that understanding must be a
part of any genuine intelligence.

                    1 . 1 3 John Searle's argument
Before presenting my own reasoning, I should make brief reference to a quite
different line of argument-the well-known 'Chinese Room', of the philo­
sopher John Searle 1 8-mainly in order to emphasize the very different
character and underlying intentions of my own line of reasoning. Searle's
argument is also concerned with the issue of 'understanding' and whether an
appropriately sophisticated computer action can be said to achieve that
mental quality. I shall not repeat the Searle discussion in detail here, but give
its essence only very briefly.
   It is concerned with some computer program that purports to simulate
'understanding' by providing replies to questions put to it about a story that it
has been told-all questions and answers being in Chinese. Searle then
envisages a human subject, ignorant of Chinese, laboriously moving counters
                           Consciousness and computation                          41

around in such a way as to act out all the detailed computations that the
computer would perform. However, despite the appearance of understanding
that is involved in the computer's output when it performs the computations,
no such understanding is actually experienced by the human performing
manipulations that enact these computations. Searle argues, accordingly, that
the mental quality of understanding cannot be just a computational matter­
for the human subject (not understanding Chinese) carries out every single act
of computation that the computer carries out, but experiences no understand­
ing whatever of the stories. Searle allows that a simulation of the output of the
results of understanding could be possible, in accordance with viewpoint PA,
since he is prepared to admit that this could be achieved by a computer
simulating every relevant physical action of a human brain (doing whatever it
does) when its human owner actually understands something. But by the
Chinese Room argument, he insists that a simulation cannot, in itself, actually
'feel' any understanding. Thus actual understanding could not in fact be
achieved by any computer simulation.
   Searle's argument is directed against .91 (which would assert that any
'simulation' of understanding would be equivalent to 'actual' understanding)
and it is presented as providing support for f!l (although equally supporting CIJ
or !ZI). It is concerned with the passive, inward, or subjective aspects of the
quality of understanding. It does not deny the possibility of a simulation of
understanding in its active, outward, or objective aspects. Indeed, Searle
himself is on record as asserting: 'Of course the brain is a digital computer.
Since everything is a digital computer, brains are too.' 1 9 This suggests that he
would be prepared to accept the possibility of a complete simulation of the
action of a conscious brain in the act of'understanding' something, whence the
external manifestations of this simulation would be identical with those of an
actual conscious human being-in accordance with viewpoint PA. My own
arguments, on the other hand, will be directed against just these outward
aspects of 'understanding' and I thereby maintain that not even a proper
computer simulation of the external manifestations of understanding is
possible. I do not address Searle's discussion in detail here, since it offers no
direct support for viewpoint CIJ (support for CIJ being the purpose of my own
arguments here). For the record, however, it is worth remarking that I do
regard the Chinese Room argument as providing a somewhat persuasive case
against d, although I do not think that this case is at all a conclusive one. For
further details and various counter-arguments, see Searle (1980) and the
discussion therein and in Hofstadter and Dennett (198 1 ); see also Dennett
(1990) and Searle (1992). For my own assessment see ENM, pp. 1 7-23.

 1 . 14 Some difficulties with the computational model
Before turning to the issues that specifically separate CIJ from .91 and from PA, let
us consider certain other difficulties that must be faced by any attempt at
42                        Consciousness and computation

explanation of the phenomenon of consciousness in accordance with
viewpoint d. According to d, it is the mere 'carrying out' or enaction of
appropriate algorithms that is supposed to evoke awareness. But what does
this actually mean? Does 'enaction' mean that bits of physical material must
be moved around in accordance with the successive operations of the
algorithm? Suppose we imagine these successive operations to be written out
line by line in a massive book. 20 Wauld the act of writing or printing these lines
constitute 'enaction'? Would the mere static existence of the book be
sufficient? What about simply moving one's finger down the lines one after the
other; would that count as 'enaction'? What about moving a finger over the
symbols if they are written in braille? How about projecting the pages of the
book successively on a screen? Does the mere presentation of the successive
operations of an algorithm constitute enaction? Wauld it be necessary, on the
other hand, to have someone check that each line correctly follows from those
that precede it, according to the rules of the algorithm in question?
Presumably that, at least, would be begging the question, since no auxiliary
person's (conscious) understandings should be needed for the process. The
issue of what physical actions should count as actually enacting an algorithm
is profoundly unclear. Perhaps such actions are not necessary at all, and to be
in accordance with viewpoint d, the mere Platonic mathematical existence of
the algorithm (cf. §1 . 1 7) would be sufficient for its 'awareness' to be present.
   In any case, it would presumably not be the case, according to d, that just
any complicated algorithm could evoke (appreciable) awareness. It would be
expected that some special features of the algorithm such as 'higher-level
organization', or 'universality', or 'self-reference', or 'algorithmic simplicity/
complexity', 2 1 or some such, would be needed before significant awareness
could be considered to be evoked. Moreover, there is the sticky issue of what
particular qualities of an algorithm would be supposed to be responsible for
the various different 'qualia' that constitute our awareness. What kind of
computation evokes the sensation 'red', for example? What computations
constitute the sensations of 'pain', 'sweetness', 'harmoniousness', 'pungency',
or whatever? Attempts have sometimes been made by proponents of d to
address issues of this nature (cf. Dennett 199 1 , for example), but so far these
attempts do not strike me as at all persuasive.
   Moreover, any clear-cut and reasonably simple algorithmic suggestion
(such as any that can have been made in the literature so far) would suffer from
the drawback that it could be implemented without great difficulty on a
present-day electronic computer. Such an implementation would, according
to the proponents of such a suggestion, have to evoke the actual experience of
the intended qualium. It would be hard, even for those who adhere strongly to
viewpoint d, to accept seriously that such a computation-any computation
that could be set in action on the computers of today, using the AI
understandings of today-could actually experience mentality to any
significant degree. It would therefore appear to be the case that proponents of
                            Consciousness and computation                          43

such suggestions must resort to the belief that it is the sheer complication ofthe
computations (acting in accordance with these suggestions) that are involved
in the activities of our own brains that allow us to have appreciable mental
experiences.
   This raises some other issues that I have not seen addressed, to any
significant degree. If one believes that it is essentially the vast complication of
the 'wirings' constituting the interconnected network of the brain's neurons
and synapses that is the prerequisite for our significant conscious mental
activity, then one must somehow come to terms with the fact that
consciousness is not equally a feature of all parts of the human brain. When the
term 'brain' is used without qualification, it is natural (at least for non­
specialists) to think in terms of the large convoluted outer regions that
constitute what is known as the cerebral cortex-the outer grey matter of the
cerebrum. There are roughly one hundred thousand million (10 1 1 ) neurons
involved in the cerebral cortex, which indeed leaves considerable scope for
enormous complication-but the cerebral cortex is far from being all there is
to the brain. At the back and underneath is another important entangled mass
of neurons known as the cerebellum (see Fig. 1 .6). The cerebellum appears to




              Human brain                                    neurons
      Fig. 1 .6. The number of neurons and neuron connections in the
      cerebellum is of the same order as in the cerebrum. On the basis simply of
      neuron counting and neuron interconnectivity, we ask, why is the action
                        of the cerebellum entirely unconscious?


be critically involved in the perfection of motor control, and it comes into play
when some motor skill has been mastered-to become 'second nature', and
not thought about consciously. Initially, when a new skill is learned, conscious
control of one's actions is needed, and it appears that this is achieved with the
essential involvement of the cerebral cortex. Yet, later, when the necessary
movements have become 'automatic', the unconscious activity of the
cerebellum largely takes over. It is remarkable, in view of the fact that the
44                         Consciousness and computation

activity of the cerebellum appears to be entirely unconscious, that it involves
perhaps up to one half as many neurons as the cerebrum. Moreover, the
Purkinje cells, referred to in §1 .2, that have up to 80 000 synaptic connections,
are neurons that are found in the cerebellum, so the total number of
connections between neurons may well be no fewer in the cerebellum than in
the cerebrum. If it is to be the sheer complication of the network of neurons
that is regarded as the essential prerequisite for consciousness, then one must
ask why consciousness seems to be entirely absent in the actions of the
cerebellum. (I shall have some comments to make on this issue later, in §8.6).
  Of course, the problems for viewpoint d referred to in this section have
their analogues also for 14 and C(J . On any scientific viewpoint, one would need
eventually to address the issue of what it is that underlies the phenomenon of
consciousness, and of how qualia can come about. In the later sections of
Part II, I shall be attempting to move tentatively towards an understanding of
consciousness from the point of view of C(J .


  1 . 1 5 Do limitations of present-day AI provide a case
                                          for CC?
But why ((5'? What evidence is there which can be interpreted as providing
direct support for ((5'? Is C(J really a serious alternative to d or �, or even to !!)?
We must try to see what it is that we can actually do with our brains (or minds)
when conscious deliberations come into play-and I shall be trying to
convince the reader that (sometimes at least) what we do with our conscious
thinking is very different from anything that can be achieved computationally.
Adherents of d would be likely to maintain that 'computing', in one form or
another, is the only possibility-and, as far as the effects on external behaviour
are concerned, so also would the adherents of�. On the other hand, adherents
of !!) might well agree with ((5' that conscious actions must be things beyond
computation, but they would deny the possibility of an explanation of
consciousness in any kind of scientific terms. Thus, in order to give support to
C(J , one must try to find examples of mental activity that lie beyond any form of
computation, and also try to see how such activity might result from
appropriate physical processes. The remainder of Part I will be directed
towards the former goal, whilst in Part II, I shall present my attempts to come
to terms with the latter.
     What kind of mental activity might there be which could be shown to lie
beyond computation? As a possible route to this, we could try to examine the
present state of artificial intelligence, and try to see what computationally
controlled systems are good at and what they are bad at. Of course, the present
state of the art of AI may not give a clear indication of what might ultimately
be achieved in principle. Even in 50 years, say, things could well be very
different from what they are at present. The rapid development of computers
                          Consciousness and computation                          45

and their applications-only within the past 50 years-has been extra­
ordinary. We must certainly be prepared for enormous advances in the
future-advances that might possibly come upon us very swiftly indeed. I shall
be primarily concerned, in this book, not with the speed of such advances, but
with certain fundamental limitations ofprinciple that they are subject to. These
limitations would apply no matter how many centuries into the future we may
be prepared to project our speculations. Thus, we should base our arguments
on general principles and not allow ourselves to be unduly influenced by what
has been achieved to date. Nevertheless, there could well be clues contained in
the successes and failures of the artificial intelligence of today, despite the fact
that, so far, there is very little of what could be called a genuinely convincing
artificial intelligence-as even the strongest proponents of AI would be
prepared to admit.
   The main failures of artificial intelligence to date, perhaps rather
surprisingly, are not so much in areas where the power of human intellect can
itself be extremely impressive-such as where particular human experts can
dumbfound the rest of us with their specialist knowledge or their ability to
make judgements based on deeply complicated computational procedures­
but in the 'common-sense' activities that the humblest among us indulge in for
most of our waking lives. As yet, no computer-controlled robot could begin to
compete with even a young child in performing some of the simplest of
everyday activities: such as recognizing that a coloured crayon lying on the
floor at the other end of the room is what is needed to complete a drawing,
walking across to collect that crayon, and then putting it to its use. For that
matter, even the capabilities of an ant, in performing its everyday activities,
would far surpass what can be achieved by the most sophisticated of today's
computer control systems. Yet, on the other hand, the development of
powerful chess computers provides a striking example in which computers can
be enormously effective. Chess is undoubtedly an activity where the power of
the human intellect is particularly manifest-though exploited to excellence in
this way by but a few. Yet chess computer systems now play the game
extraordinarily well, and can consistently beat most human players. Even the
very best of human experts are now being hard pressed, and may not for long
retain what superiority they still possess over the best of chess-playing
computers. 22 There are also several other areas of expertise, in which
computers can compete successfully, or partially successfully, with human
experts. Moreover, there are some, such as straightforward numerical
computation, in which the capabilities of computers far outstrip the
capabilities of humans.
   In all these situations, however, it would be hard to maintain that the
computer attains any genuine understanding of what it is actually doing. In the
case of a top-down organization, the reason that the system successfully works
at all is not that it understands anything, but that human programmers'
understandings (or else the understandings of those human experts upon
46                          Consciousness and computation

whom the programmers depend) have been used in the construction of the
program. For a bottom-up organization, it is not clear that there need be any
specific understanding whatever, as a feature of the system's actions, on the
part either of the device itself or of its programmers-beyond those human
understandings that would have gone into the designing of the details of the
specific performance-improving algorithms that are involved, and in the very
conception that a system can improve its performance with experience
whenever an appropriate feedback system is incorporated. Of course, it is not
always clear what the term 'understanding' actually means, so some people
might claim that on their terms, these computer systems actually do possess
some kind of 'understanding'.
  But is this reasonable? To illustrate a lack of any real understanding by
present-day computers, it is interesting to provide, as an example, the chess
position given in Fig. 1 .7 (taken from an article by Jane Seymore and David




     Fig. 1 .7 . White to play and draw-easy for humans, but Deep Thought
                                   took the rook !



Norwood (1993)). In this position, black has an enormous material
advantage, to the extent of two rooks and a bishop. However, it is easy for
white to avoid defeat, by simply moving his* king around on his side of the
board. The wall of pawns is impregnable to the black pieces, so there is no
danger to white from the black rooks or bishop. This much is obvious to any

       *White is, of course, not necessarily male. See Notes to the reader on p. xvi.
                          Consciousness and computation                         47

human player with a reasonable familiarity with the rules of chess. However,
when the position, with white to move, was presented to 'Deep Thought'-the
most powerful chess computer of its day, with a number of victories over
human chess grandmasters to its credit-it immediately blundered into taking
the black rook with its pawn, opening up the barrier of pawns to achieve a
hopelessly lost position!
   How could such a wonderfully effective chess player make such an
obviously stupid move? The answer is that all Deep Thought had been
programmed to do, in addition to having been provided with a considerable
amount of 'book knowledge', would be to calculate move after move after
move-to some considerable depth-and to try to improve its material
situation. At no stage can it have had any actual understanding of what a pawn
barrier might achieve-nor, indeed, could it ever have any genuine
understanding whatsoever of anything at all that it does.
   To anyone with sufficient appreciation of the general way in which Deep
Thought or other chess-playing computer systems are constructed, it is no real
surprise that it would fail on positions such as that of Fig. 1 .7. Not only can we
understand something about chess that Deep Thought did not, but we can
also understand something of the (top-down) procedures according to which
Deep Thought has been constructed; so we can actually appreciate why it
should make such a blunder-as well as understanding why it could play chess
so effectively in most other circumstances. However, we may ask: is it possible
that Deep Thought, or any other AI system, could eventually achieve any of
the kind of real understandings that we can have-of chess, or of anything
else? Some AI proponents might argue that in order for an AI system to gain
any 'actual' understanding, it would need to be programmed in a way that
involves bottom-up procedures in a much more basic way than is usual for
chess-playing computers. Accordingly, its 'understandings' would develop
gradually by its building up a wealth of 'experience', rather than having
specific top-down algorithmic rules built into it. Top-down rules that are
simple enough for us to appreciate easily could not, by themselves, provide a
computational basis for actual understanding-for we can use our very
understandings of these rules to realize their fundamental limitations.
   This point will be made more explicit in the arguments given in Chapters 2
and 3. But what about these bottom-up computational procedures? Is it
possible that they could form the basis of understanding? In Chapter 3, I shall
be arguing otherwise. For the moment, we may simply take note of the fact
that present-day computer systems do not in any way substitute for genuine
human understanding-in any significant area of intellectual expertise where
genuine and continuing human understanding and insight seem to be
important. This much, I feel sure, would be broadly accepted today. For the
most part, the very optimistic early claims2 3 that had sometimes been made by
proponents of artificial intelligence and promoters of expert systems have not
yet been fulfilled.
48                        Consciousness and computation

   But these are still very early days, if we are to consider what artificial
intelligence might ultimately achieve. Proponents of AI (either d or £161) would
maintain that it is just a matter of time, and perhaps some further significant
developments in their craft, before important elements of understanding will
indeed begin to become apparent in the behaviour of their computer­
controlled systems. Later, I shall try to argue in precise terms against this, and
that there are fundamental limitations to any purely computational system,
whether top-down or bottom-up. Although it might well be possible for a
sufficiently cleverly constructed such system to preserve an illusion, for some
considerable time (as with Deep Thought), that it possesses some understand­
ing, I shall maintain that a computer system's actual lack of general
understanding should-in principle, at least-eventually reveal itself.
   For my precise arguments I shall need to turn to some mathematics, the
intention being to show that 'mathematical understanding is something that
cannot be reduced to computation. Some AI proponents might find this
surprising, for they have argued2 4 that the things that came late in human
evolution, like the performing of arithmetical or algebraic calculation, are the
things that come most easily to computers, and where computers already
outstrip by far the abilities of calculating human beings; whereas those skills
that were evolved early, like walking or the interpretation of complicated
visual scenes, are things that we perform effortlessly, whilst present-day
computers struggle to achieve their unimpressively limited performances. I
shall argue very differently. Any complicated activity, which may be
mathematical calculations, or playing a game of chess, or commonplace
actions-if they have been understood in terms of clear-cut/computational
rules-are the things that modern computers are good at; but the very
understanding that underlies these computational rules is something that is
itself beyond computation.




          1 . 1 6 The argument from Godel's theorem
How can we be sure that such understandings are not themselves things that
can be reduced to computational rules? I shall shortly be giving (in Chapters 2
and 3) some very strong reasons for believing that effects of (certain kinds of)
understanding cannot be properly simulated in any kind of computational
terms-neither with a top-down, nor a bottom-up organization, nor with any
combination ofthe two. Thus, the human faculty of being able to 'understand'
is something that must be achieved by some non-computational activity of the
brain or mind. The reader may be reminded (cf. §1 .5, §1 .9) that the term 'non­
computational' here refers to something beyond any kind of effective
simulation by means of any computer based on the logical principles that
                          Consciousness and computation                          49

underlie all the electronic or mechanical calculating devices of today. On the
other hand, 'non-computational activity' does not imply something beyond
the powers of science and mathematics. But it does imply that viewpoints d
and (fl cannot explain how we actually perform all those tasks that are the
results of conscious mental activity.
   It is certainly a logical possibility that the conscious brain (or conscious
mind) might act according to such non-computational laws (cf. §1 .9). But is it
true? The argument I shall present in the next chapter (§2.5) provides what I
believe to be a very clear-cut argument for a non-computational ingredient in
our conscious thinking. This depends upon a simple form of the famous and
powerful theorem of mathematical logic, due to the great Czech-born logician
Kurt GOdel. I shall need only a very simplified form of this argument,
requiring only very little mathematics (where I also borrow from an important
later idea due to Alan Turing). Any reasonably dedicated reader should find
no great difficulty in following it. However, GOdel-type arguments, used in
this kind of way, have sometimes been vigorously disputed.2 5 Consequently,
some readers might have gained an impression that this argument from
Godel's theorem has been fully refuted. I should make it clear this is not so. It is
true that many counter-arguments have been put forward over the years.
Many of these were aimed at a pioneering earlier argument-in favour of
mentalism and opposed to physicalism-that had been advanced by the
Oxford philosopher John Lucas (1961). Lucas had argued from the GOdel
theorem that mental faculties must indeed lie beyond what can be achieved
computationally. (Others, such as Nagel and Newman (1958), had previously
argued in a similar vein.) My own argument, though following similar lines, is
presented somewhat differently from that of Lucas-and not necessarily as
support for mentalism. I believe that my form of presentation is better able to
withstand the different criticisms that have been raised against the Lucas
argument, and to show up their various inadequacies.
   In due course (in Chapters 2 and 3), I shall be addressing, in detail, all the
different counter-arguments that have come to my attention. I hope that my
discussion there will serve to correct not only some apparently widespread
misconceptions about the significance of the Godel argument, but also the
evidently inadequate brevity of my discussion in ENM. I shall demonstrate
that a good many of these counter-arguments are based merely on
misconceptions; the remaining ones, which put forward genuine viewpoints
that need to be considered in detail, perhaps provide just possible let-outs, in
accordance with d or (fl, but I shall argue that they nevertheless do not really
provide plausible explanations of what our ability to 'understand' actually
allows us to achieve, and that these let-outs would in any case be oflittle value
to AI. Anyone who maintains that all the external manifestations of conscious
thought processes can be properly computationally simulated, in accordance
with either viewpoint d or (fl, must find some way of coming to terms, in full
detail, with the arguments that I shall give.
50                        Consciousness and computation


                   1 . 1 7 Platonism or mysticism ?
Some critics may argue, however, that by seeming to force us into either
viewpoint rtf or viewpoint �. the GOdel argument has implications that must
be regarded as being 'mystical', and certainly no more palatable to them than
any such let-out from the Godel argument. With regard to �. I am in effect
agreeing with them. My own reasons for rejecting �-the viewpoint which
asserts the incompetence of the power of science when it comes to matters of
the mind-spring from an appreciation of the fact that it has only been
through use of the methods of science and mathematics that any real progress
in understanding the behaviour ofthe world has been achieved. Moreover, the
only minds of which we have direct knowledge are those intimately associated
with particular physical objects-brains-and differences in states of mind
seem to be clearly associated with differences in the physical states of brains.
Even the mental states of consciousness seems to be associated with certain
specific types of physical activity taking place within the brain. If it were not for
the puzzling aspects of consciousness that relate to the presence of 'awareness'
and perhaps of our feelings of 'free will', which as yet seem to elude physical
description, we should not need to feel tempted to look beyond the standard
methods of science for explanation of minds as a feature of the physical
behaviour of brains.
   On the other hand, it should be made clear that science and mathematics
have themselves revealed a world full of mystery. The deeper that our scientific
understanding becomes, the more profound the mystery that is revealed. It is
perhaps noteworthy that the physicists, who are the more directly familiar
with the puzzling and mysterious ways in which matter actually behaves, tend
to take a less classically mechanistic view of the world than do the biologists.
In Chapter 5, I shall be explaining some of the more mysterious aspects of
quantum behaviour, a few of which have been only fairly recently uncovered.
It may well be that in order to accommodate the mystery of mind, we shall
need a broadening of what we presently mean by 'science', but I see no reason
to make any clean break with those methods that have served us so
extraordinarily well. If, as I believe, the Godel argument is consequently
forcing us into an acceptance of some form of viewpoint rtf, then we shall also
have to come to terms with some of its other implications. We shall find
ourselves driven towards a Platonic viewpoint of things. According to Plato,
mathematical concepts and mathematical truths inhabit an actual world of
their own that is timeless and without physical location. Plato's world is an
ideal world of perfect forms, distinct from the physical world, but in terms of
which the physical world must be understood. lt also lies beyond our imperfect
mental constructions; yet, our minds do have some direct access to this
 Platonic realm through an 'awareness' of mathematical forms, and our ability
 to reason about them. We shall find that whilst our Platonic perceptions can
 be aided on occasion by computation, they are not limited by computation. It
                         Consciousness and computation                        51

is this potential for the 'awareness' of mathematical concepts involved i n this
Platonic access that gives the mind a power beyond what can ever be achieved
by a device dependent solely upon computation for its action.



        1 . 1 8 What is the relevance of mathematical
                         understanding?
Such airy-fairy stuff may (or may not) be all very well, some readers will
doubtless complain. What serious relevance do sophisticated issues of
mathematics and of mathematical philosophy have for most of the matters of
direct interest to artificial intelligence, for example? Indeed, many philoso­
phers and proponents of AI are quite reasonably of the opinion that although
Godel's theorem is undoubtedly important in its original context of
mathematical logic, it can have very limited implications, at best, for AI or for
the philosophy of mind. Very little of human mental activity is directed, after
all, at issues relating to Godel's original context: the axiomatic foundations of
mathematics. My answer is that a great deal of human mental activity
involves, on the other hand, the application of human consciousness and
understanding. My use of the Godel argument is to show that human
understanding cannot be an algorithmic activity. If we can show this in some
specific context, this will suffice. Once it is shown that certain types of
mathematical understanding must elude computational description, then it is
established that we can do something non-computational with our minds. This
being accepted, it is a natural step to conclude that non-computational action
must be present in many other aspects of mental activity. The floodgates will
indeed be open!
   The mathematical argument establishing the needed form of Godel's
theorem, as given in Chapter 2, may well seem to have very little direct bearing
on most aspects of consciousness. Indeed, a demonstration that certain kinds
of mathematical understanding must involve something beyond computation
does not appear to have much relevance to what is involved in our perception
of the colour red, for example, nor does there seem to be any manifest role for
mathematical desiderata in most other aspects of consciousness. For example,
even mathematicians do not normally think of mathematics when they are
dreaming! Dogs appear to dream, and are presumably also aware, to some
extent, when they dream; and I would certainly think that they can be aware at
other times. But they do not do mathematics. Undoubtedly, contemplating
mathematics is very far from being the only animal activity requiring
consciousness ! It is a highly specialized and peculiarly human activity.
(Indeed, some cynics might even say that it is an activity confined to certain
peculiar humans.) The phenomenon of consciousness, on the other hand, is
ubiquitous, being likely to be present in much non-human as well as human
52                       Consciousness and computation

mental activity, and certainly in non-mathematical humans, as well as in
mathematical humans when they are not actually doing mathematics (which is
most of the time). Mathematical thinking is a very tiny area of conscious
activity that is indulged in by a tiny minority of conscious beings for a limited
fraction of their conscious lives.
   Why then do I choose to address the question of consciousness here in a
mathematical context first? The reason is that it is only within mathematics
that we can expect to find anything approaching a rigorous demonstration
that some, at least, of conscious activity must be non-computational. The issue
of computation, by its very nature, is indeed a mathematical one. We cannot
expect to be able to provide anything like a 'proof that some activity is not
computational unless we tum to mathematics. I shall try to persuade the
reader that whatever we do with our brains or minds when we understand
mathematics is indeed different from anything that we can achieve by use of a
computer; then the reader should be more readily prepared to accept an
important role for non-computational activity in conscious thinking gener­
ally.
   N¥vertheless, as many might argue, it is surely just obvious that the
sensation of 'red' can in no way be evoked merely by the carrying out of some
computation. Why bother at all with attempting some unnecessary mathe­
matical demonstration when it is perfectly obvious that 'qualia'-i.e.
subjective experiences-have nothing to do with computation? One answer is
that this argument from 'obviousness' (with which I do have a considerable
sympathy) refers only to the passive aspects of consciousness. Like Searle's
Chinese Room, it may be presented as an argument against viewpoint d, but
it does not distinguish � from fJI.
   Moreover, I must attack the functionalist's computational model (i.e.
viewpoint d) on its home ground, so to speak; for it is the contention of the
functionalists that all qualia must indeed be somehow evoked by merely
carrying out the appropriate computations, no matter how improbable such a
picture may at first sight seem. For, they argue, what else can we indeed be
usefully doing with our brains unless it is performing computations of some
kind? What is the brain for, if not just some kind of-albeit highly
sophisticated-computational control system? Whatever 'feelings of aware­
ness' the brain's action somehow evokes must, they would claim, be the result
of this computational action. They often maintain that if one refuses to accept
the computational model for all mental activity, including consciousness, then
one must be resorting to mysticism. (This is to suggest that the only alternative
to viewpoint d is viewpoint �!) It is my intention, in Part II of this book, to
provide some partial suggestions as to what else a scientifically describable
brain might actually be doing. I shall not deny that some of the 'constructive'
parts of my argument are speculative. Yet I believe that the case for some kind
of non-computational action is compelling, and it is in order to demonstrate
the compelling nature of this case that I must tum to mathematical thinking.

 1 . 1 9 What has Godel's theorem to do with common­
                             sense behaviour?
But suppose that it is accepted that something non-computational is indeed
going on when we use our conscious mathematical judgements and reach our
conscious mathematical decisions. What help will this be to us in coming to
terms with the limitations of robot activity that, as I have mentioned above,
seem to lie much more with elementary 'common-sense' actions than with the
sophisticated behaviour of trained experts? At first sight it seems that my
conclusions will be almost the opposite of what is found for the limitations of
artificial intelligence-at least the present-day limitations. For it seems that I
am asserting that non-computational behaviour is to be found in highly
sophisticated areas of mathematical understanding, rather than in common­
sense behaviour. But that is not my claim. I am claiming that 'understanding'
involves the same kind of non-computational process, whether it lies in a
genuine mathematical perception, say of the infinitude of natural numbers, or       ·



merely in perceiving that an oblong-shaped object can be used to prop open a
window, or in understanding how an animal may be secured or released by a
few selected motions of a bit of rope, or in comprehending the meanings of the
words 'happiness', 'fighting', or 'tomorrow', or in realizing that when
Abraham Lincoln's left foot was in Washington his right foot was almost
certainly in Washington also-to use an example that proved surprisingly
troublesome to an actual AI system !2 6 This non-computational process lies in
whatever it is that allows us to become directly aware of something. This
awareness can allow us to visualize the geometrical motions of a block of
wood, or the topological properties of a piece of rope, or the connectedness of
Abraham Lincoln. It also allows us to have some kind of direct route to
another person's experiences, so that one can 'know' what the other person
must mean by a word like 'happiness', 'fighting', and 'tomorrow', even though
explanations are likely to have been quite inadequate. The 'meanings' of words
can be actually passed from one person to another, not because adequate
explanations are given, but because the other person already has some direct
perception-or 'awareness'-of what possible meanings there could be, so
very inadequate explanations can suffice to enable that person to 'latch on' to
the correct one. It is the possession of a common kind of 'awareness' that
allows the communication between the two people to take place. It is this that
puts an insentient computer-controlled robot at a severe disadvantage.
(Indeed, the very meaning of the concept of a word's 'meaning' is something
that we have some kind of direct conception of, and it is hard to see how one
could give any kind of adequate description of this concept to our insentient
robot.) Meanings can only be communicated from person to person because
each person is aware of similar internal experiences or feelings about things.
One might imagine that 'experiences' are just things that constitute some kind
of memory store that records what has happened, and that our robot could
54                        Consciousness and computation

easily be equipped with this. But I am arguing that this is not so, and that it is
crucial that the object in question, be it human or robot, must actually be
aware of the experience.
   Why do I claim that this 'awareness', whatever it is, must be something non­
computational, so that no robot, controlled by a computer, based merely on
the standard logical ideas of a Turing machine (or equivalent}-whether top­
down or bottom-up---can achieve or even simulate it? It is here that the
Godelian argument plays its crucial role. It is hard tt:) say much at the present
time about our 'awareness' of, for example, the colour red; but there is
something definite that we can say concerning our awareness of the infinitude
of natural numbers. It is 'awareness' that allows a child to 'know' what is
meant by the numbers 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', etc., and for what it
means for this sequence to go on for ever, when only absurdly limited, and
seemingly almost irrelevant, kinds of descriptions in terms of a few oranges
and bananas have been given. The concept of'three' can indeed be abstracted,
by a child, from such limited examples; and, moreover, the child can also latch
on to the fact that this concept is but one of the unending sequence of similar
concepts ('four', 'five', 'six', etc.). In some Platonic sense, the child already
'knows' what the natural numbers are.
   This may seem a bit mystical, but it is not really. It is vital, for the
discussions which follow, that we distinguish this kind of Platonic knowledge
from mysticism. The concepts that we 'know' in this Platonic sense are things
that are 'obvious' to us-they are things that can be reduced to a perceived
'common sense'-yet we may not be able to characterize these concepts
completely in terms of computational rules. Indeed, as we shall see from the
later discussion, in relation to the Godel argument, there is no way of
characterizing the properties of the natural numbers completely in terms of
such rules. Yet, how is it that descriptions of numbers in terms of apples or
bananas can allow a child to know what 'three days' means, that same abstract
concept of 'three' being involved as with 'three oranges'? Of course, this
appreciation may well not come at once, and the child may get it wrong at first,
but that is not the point. The point is that this kind of realization is possible at
all. The abstract concept of 'three', and of this concept as being one of an
infinite sequence of corresponding concepts-the natural numbers them­
selves-is something that can indeed be understood, but, I claim, only through
the use of one's awareness.
   My claim will be that, likewise, we are not using computational rules when
we visualize the motions of a block of wood, or of a piece of rope, or of
Abraham Lincoln. In fact there are very effective computer simulations of the
motions of a rigid body, such as a block of wood. The simulations of such
motions can be made so precise and reliable that they are usually far more
effective than what can be achieved by direct human visualization. Likewise,
the motions of a piece of rope, or string, can be simulated computationally,
although, perhaps surprisingly, this is something much more difficult to
                          Consciousness and computation                        55

achieve than the simulations of the motions of a rigid body. (This has partly to
do with the fact that a 'mathematical string' requires infinitely many
parameters to specify its location whereas a rigid body requires just six.) There
are computer algorithms for deciding whether or not a rope is knotted, but
these are completely different from those that describe rigid motions (and are
not very efficient computationally). Any computer simulation of the external
appearance of Abraham Lincoln would certainly be more difficult still. Now
my point is not that human visualization is 'better' or 'worse' than a computer
simulation of these various things, but that it is something quite different.
   An essential point, it seems to me, is that visualization involves an element
of appreciation of what it is that is being visualized; that is, it involves
understanding. To illustrate the kind of thing that I have in mind, consider an
elementary fact of arithmetic, namely the fact that, of any two natural numbers
(i.e. non-negative whole numbers: 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, . . . ) a and b, we have the
property that
                                  a x b = b x a.
It should be made clear that this is not an empty statement, for the meanings of
the two sides of the equation are different. On the left, a x b refers to a
collection of a groups of b objects; whereas b x a on the right refers to b groups
of a objects. In the particular case when a = 3 and b = 5 we have, for a x b, the
arrangement


whereas for b x a, we have


The fact that there are the same total number of spots in each case expresses
the particular fact that 3 x 5 = 5 x 3.
  Now we can see that this must be true simply by visualizing the array
                                 • • • • •
                                 • • • • •
                                 • • • • ••

If we read this off by rows, we find that we have three rows, each contaning five
spots, which expresses the quantity 3 x 5. However, if we read it off by
columns, we find five columns of three spots, expressing the quantity 5 x 3. The
fact that these quantities are equal is seen at once from the fact that it is
precisely the same rectangular array in each case; it is only being read off
differently. (Alternatively, one might prefer to rotate the image through a right
angle in one's mind's eye, to see that the array representing 5 x 3 has the same
number of elements as that representing 3 x 5.)
   Now the important thing about this act of visualization is that it at once
56                            Consciousness and computation

gives us something much more general than the particular numerical fact that
3 x 5 = 5 x 3. For there is nothing special about the particular values a = 3,
b = 5 in this procedure. It would equally apply if, say, a = 79797000222 and
b = 50000 123 555, and we can confidently assert
        79 797000222 X 50000 123 555 = 50000 123 555 X 79797000222
despite the fact that there is no chance of our accurately visualizing a
rectangular array that big (nor could any actual computer enumerate its
elements). We can perfectly well conclude that the above equality must hold­
or, indeed, that the general equality a x b = b x a must hold *-from essentially
the same visualization that we used for the special case 3 x 5 = 5 x 3. We merely
need to 'blur' in our minds the actual numbers of rows and columns that are
being used, and the equality becomes obvious.
   I do not mean to suggest that all mathematical relations can be perceived
directly as 'obvious' if they are visualized in the right way-or merely that they
can always be perceived in some other way that is immediate to our intuitions.
Far from it. Some mathematical relations require long chains of reasoning
before they can be perceived with certainty. But the object of mathematical
proof is, in effect, to provide such chains of reasoning where each step is indeed
something that can be perceived as obvious. Consequently, the endpoint ofthe
reasoning is something that must be accepted as true, even though it may not,
in itself, be at all obvious.
   One might imagine that it would be possible to list all possible 'obvious'
steps of reasoning once and for all, so that from then on everything could be
reduced to computation-i.e. the mere mechanical manipulation of these
obvious steps. What Godel's argument shows (§2.5) is that this is not possible.
There is no way of eliminating the need for new 'obvious' understandings.
Thus, mathematical understanding cannot be reduced to blind computation.



       1 .20 Mental visualization and virtual reality
The mathematical insights that featured in §1 .19 were of a rather specifically
geometrical character. There are also many other types of insight that can be
used in mathematical arguments-insights which need not be particularly
geometrical. However, it turns out that insights which are geometrical are
frequently of particular value towards mathematical understanding. Thus, it
may be instructive to ask what kind of physical activity is actually going on in
our brains when we visualize something in a geometrical way. There is no

         *It should be remarked that this equality does not hold for various strange kinds
      of 'numbers' that occur in mathematics, such as the ordinal numbers referred to
      after Q19 in §2 . 10 . But it always holds for the natural numbers, which are what we
      are concerned with here.
                          Consciousness and computation                          57

logical requirement that this activity should itself provide a 'geometrical
mirroring' of the thing that is being visualized. As we shall see, it could be
something quite different.
    It is helpful to make a comparison with what is called 'virtual reality',
something which has been argued as having relevance to the issue of
'visualization'. According to the procedures of virtual reality,2 7 a computer
simulation is made of some non-existent structure-such as an architectural
proposal for a building-and this simulation conveyed to the eyes of a human
subject who seems to perceive that structure as 'real'. Through movements of
the eyes or head, or perhaps even of the legs as though walking around, the
subject would see the structure from different angles, just as would be the case
if the structure were indeed real. (See Fig. 1 .8.) Some people28 have argued the




     Fig. 1 .8. Virtual reality. A three-dimensional make-believe world can be
     computationally conjured up which consistently responds to movement
                                 of the head and body.
58                       Consciousness and computation

case that whatever it is that goes on inside our brains when we consciously
visualize may well be very like the computations involved in the construction
of such a simulation. Indeed, in one's 'mind's eye', when one views some actual
fixed structure, one seems to construct some mental model which persists
unchanged despite continual movements of head, eyes, and body which entail
that the retinal images are continually shifting. Such corrections for bodily
motions are very much part of what is involved in virtual reality, and it has
been suggested that something very similar must be going on in the
construction of the 'mental models' that constitute our very acts of
visualization. Such computations, of course, need have no actual geometrical
relationship with (or 'mirroring' of) the structure that is being modelled.
Supporters of viewpoint .91 would indeed have to regard our conscious
visualizations as being the result of some such computational simulation,
inside our heads, of the external world. What I am proposing, however, is that
when we consciously perceive a visual scene, the understanding that is involved
is something very different from the modelling of the world in terms of such a
computational simulation.
   One might argue that something inside our brains is acting more like an
'analogue computer' where the modelling of the external world is achieved not
in terms of digital computation, as is the case with modern electronic
 computers, but in terms of some internal physical structure whose physical
behaviour can be translated so as to mirror the behaviour of the external
system that is being modelled. If we wish to make an analogue device to model
the motions of an external rigid body, there is clearly a very straightforward
way to do this. That would be to have, internally, a small actual physical body
 of the same shape as (but of a different size from) the external object that is
being modelled-although I shall certainly not suggest any direct relevance of
 this particular model to what goes on insiqe our brains! The motions of this
 internal body could be viewed from different angles to give outward effects
 very similar to that of digital computation. Such a system could also be used as
part of a 'virtual reality' system, where instead of having an entirely
 computational model of the structure in question, there would be an actual
 physical model of it, differing only by size from the 'reality' that is being
 simulated. In general, analogue simulation would not be so direct or so trivial
 as this. One might use a parameter such as electric potential rather than actual
 physical distance, and so on. One must just be sure that the physical laws that
 govern the internal structure mirror very precisely the physical laws governing
 the external structure that is being modelled. There is no need for the internal
 structure to resemble (or to 'mirror') the external one in any obvious way.
    Is it possible that analogue devices can achieve things inaccessible to pure
 digital computation? As was discussed in §1 .8, there is no reason to believe
 that, within the framework of present-day physics, analogue simulation can
 achieve things that digital simulation cannot. Thus, if our arguments indicate
 to us that our visual imaginations achieve non-computational things, then we
                          Consciousness and computation                          59

are encouraged to look outside the framework of existing physics for the
underpinnings of our visual imagination.


            1 .2 1 Is mathematical imagination non-
                              computational?
None of this discussion tells us specifically that whatever we do when we
visualize is something that cannot be simulated in a compuational way. It
might seem, even if we employ some kind of internal analogue system when we
visualize, that it ought at least to be possible to simulate, digitally, the
behaviour of such an analogue device.
   Now, the 'visualization' that I have just been referring to has been concerned
with what is 'visual' in a largely literal sense, i.e. with the mental images that
seem to correspond to the signals that reach the brain from our eyes. More
generally, one's mental images need not at all have this literally 'visual'
character, such as when one understands the meaning of an abstract word or
recalls a piece of music. The mental images of someone who has been blind
since birth, for example, can hardly have a direct relation to the signals that
one receives from the eyes. Thus, the 'visualizations' that I am referring to are
more concerned with the general issue of 'awareness' than with things that
necessarily relate to the visual system. In fact, I do not know of any argument
that has a direct bearing on the computational nature, or otherwise, of our
powers of visualization in this literal sense of'visual'. My belief that our actual
acts of visualization must indeed be non-computational is an inference from
the fact that other types of human awareness do seem to have a demonstrably
non-computational character. Though it is hard to see how one might produce
a direct argument for non-computability that is specific to geometric
visualization, a convincing argument that some forms of conscious awareness
must be non-computational would at least carry the strong suggestion that the
kind of awareness that is involved in geometric visualization ought to be non­
computational also. There seems no reason to believe that a clear line is to be
drawn between different manifestations of conscious understanding in this
respect.
   Specifically, the awareness that I claim is demonstrably non-computational
is our understanding of the properties of the natural numbers 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, . . ..
(One might even say that our concept of a natural number is, in a sense, a form
of non-geometric 'visualization'.) We shall see in §2.5, by a readily accessible
form ofGodel's theorem (cf. response to query Q16), that this understanding is
something that cannot be encapsulated in any finite set of rules-from which it
follows that it cannot be simulated computationally. From time to time one
hears that some computer system has been 'trained' so as to 'understand' the
concept of natural numbers. 2 9 However, this cannot be true, as we shall see. It
is our awareness of what a 'number' can actually mean that enables us to latch
60                       Consciousness and computation

on to the correct concept. When we have this correct concept, we can-at least
in principle--provide the correct answers to families of questions about
numbers that are put to us, when no finite set of rules can do this. With only
rules and no direct awareness, a computer-controlled robot (like Deep
Thought; cf. §1 . 1 5 above) would be necessarily limited in ways in which we are
not limited ourselves-although if we give the robot clever enough rules for its
behaviour it may perform prodigious feats, some of which lie far beyond
unaided human capabilities in specific narrowly enough defined areas, and it
might be able to fool us, for some while, into thinking that it also possesses
awareness.
   A point worth making is that when an effective digital (or analogue)
computer simulation of some external system is achieved, it is almost always
by taking advantage of some significant human understanding of the
underlying mathematical ideas. Consider the digital simulation of the
geometical motions of a rigid body. The relevant computations depend, most
particularly, upon the insights of some great thinkers of the seventeenth
century, such as the French mathematicians Descartes, Fermat, and
Desargues, who introduced the ideas of coordinate and projective geometry.
What about the simulation of the motions of a piece of string or rope? It turns
out that the geometrical ideas that are needed in order to understand the
restrictions of behaviour of a piece of string-i.e. its 'knottedness'-are very
sophisticated; and they are remarkably recent, many fundamental advances
having been achieved only in this century. While it may, in practice, be not too
difficult to decide, using simple manipulations with one's hands, and applying
one's common-sense understanding, whether or not a closed but tangled loop
of string is knotted or unknotted, the computational algorithms for achieving
the same feat are surprisingly involved, sophisticated, and inefficient.
   Thus, effective digital simulations of such things have been very much top­
down affairs, and they depend upon considerable human understanding and
insight. There is little chance that there is anything very similar going on in a
human brain when it is engaged in the act of visualization. A more plausible
possibility would be something involving an important contribution from
bottom-up ingredients, so that the simulated 'visual pictures' would arise only
after considerable 'learning experience' has taken place. I am not aware,
however, that there are any significant bottom-up approaches (e.g. from
artificial neural networks) to questions of this kind. My guess would be that an
approach that was entirely based on a bottom-up organization would give
very poor results. It is hard to see that a good simulation of the geometrical
motions of a rigid body or the topological restrictions on the motion of a piece
of string-i.e. its knotted ness--could be achieved without there being involved
any genuine understanding of what is actually going on.
   What kind of physical process can it be that is responsible for our
awareness-an awareness that seems to be necessary for any genuine
understanding? Can it indeed be something beyond computational simula-
                              Consciousness and computation                             61

tion, as is demanded by viewpoint C(f? Is this putative physical process
something that is itself accessible to our understanding, at least in principle? I
believe that it must be, and that viewpoint C(f is a genuine scientific possibility,
although we must be prepared for the eventuality that our scientific criteria
and methods may undergo subtle but important shifts. We shall have to be
prepared to examine clues that may present themselves in unexpected ways,
and in areas of genuine understanding that may at first appear to be largely
irrelevant. In the discussions that follow, I ask the reader to keep an open
mind, yet to pay careful attention to the reasoning and to the scientific
evidence, even though these may, at times, appear to conflict with what had
seemed obvious common sense. Be prepared to think a little about the
arguments that I shall endeavour to present in as clear a form as I am able.
Thus emboldened-let us venture forth.
   In the remainder of Part I, I shall be leaving aside the issues of physics and of
whatever biological action might underlie the non-computability demanded
by viewpoint C(f, Those matters will be the concern of Part II of this book. But
why is a search for non-computational action necessary? That necessity rests
on my claim that we indeed perform non-computational feats when we
consciously understand. I must justify this claim, and for this reason we must
turn to our mathematics.

      modelled (essentially that in the retina), together with an estimate of the rate at
      which computer technology will advance in the future. As of early 1 994, he is
      still holding to these estimates; cf. Moravec (1994).
 3.   These four viewpoints were explicitly described in, for example, Johnson-Laird
      ( 1987), p. 252 (although it should be pointed out that what he refers to as the
      'Church-Turing thesis' is essentially what I am calling 'Turing's thesis' in § 1 .6,
      rather than 'Church's thesis').

 7.   See Searle ( 1980), ( 1 992).
 8.   The issue is complicated by the fact that present-day physics depends upon the
      use of continuous, rather than discrete (digital) action. Even the meaning of
      'computability' in this context is open to various interpretations. For some
      relevant discussion, see Pour-el (1974), Smith and Stephenson ( 1 975), Pour-el
      and Richards ( 1 979), ( 1 98 1 ), ( 1982), ( 1 989), Blum, Shub, and Smale ( 1 989),

10. The subject of AI effectively started in the 1950s using comparatively
                                 J
      elementary top-down proce ures (e.g. Grey Walter 1953). The pattern
      recognizing 'perceptron', of Frank Rosenblatt (1962), in 1959, was the first
      successful 'connectionist' (artificial neural network) device, and this stimulated
      a great deal of interest in bottom-up schemes. However, some essential
      limitations of this type of bottom-up organization were pointed out in 1 969 by
      Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert (cf. Minsky and Papert 1972). These were
      later overcome by Hopfield (1982), and artificial devices of the neural network
      type are now the subject of a considerable world-wide activity. (See, for
      example, Beks and Hamker 1992 and Gernoth et al. 1993, for some
      applications to high-energy physics.) Important landmarks in top-down AI
      research were papers by John McCarthy (1979) and by Alan Newell and
      Herbert Simon (1976). See Freedman (1994) for a dramatic account of all this
      history. For other recent discussions of AI's procedures and prospects, see
      Grossberg (1987), Baars (1988); for a classic attack on the subject, see Dreyfus
      (1972); and for a recent viewpoint by an AI pioneer, Gelernter (1994); cf. also
      various articles in Broadbent (1993) and Khalfa (1994).

      ( 1974), Smith and Stephenson (1975), Pour-el and Richards (1989), Blumb,
      Shub, and Smale (1989). The question of brain activity in relation to these
      issues has been considered, in particular, by Rubel (1985).
13. In the case of the tiling problem, what Robert Berger actually proved was that
      the tiling problem for Wang tiles has no algorithmic general solution. Wang
      tiles (named after the logician Hao Wang) consist of single individual square
      tiles with coloured edges, where the colours must be matched tile-to-tile, and
      the tiles must not be rotated or reflected. However, it is an easy matter to
      devise, for any Wang tile set, a corresponding set of polyominoes that will tile
      the plane if and only if the given set of Wang tiles will do so. Thus the
      computational insolubility of the polyomino tiling problem follows immediately
      from that for Wang tiles.
         It is worth pointing out, in connection with the polyomino tiling problem,
      that if a given set of polyominoes fails to tile the plane, then this fact can be
      computationally ascertained (like when a Turing machine action halts, or when
      a set of Diophantine equations possesses a solution) since one can try to cover
      an n x n square region with the tiles, for successively larger values of n , the
      failure of the tiles to cover the entire plane showing up at some finite value of n.
      It is the situations for which the tiles do tile the plane which cannot be
      algorithmically ascertained.

                      The Godelian case




         2. 1 Godel's theorem and Turing machines
It is in mathematics that our thinking processes have their purest form. If
thinking is just carrying out a computation of some kind, then it might seem
that we ought to be able to see this most clearly in our mathematical thinking.
Yet, remarkably, the very reverse turns out to be the case. It is within
mathematics that we find the clearest evidence that there must actually be
something in our conscious thought processes that eludes computation. This
may seem to be a paradox-but it will be of prime importance in the
arguments which follow, that we come to terms with it.
   Before we start, let me encourage the reader not to be timid about the
mathematics that we shall encounter in the next few sections (§2.2-§2.5),
despite the fact that we must obtain some appreciation of the implications of
no less than the most important theorem in mathematical logic of all time-­
the famous theorem of Kurt GOdel. I shall present only an extremely simplified
version of that theorem, drawing, particularly, upon the slightly later ideas of
Alan Turing. No mathematical formalism other than the simplest arithmetic
will be used. The argument that I shall give will admittedly be confusing in
places, but it will be merely confusing, and not actually 'difficult' in the sense of
any prior mathematical knowledge being required. Take the argument as
slowly as you wish and do not be ashamed to reread it as many times as you
want to. Later on (§2.6-§2.10) I shall explore some of the more specific insights
that underlie Godel's theorem, but the reader who is not interested in such
matters need not be concerned with those p3;rts of this book.
   What did GOdel's theorem achieve? It was in 1930 that the brilliant young
mathematician Kurt GOdel startled a group of the world's leading mathemati­
cians and logicians, at a meeting in Konigsberg, with what was to become his
famous theorem. It rapidly became accepted as being a fundamental
contribution to the foundations of mathematics-probably the most funda­
mental ever to be found-but I shall be arguing that in establishing his
theorem, he also initiated a major step forward in the philosophy of mind.
   Among the things that Godel indisputably established was that no formal
                                 The Godelian case                               65

system of sound mathematical rules of proof can ever suffice, even in principle,
to establish all the true propositions of ordinary arithmetic. This is certainly
remarkable enough. But a powerful case can also be made that his results
showed something more than this, and established that human understanding
and insight cannot be reduced to any set of computational rules. For what he
appears to have shown is that no such system of rules can ever be sufficient to
prove even those propositions of arithmetic whose truth is accessible, in
principle, to human intuition and insight-whence human intuition and
insight cannot be reduced to any set of rules. It will be part of my purpose here
to try to convince the reader that Godel's theorem indeed shows this, and
provides the foundation of my argument that there must be more to human
thinking than can ever be achieved by a computer, in the sense that we
understand the term 'computer' today.
   It is not necessary for me to give a definition of a 'formal system' for the
central argument (but see §2. 7). Instead, I shall take advantage of the
fundamental contribution of Turing in about 1936 (and some others,
primarily Church and Post) which laid down the kinds of processes that we
now call 'computations' or 'algorithms'. There is an effective equivalence
between such processes and what can be achieved by a mathematical formal
system, so it will not be important to know what a formal system actually is,
provided that we have a reasonably clear idea of what is meant by a
computation or an algorithm. Even for this, a rigorous definition will not be
necessary.
   Those readers familiar with my earlier book The Emperor's New Mind
(ENM, cf. Chapter 2) will know that an algorithm is what can be carried out
by a Turing machine, where we may think of a Turing machine as a
mathematically idealized computer. It carries out its activities in a step-by­
step procedure, each step being completely specified in terms of the nature of
the mark on a 'tape' that the machine happens to be examining at each
moment, and on the machine's (discretely defined) 'internal state'. The
different allowed internal states are finite in number, and the total number of
marks on the tape must also be finite-though the tape itself is unlimited in
length. The machine starts in a particular state, say the one labelled '0' and its
instructions are fed in on the tape, say in the form of a binary number
(sequence of'O's and ' 1 's ). It then starts reading these instructions, moving the
tape (or, equivalently, moving itself along the tape) in a definite way according
to its step-by-step inbuilt procedures, as is determined at each stage by its
internal state and the particular digit that it happens to be examining. It erases
marks, or makes new ones, also according to these procedures. It continues in
this way until it reaches a particular instruction: 'STOP'-at which point (and
only at which point) the answer to the computation that it has been
performing is displayed on the tape, and the activity of the machine is
terminated. It is now ready to perform its next computation.
   Certain particular Turing machines are referred to as universal Turing
66                                 The Godelian case

machines, these being Turing machines which have the capability of imitating
any Turing machine whatever. Thus any single universal Turing machine has
the capability of carrying out any computation (or algorithm) that one may
care to specify. Although a modern computer's detailed internal construction
is very different from this (and its internal 'working space', though very large, is
not infinite like the Turing machine's idealized tape), all modern general­
purpose computers are, in effect, actually universal Turing machines.

                            2.2 Computations
We shall be concerned here with computations. By a computation (or
algorithm) I indeed mean the action of some Turing machine, i.e. in effect, just
the operation of a computer according to some computer program. It should
be realized that computations are not merely the performing of ordinary
operations of arithmetic, such as just adding or multiplying numbers together,
but can involve other things also. Well-defined logical operations can also be
part of a computation. For an example of a computation, we might consider
the following task:
(A) Find a number that is not the sum of three square numbers.
By 'number', I mean here a 'natural number', i.e. one of
                   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1 , 12, . . ..
A square number is the product of a natural number with itself, i.e. one of
                            0, 1 , 4, 9, 16 , 25 , 36, . . . ,
these being
       0 X 0 = 02 , 1 X 1 1 2 , 2 X 2 2 2 , 3 X 3 = 3 2 , 4 X 4 = 42 , 5 X 5 = 5 2 ,
                          =            =


                                   6 X 6 = 62 , ,•   •   •




respectively. Such numbers are called 'square' because they can be represented
as square arrays (including the vacuous array, to represent 0):
                                                  * * * *
                                           * * *  * * * *
                        * *                * * *'
                *'      * *                       * * * *
                                           * * *  * * * *
   The computation (A) could then proceed as follows. We try each natural
number in turn, starting with 0, to see whether or not it is the sum of three
squares. We need only consider squares that are no larger than the number
itself. Thus, for each natural number, there are only finitely many square
numbers to try. As soon as three square numbers are found that do add to it,
then our computation moves on to the next natural number, and we try again
                                    The Godelian case                                    67

to find a triplet of squares (each no greater than the number itself) that sum to
it. Our computation stops only when a natural number is found for which each
such triplet of squares fails to add to it. To see how this works, start with 0.
This is 0 2 + 0 2 + 0 2 , so it is indeed the sum of three squares. Next we try 1 and
we find that although it is not 0 2 + 02 + 02 it is indeed 0 2 + 02 + 1 2 . Our
computation tells us now to move on to 2 and we ascertain that although it is
not 0 2 + 0 2 + 0 2 or 0 2 + 0 2 + 1 2 , it is indeed 0 2 + 1 2 + 1 2 ; we then move on to 3
and find 3 = 1 2 + 1 2 + 1 2 ; then to 4, finding 4 = 0 2 + 0 2 + 2 2 ; then 5 =
02 + 1 2 + 2 2 ; then after finding 6 = 1 2 + 1 2 + 2 2 we move on to 7, but now all
triplets of squares (each member no greater than 7)
      0 2 + 0 2 + 0 2 . 02 + 0 2 + 1 2 . 02 + 02 + 2 2 . 02 + 1 2 + 1 2 . 0 2 + 1 2 + 2 2 .
      02 + 2 2 + 2 2 . 1 2 + 1 2 + 1 2 . 1 2 + 1 2 + 22 . 1 2 + 22 + 22 . 22 + 22 + 22 .
 fail to sum to 7, so the computation halts and we reach our conclusion: 7 is a
 number of the kind we seek, being not the sum of three squares.


                      2 . 3 Non-stopping computations
  However, with the computation (A) we were lucky. Suppose we had tried,
  instead, the computation:
  (B) Find a number that is not the sum of four square numbers.
  Now when we reach 7 we find that it is the sum of four squares:
  7 = 1 2 + 1 2 + 1 2 + 2 2 , so we must move on to 8, finding 8 = 02 + 0 2 + 2 2 + 2 2 ,
  then to 9, finding 9 = 0 2 + 0 2 + 0 2 + 3 2 , then 10 = 02 + 02 + 1 2 + 3 2 , etc. The
  computation goes on and on: . . . 23 1 2 + 2 2 + 3 2 + 3 2 , 24 = 02 + 2 2 + 2 2 + 4 2 ,
                                           =




  . . . , 359 = 1 2 + 3 2 + 5 2 + 18 2 . . . , and on and on. We may decide that the
  answer to our computation is unbelievably large, and that our computer is
  going to take an enormously long time and use a huge amount of storage space
  in order to find the answer. In fact we may begin to wonder whether there is
  any answer at all. The computation appears to continue and continue, and it
  never seems to stop. In fact this is correct; it never does! It is a famous theorem
  first proved by the great (Italian-)French mathematician Joseph L. Lagrange
  in 1770 that every number is, indeed, the sum of four squares. It is not such an
  easy theorem (and even Lagrange's contemporary, the great Swiss mathemat­
  ician Leonhard Euler, a man of astounding mathematical insight, originality,
  and productiveness, had tried but failed to find a proof).
      I am certainly not going to trouble the reader with the details of Lagrange's
. argument here, so let us instead try something very much simpler:
  (C) Find an odd number that is the sum of two even numbers.
  I hope that it is obvious to the reader that this computation will never come to
  an end! Even numbers, namely the multiples of two
68                               The Godelian case

                        0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, . . . ,
always add up to even numbers, so there can certainly be no odd number, i.e.
one of the rest
                        1 , 3, 5, 7, 9, 1 1 , 13, 15, 17, . . . ,
that is the sum of a pair of even numbers.
   I have given two examples ((B) and (C)) of computations that never
terminate. In one case this fact, though true, is not at all easy to ascertain,
whilst in the other, its non-termination is really obvious. Let me give another
example:
(D) Find an even number, greater than 2, that is not the sum of two prime
numbers.
Recall that a prime number is a natural number (other than 0 or 1 ) that has no
factors other than itself or 1, so it is one of:
                       2, 3, 5, 7, 1 1 , 13, 17, 19, 23, . . ..
It is very likely that the computation (D) does not terminate either, but
nobody knows for sure. It depends upon the truth of the famous 'Goldbach
conjecture', put forward by Goldbach in a letter to Euler in 1742, but which
remains unproved to this day.


   2 .4 How do we decide that some computations do
                                 not stop?
We now see that computations may or may not terminate and, moreover, in
the cases when they do not terminate it may be easy to see that they do not, or
it may be very hard, or it may even be so hard that no one has as yet been clever
enough to ascertain this fact for sure. By what procedures do mathematicians
convince themselves or convince others that certain computations do not in
fact terminate? Are they themselves following some computational (or
algorithmic) procedure in order to ascertain things of this kind? Before
attempting to answer this question, let us consider yet another example. This
example will be somewhat more difficult to see than our obvious (C) but still
very much easier than (B). I shall try to illustrate something of the way in
which mathematicians may sometimes reach their conclusions.
   My example involves what are called hexagonal numbers:
                          1, 7, 19, 37, 61, 91, 127, . . . ,
namely the numbers that can be arranged as hexagonal arrays (this time,
excluding the vacuous array):

These numbers can be obtained, starting from 1 , by adding successive
multiples of 6:
                                       6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, . . . ,
as can be seen by observing that each hexagonal number can be obtained from
the one before it by adding a hexagonal ring around its border
                                                          •       •       •       •

and noting that the number of spots in this ring must be a multiple of 6, the
multiplier increasing by 1 each time, as the hexagon gets larger.
  Now let us add together the hexagonal numbers successively, up to a certain
point, starting with 1 . What do we find?
1 = 1 , 1 + 7 = 8, 1 + 7 + 19 = 27, 1 + 7 + 19 + 37 = 64, 1 + 7 + 19 + 37 + 61 = 125.
What is special about the numbers 1, 8, 27, 64, 125? They are all cubes. A cube
is a number multiplied by itself three times:
    1 = 1 3 = 1 X 1 X 1 , 8 = 2 3 = 2 X 2 X 2, 27 = 3 3 = 3 X 3 X 3, 64 = 4 3 = 4 X 4 X 4,
                                          125 = 5 3 = 5 X 5 X 5, . . ..
Is this a general property of hexagonal numbers? Let us try the next case. We
indeed find
                            1 + 7 + 19 + 37 + 61 + 91 = 216 = 6 X 6 X 6 = 6 3 •
Is this going to go on literally for ever? If so, then the following computation
will never terminate:
(E) Find a sum of successive hexagonal numbers, starting from 1 , that is not a
cube.

I am going to try to convince you that this computation will indeed continue
for ever without stopping.
   First of all, a cube is called a cube because it is a number that can be
represented as a cubic array of points as depicted in Fig. 2. 1 . I want you to try
to think of such an array as built up successively, starting at one corner and
then adding a succession of three-faced arrangements each consisting of a back
wall, side wall, and ceiling, as depicted in Fig. 2.2.
   Now view this three-faced arrangement from a long way out, along the
direction of the corner common to all three faces. What do we see? A hexagon
as in Fig. 2.3. The marks that constitute these hexagons, successively
increasing in size, when taken together, correspond to the marks that
constitute the entire cube. This, then, establishes the fact that adding together
successive hexagonal numbers, starting with 1 , will always give a cube.
Accordingly, we have indeed ascertained that (E) will never stop.
   The reader may worry that the argument that I have just given is somewhat
intuitive, instead of being a formal rigorous mathematical demonstration. In
fact the argument is perfectly sound, and part of my purpose here is to show
that there are sound methods of mathematical reasoning that are not
'formalized' according to some accepted preassigned system of rules. A much
more elementary example of geometrical reasoning, used to obtain a general
property of�·atural numbers, is the proof that a x b = b x a given in §1 . 19. This,
also, is a perfectly good 'proof, though not a formal one.
   The reasoning that I have just given for the summing of successive
hexagonal numbers could be replaced by a more formal mathematical
demonstration if desired. The essential part of such a formal demonstration
might be the principle of mathematical induction, which is a procedure for

ascertainin.g the truth of statements that apply to all natural numbers on the
basis of a single computation. In essence, it enables us to deduce that a
proposition P(n), that depends on a particular natural number n (such as 'the
sum of the first n hexagonal numbers is n 3 '), holds for every n, provided that we
can show, first, that it holds for n = O (or, here, n = 1 ) and that we can also show
that the truth of P(n) implies the truth of P(n + 1 ) . I shall not bother the reader
with the details of how one would prove that (E) never stops, using
mathematical induction, but the interested reader might like to try this as an
exercise.
   Are clear-cut rules, like the principle of mathematical induction, always
sufficient to establish the non-stopping nature of computations that in fact do
not stop? The answer, surprisingly, is 'no'. This is one of the implications of
G6del's theorem, as we shall see shortly, and it will be important that we try to
understand it. It is not just mathematical induction that is insufficient. Any set
of rules whatever will be insufficient, if by a 'set of rules' we mean some system
of formalized procedures for which it is possible to check entirely computa­
tionally, in any particular case, whether or not the rules have been correctly
applied. This may seem a pessimistic conclusion, for it appears to imply that
there are computations that never stop, yet the fact that they never stop cannot
ever be rigorously mathematically ascertained. However, this is not at all what
G6del's theorem actually tells us. What it does tell us can be viewed in a much
more positive light, namely that the insights that are available to human
mathematicians-indeed, to anyone who can think logically with understand­
ing and imagination-lie beyond anything that can be formalized as a set of
rules. Rules can sometimes be a partial substitute for understanding, but they
can never replace it entirely.


       2 . 5 Families of computations ; the Godel-Turing
                                  conclusion C§
In order to see how G6del's theorem (in the simplified form that I shall give,
stimulated also by Turing's ideas) demonstrates this, we shall need a slight
generalization of the kind of statements about computations that I have been
considering. Instead of asking whether or not a single computation, such as
(A), (B), (C), (D), or (E), ever terminates, we shall need to consider a
computation that depends on--or acts upon-a natural number n. Thus, if we
call such a computation C(n), we can think of this as providing us with afamily
of computations, where there is a separate computation for each natural
number 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, . . . , namely the computation C(O), C(l }, C(2), C(3), C(4),
. . . , respectively, and where the way in which the computation depends upon n
is itself entirely computational.
    In terms of Turing machines, all that this means is that C(n) is the action of
some Turing machine on the number n. That is, the number n is fed in on the
                                       The Godelian case                                           73

machine's tape as input, and the machine just computes on its own from then
on. If you do not feel comfortable with the concept of a 'Turing machine', just
think of an ordinary general-purpose computer, and regard n as merely
providing the 'data' for the action of some programmed computer. What we
are interested in is whether or not this computer action ever stops, for each
choice of n.
  In order to clarify what is meant by a computation depending on a natural
number n, let us consider two examples:
(F) Find a number that is not the sum of n square numbers
and
(G) Find an odd number that is the sum of n even numbers.
It should be clear from what has been said above that the computation (F) will
stop only when n = O, 1 , 2, and 3 (finding the numbers 1 , 2, 3, and 7,
respectively, in these cases), and that (G) stops for no value ofn whatever. If we
are actually to ascertain that (F) does not stop when n is 4 or larger we require
some formidable mathematics (Lagrange's proof); on the other hand, the fact
that (G) does not stop for any n is obvious. What are the procedures that are
available to mathematicians for ascertaining the non-stopping nature of such
computations generally? Are these very procedures things that can be put into
a computational form?
   Suppose, then, that we have some computational procedure A which, when
it terminates, * provides us with a demonstration that a computation such as
C(n) actually does not ever stop. We are going to try to imagine that A
encapsulates all the procedures available to human mathematicians for
convincingly demonstrating that computations do not stop. Accordingly, if in
any particular case A itself ever comes to an end, this would provide us with a
demonstration that the particular computation that it refers to does not ever
stop. For most of the following argument, it is not necessary that A be viewed
as having this particular role. We are just concerned with a bit of mathematical
reasoning. But for our ultimate conclusion '§, we are indeed trying to imagine
that A has this status.
   I am certainly not requiring that A can always decide that C(n) does not stop
when in fact it does not, but I do insist that A does not ever give us wrong
answers, i.e. that if it comes to the conclusion that C(n) does not stop, then in
fact it does not. If A does not in fact give us wrong answers, we say that A is
sound.
  It should be noted that if A were actually unsound, then it would be possible
         *For the purposes of this argument, I am adopting the viewpoint that if A
      terminates at all, then this is to signal the achievement of a successful demonstration
      that C(n) never stops. If A were to 'get stuck' for any other reason than 'success' in its
      demonstration, then this would have to qualify as a failure of A to terminate
      properly. See queries Q3, Q4 below, and also Appendix A (p. 1 1 7).
74                                   The Godelian case

in principle to ascertain this fact by means of some direct calculation-i.e. an
unsound A is computationally falsifiable. For if A were to assert erroneously
that the computation C(n) does not ever terminate when in fact it does, then
the performing of the actual computation C(n) would eventually lead to a
refutation of A . (The issue of whether such a computation could ever be
performed in practice is a separate matter: it will be discussed under Q8.)
   In order for A to apply to computations generally, we shall need a way of
coding all the different computations C(n) so that A can use this coding for its
action. All the possible different computations C can in fact be listed, say as


and we can refer to Cq as the qth computation. When such a computation is
appl!ed to a particular number n, we shall write


We can take this ordering as being given, say, as some kind of numerical
ordering of computer programs. (To be explicit, we could, if desired, take this
ordering as being provided by the Turing-machine numbering given in ENM,
so that then the computation Cq(n) is the action of the qth Turing machine Tq
acting on n.) One technical thing that is important here is that this listing is
computable, i.e. there is a single* computation c. that gives us Cq when it is
presented with q, or, more precisely, the computation c. acts on the pair of
numbers q, n (i.e. q followed by n) to give Cq(n).
  The procedure A can now be thought of as a particular computation that,
when presented with the pair of numbers q, n, tries to ascertain that the
computation Cq(n) will never ultimately halt. Thus, when the computation A
terminates, we shall have a demonstration that Cq(n) does not halt. Although,
as stated earlier, we are shortly going to try to imagine that A might be a
formalization of all the procedures that are available to human mathemati­
cians for validly deciding that computations never will halt, it is not at all
necessary for us to think of A in this way just now. A is just any sound set of
computational rules for ascertaining that some computations Cq(n) do not
ever halt. Being dependent upon the two numbers q and n, the computation
that A performs can be written A(q, n), and we have:
(H) If A (q,   n) stops, then Cq(n) does not stop.
Now let us consider the particular statements (H) for which q is put equal to n.
This may seem an odd thing to do, but it is perfectly legitimate. (This is the first
step in the powerful 'diagonal slash', a procedure discovered by the highly
original and influential nineteenth-century Danish/Russian/German mathe-
        *In fact this is achieved precisely by the action of a universal Turing machine on
      the pair of numbers q, n; see Appendix A and ENM, pp . 5 1-7.

matician Georg Cantor, central to the arguments of both Godel and Turing.)
With q equal to n, we now have:
(I) If A(n,n) stops, then Cn (n) does not stop.
We now notice that A(n, n) depends upon just one number n, not two, so it
must be one ofthe computations C0, C 1 , C2 , C3 , (as applied to n ), since this

was supposed to be a listing of all the computations that can be performed on a
single natural number n. Let us suppose that it is in fact Ck, so we have:
(J)   A(n, n) = Ck(n).
Now examine the particular value n = k. (This is the second part of Cantor's
diagonal slash! ) We have, from (J),
(K) A(k, k ) = Ck (k )
and, from (I), with n = k:
(L) If A (k ,   k) stops, then Ck (k ) does not stop.
Substituting (K) in (L), we find:
(M) If Ck(k) stops, then Ck (k ) does not stop.
From this, we must deduce that the computation Ck (k ) does not in fact stop.
(For if it did then it does not, according to (M) !) But A (k , k) cannot stop either,
since by (K), it is the same as Ck(k). Thus, our procedure A is incapable of
ascertaining that this particular computation Ck (k ) does not stop even though
it does not.
   Moreover, if we know that A is sound, then we know that Ck (k ) does not
stop. Thus, we know something that A is unable to ascertain. It follows that A
cannot encapsulate our understanding.
   At this point, the cautious reader might wish to read over the whole
argument again, as presented above, just to make sure that I have not indulged
in any 'sleight of hand'! Admittedly there is an air of the conjuring trick about
the argument, but it is perfectly legitimate, and it only gains in strength the
more minutely it is examined. We have found a computation Ck (k ) that we
know does not stop; yet the given computational procedure A is not powerful
enough to ascertain that fact. This is the Godel(-Turing) theorem in the form
that I require. It applies to any computational procedure A whatever for
ascertaining that computations do not stop, so long as we know it to be sound.
We deduce that no knowably sound set of computational rules (such as A ) can
ever suffice for ascertaining that computations do not stop, since there are
some non-stopping computations (such as Ck (k )) that must elude these rules.
Moreover, since from the knowledge of A and of its soundness, we can actually
construct a computation Ck(k ) that we can see does not ever stop, we deduce
that A cannot be a formalization of the procedures available to mathemat-
76                              The Godelian case

icians for ascertaining that computations do not stop, no matter what A is.
Hence:

':§ Human mathematicians are not using a knowably sound algorithm in
order to ascertain mathematical truth.

It seems to me that this conclusion is inescapable. However, many people have
tried to argue against it-bringing in objections like those summarized in the
queries Ql-Q20 of §2.6 and §2.10 below-and certainly many would argue
against the stronger deduction that there must be something fundamentally
non-computational in our thought processes. The reader may indeed wonder
what on earth mathematical reasoning like this, concerning the abstract
nature of computations, can have to say about the workings of the human
mind. What, after all, does any of this have to do with the issue of conscious
awareness? The answer is that the argument indeed says something very
significant about the mental quality of understanding-in relation to the
general issue of computation-and, as was argued in § 1 .12, the quality of
understanding is something dependent upon conscious awareness. It is true
that, for the most part, the foregoing reasoning has been presented as just a
piece of mathematics, but there is the essential point that the algorithm A
enters the argument at two quite different levels. At the one level, it is being
treated as just some algorithm that has certain properties, but at the other, we
attempt to regard A as being actually 'the algorithm that we ourselves use' in
coming to believe that a computation will not stop. The argument is not simply
about computations. It is also about how we use our conscious understanding
in order to infer the validity of some mathematical claim-here the non­
stopping character of Ck(k). It is the interplay between the two different levels
at which the algorithm A is being considered-as a putative instance of
conscious activity and as a computation itself-that allows us to arrive at a
conclusion expressing a fundamental conflict between such conscious activity
and mere computation.
   However, there are indeed various possible loopholes and counter­
arguments that must be considered. First, in the remainder of this chapter, I
 shall go very carefully through all the relevant counter-arguments against the
conclusion ':§ that have come to my attention-these are the queries Ql-Q20,
that will be addressed in §2.6 and §2. 10, which also include a few additional
counter-arguments of my own. Each of these will be answered as carefully as I
 am able. We shall see that the conclusion ':§ comes through essentially
 unscathed. Then, in Chapter 3, I shall consider the implications of':§ itself. We
 shall find that it indeed provides the basis for a very powerful case that
 conscious mathematical understanding cannot be properly modelled at all in
 computational terms, whether top-down or bottom-up or any combination of
 the two. Many people might find this to be an alarming conclusion, as it may
 seem to have left us with nowhere to turn. In Part II of this book I shall take a

more positive line. I shall make what I believe to be a plausible scientific case
for my own speculations about the physical processes that might conceivably
underlie brain action, such as when we follow through an argument of this
kind, and how this might indeed elude any computational description.

            2.6 Possible technical objections to <'§
The reader may feel that the conclusion f§ is itself quite a startling one,
especially considering the simple nature of the ingredients of the argument
whereby it is derived. Before we move on to consider, in Chapter 3, its
implications with regard to the possibility of building a computer-controlled,
intelligent, mathematics-performing robot, we must examine a number of
technical points concerning the deduction of f§ very carefully. If you are a
reader who is not concerned with such possible technical loopholes and are
prepared to accept the conclusion f'§-that mathematicians are not using a
knowably sound algorithm to ascertain mathematical truth-then you may
prefer to skip these arguments (for the moment at least) and pass directly on to
Chapter 3; moreover, if you are prepared to accept the stronger conclusion
that there can be no algorithmic explanation at all for our mathematical or
other understandings, then you may prefer to pass directly on to Part 11-
perhaps pausing only to examine the fantasy dialogue of §3.23 (which
summarizes the essential arguments of Chapter 3) and the conclusions of
 §3.28.
   There are several points about the mathematics that tend to worry people
about the type of GOdel argument given in §2.5. Let us try to sort these out.
Qt. I have taken A to be just a single procedure, whereas we undoubtedly use
many difFerent kinds of reasoning in our mathematical arguments. Should we not
have aUowed for a whole list of possible 'A's?
   In fact, there is no loss of generality in phrasing things in the way that I have
done. Any finite list A 1 , A2, A 3, , A, of algorithmic procedures can always
                                   •   •   •



be re-expressed as a single algorithm A, in such a way that A will fail to stop
only if all the individual algorithms A 1 , , A, fail to stop. (The procedure of A
                                               .   .   •



might run roughly as follows: 'Do the first 10 steps of A 1 ; remember the result;
do the first 10 steps of A2; remember the result; do the first 10 steps of A 3 ;
remember the result; and s o on, up t o A,; then g o back t o A 1 and d o its second
set of 10 steps; remember the result; and so on; then the third set of 10 steps,
etc. Stop as soon as any ofthe A, stops.') If, on the other hand, the list of the A
were infinite, then in order for it to count as an algorithmic procedure, there
would have to be a way of generating this entire set A 1 , A2, A 3 ,   •   •in some
                                                                               •



algorithmic way. Then we can obtain a single A that will do in place of the
entire list in the following way:
                               'first 10 steps of A 1 ;
78                                 The Godelian case

                  second 10 steps of A 1 , first 10 steps of A 2 ;
       third 10 steps of A 1 , second 10 steps of A 2 , first 10 steps of A 3 ;
                                   . . . etc . . . .'.
This will stop as soon as any one in the list successfully terminates, and not
otherwise.
   One might, on the other hand, imagine that the list A 1 , A 2 , A 3, , which we
                                                                            •   •   •



take to be infinite, is not provided ahead of time, even in principle. One might
envisage that successive algorithmic procedures might be added to the list
from time to time, without the list having been originally specified in its
entirety. However, in the absence of any previous laid-down algorithmic
procedure for generating this list, we do not really have a self-contained
procedure at all.
Q2. Surely we must aUow that the algorithm A might not be fixed? Human
beings can learn, after all, so the algorithm that humans use might be a
continually changing one.
    A changing algorithm would need some specification as to the rules
whereby it actually changes. If these rules are themselves entirely algorithmic,
then we should have already included these very rules in what we mean by 'A';
so this kind of 'changing algorithm' is really just another instance of a single
algorithm, and the argument proceeds precisely as before. On the other hand,
one might envisage ways in which the algorithm could change that are
supposed to be not algorithmic, and suggestions for this might be: the
incorporation of random ingredients or some kind of interaction with the
environment. The 'non-algorithmic' status of such a means of changing an
algorithm will be reconsidered later (cf. §3.9, §3. 10); see also the discussion of
 §1 .9, where it was argued that neither of these means provides a plausible
escape from algorithmism• (as would be required by viewpoint fl). For our
present purely mathematical purposes, we are concerned only with the
possibility that the change is indeed algorithmic. But once we have accepted
that such a change cannot be algorithmic, then we have certainly come into
agreement with the conclusion C§.
    Perhaps I should be a little more explicit about what one might mean by an
'algorithmically changing' algorithm A. We may suppose that A depends upon
not only q and n, but also a further parameter t, which we may think of as
representing the 'time', or perhaps t just counts the number of occasions on
which the algorithm has been activated previously. In any case, we may as well
assume that the parameter t is a natural number, so we now have algorithms
A,(q, n), which we can list
                    A0(q, n), A 1 (q, n), A 2 (q, n), A 3 (q, n), . . . ,
        *The appropriate word 'algorithmism' for (essentially) my 'viewpoint d' has
      been coined by Hao Wang (1993).

where each is supposed to be a sound procedure for ascertaining that the
computation Cq(n) does not stop, but where we imagine that these procedures
are allowed to be increasing in power as t gets larger. Now the means whereby
they increase in power is supposed to be algorithmic. Perhaps this 'algorithmic
means' is something that might depend upon the 'experiences' of the previous
A1(q, n), but these 'experiences' are here being taken to be algorithmically
generated things also (or else we are back in agreement with �), so we may as
well include them, or their means of generation, into what constitutes the next
algorithm (i.e. into A1(q, n) itself). In this way, we arrive at a single algorithm
(Ar(q, n)) that depends algorithmically on all three parameters t, q, n. From
this, we can construct an algorithm A* that is as powerful as the entire list of
A1(q, n), but which depends on just the two natural numbers q and n. To
construct this A*(q, n), all we need, as above, is to let it run through the first 10
steps of A0(q, n), remember the result; then the first 10 steps of A 1 (q, n),
followed by the second 10 steps of A0(q, n), remembering the results; then the
first 10 of A 2 (q, n), the second 10 of A 1 (q, n), and the third 10 of A0(q, n); etc.,
where at each stage we remember the previous results; finally, we come to a
halt as soon as any of the constituent computations comes to a halt. Using A*
in place of A, the argument establishing � proceeds just as before.

Q3. Have I not been unnecessarily narrow ih insisting that A must go on
computing for ever in those cases when it may have become clear that C9(n)
actually does stop? If we allowed A actually to stop in those cases, our argument
would fail. The insights that are available to human beings, after all, certainly do
allow them sometimes to conclude that computations stop, but I seem to have
ignored these. Does this not mean that I have been too restrictive?

   Not at all. The argument is supposed to be applied merely to insights that
allow us to come to the conclusion that computations do not stop, not to those
insights that allow us to conclude the opposite. The putative algorithm A is
not allowed to come to a 'successful termination' by concluding that some
computation does stop. That is not its job.
   If you feel uncomfortable with this, think of A in the following way: try to
include both types of insight in A, but in those circumstances when the
conclusion is that the computation Cq(n) does stop, deliberately put A into a
loop (i.e. make A just repeat some operation over and over again endlessly). Of
course that is not the way that a mathematician would actually operate, but
that is not the point. The argument has the form of a reductio ad absurdum,
starting from the assumption that we use a knowably sound algorithm for
ascertaining mathematical truth, and then deriving a contradiction. It is not
necessary, in this argument, that A actually be this putative algorithm, but it
can be something constructed from it, such as in the case of the A just referred
to.
   The same comment would apply to any other objection to the argument of
80                              The Godelian case

§2.5 of the form: 'surely A might stop for various spurious reasons without it
having provided a demonstration that Cq(n) does not stop'. If we are given an
'A' that behaves in this way, we simply apply our argument of §2.5 to a slightly
different A, namely one that loops whenever the original 'A' stops for any such
spurious reason.
Q4. In the numbering C.., C1, Cv    , I seem to have assumed that every C,
                                    •   •   •



actually denotes a well-defined computation; whereas in any straightforward
numerical or alphabetical-type ordering of computer programs, surely this
would not be likely to be the case?

   It would indeed be an awkward thing to ensure that our numbering actually
provides a working computation C9 for every natural number q. For example,
the numbering of Turing machines Tq given in ENM certainly does not
achieve this; cf. ENM, p. 54. For a specified q , the Turing machine T,, as
described there, would be considered to be a 'dud' for one of four reasons: it
could run on for ever without stopping; it could be 'not correctly specified'
because the number n leads to a binary expansion with too many l s in
succession (five or more), and therefore would have no translation in the given
scheme; it could encounter an instruction to enter a non-existent internal
state; or it could produce just blank tape, when it stops, which has no
numerical interpretation. (See also Appendix A.) For the purposes of the
Godel-Turing argument that I have just given, all that one needs to do is to
lump all these reasons together under the heading 'does not stop'. In
particular, when I said 'terminates' for the computational procedure A (cf.
footnote, p. 73), this carries the implication that it indeed 'stops' in the
aforementioned sense (and so does not contain untranslatable sequences or
produce just blank tape )-i.e. 'stops' implies that the computation is indeed a
properly specified working computation. Likewise, 'C,(n) stops' means also
that it properly stops in this sense. With this interpretation, the argument, as I
have given it, is unaffected by consideration Q4.
QS. Have not I merely shown that it is possible to outdo just a particular
algorithmic procedure, A, by defeating it with the computation C,(n)? Why does
this show that I can do better than any A whatsoever?

  The argument certainly does show that we can do better than any algorithm.
This is the whole point of a reductio ad absurdum argument of this kind that I
have used here. I think that an analogy might be helpful here. Some readers
will know of Euclid's argument that there is no largest prime number. This,
also, is a reductio ad absurdum. Euclid's argument is as follows. Suppose, on
the contrary, that there is a largest prime; call it p. Now consider the product N
of all the primes up to p and add 1 :
                           N= 2 x 3 x 5 x . . x p + l .
                                                ·
                                     The Godelian case                                     81

N is  certainly larger than p, but it cannot be divisible by any of the prime
numbers 2, 3, 5, . . . , p (since it leaves the remainder 1 on division); so either N
is the required prime itself or it is composite-in which case it is divisible by a
prime larger than p. Either way, there would have to be a prime larger than p,
which contradicts the initial assumption that p is the largest prime. Hence
there is no largest prime.
   The argument, being a reductio ad absurdum, does not merely show that a
particular prime p can be defeated by finding a larger one; it shows that there
cannot be any largest prime at all. Likewise, the Godel-Turing argument
above does not merely show that a particular algorithm A can be defeated, it
shows that there cannot be any (knowably sound) algorithm at all that is
equivalent to the insights that we use to ascertain that certain computations do
not stop.

Q6. A computer could be programmed to follow through precisely the argument
that I have given here. Could it not itself, therefore, arrive at any conclusion that
I have myself reached?

   It is certainly true that it is a computational process to find the particular
calculation Ck(k), given the algorithm A. In fact this can be exhibited quite
explicitly. * Does this mean that the supposedly non-algorithmic mathe­
matical insight-the insight that allowed us to appreciate the fact that Ck(k)
never stops-is actually algorithmic after all?
   I think that it is important to address this discussion at some length, since it
represents one of the commonest misconceptions in relation to the Godel
argument. It should be made clear that it does not invalidate anything that has
gone before. Although the procedure for obtaining Ck(k) from A can be put
into the form of a computation, this computation is not part of the procedures
contained in A . It cannot be, because A is not capable of ascertaining the truth
of Ck(k), whereas this new computation (together with A) is asserted to be able
to. Thus, although the new computation is indeed a computation leading to
Ck(k), it is not one that has been admitted to the club of 'official truth
ascertainers'.
   Let me put things another way. Imagine a computer-controlled robot that is
able to ascertain mathematical truths by means of the algorithmic procedures
contained in A . To make things more graphic, I shall use an anthropomorphic
terminology and say that the robot 'knows' the mathematical truths-here
non-stopping of computations-that it can derive by the use of A . However, if
A is all that our robot 'knows', then it will not 'know' that Ck(k) does not stop,
          *To emphasize that I appreciate this point, I refer the reader to Appendix A,
       where an explicit computational procedure is exhibited (using the rules given in
       detail in ENM, Chapter 2) for obtaining the Turing machine action Ck(k) from the
       algorithm A. Here, A is assumed to be given to us in the form of a Turing machine
       T.,, whose assessment of c.(n) is coded as the action of T. on q followed by n.
82                              The Godelian case

even though the procedure for obtaining Ck(k) from A is perfectly algorithmic.
Of course, we could tell our robot that Ck(k) indeed does not stop (using our
own insights to that effect), but if the robot were to accept this fact, it would
have to modify its own rules by adjoining this new truth to the ones that it
already 'knows'. We could imagine going further than this and tell our robot,
in some appropriate way, that the general computational procedure for
obtaining Ck(k) from A is also something that it should 'know' as a way of
obtaining new truths from old. Anything that is well defined and computation­
al could be added to the robot's store of 'knowledge'. But we now have a new
'A', and the GOdel argument would apply to this, instead of to the old A. That
is to say, we should have been using this new 'A' all along instead of the old A ,
since i t i s cheating t o change our 'A' i n the middle of the argument. Thus, we
see that one thing that is wrong with Q6 is very similar to what is wrong with
Q5, as discussed above. In the reductio ad absurdum we assume that A-which
is to be a known, sound procedure for ascertaining that computations do not
stop-actually represents the totality of such procedures available to
mathematicians, and from this we derive a contradiction. It is cheating to
introduce another truth-judging computational procedure not contained in A,
after we have settled on A as representing this totality.
   The troubie for our poor robot is that in the absence of any understanding of
the Godel procedure the robot has no reliable independent way of judging
truth, other than being told by . us. (This is a separate matter from the
computational aspects of the Godel argument.) To be able to do more than
this, it, like us, would need to understand the meanings of the operations that it
has been told to perform. Without understanding, it could equally well
(wrongly) 'know' that Ck(k) does stop instead of that it does not. It is just as
much an algorithmic matter to derive (wrongly) that 'Ck(k) stops' as it is to
derive (correctly) that 'Ck(k) does not stop'. Thus the algorithmic nature of
these operations is not the point; the point is that our robot requires valid truth
judgements in order to know which algorithms give it truths and not
falsehoods. Now, at this point in the argument, it is still possible that
'understanding' is another kind of algorithmic activity, not contained in any
precisely given known-to-be-sound procedures such as A. For example,
understanding might be given by an unsound or unknowable algorithm. In my
later discussion (Chapter 3) I shall try to persuade the reader that in fact
 understanding is not an algorithmic activity at all. But, for now, we are just
concerned with rigorous implications of the GOdel-Turing argument, and, for
 this, the fact that Ck(k) can be obtained from A in a computational way is
neither here nor there.

Q7. The total output of all the mathematicians who have ever lived, together
with the output of all the human mathematicians of the next (say) thousand years
is finite and could be contained in the memory banks of an appropriate computer.
Surely this particular computer could, therefore, simulate this output and thus
                                The G6delian case                              83

behave (externally) in the same way as a human mathematician-whatever the
Godel argument might appear to tell us to the contrary?
   While this is presumably true, it ignores the essential issue, which is how we
(or computers) know which mathematical statements are true and which are
false. (In any case, the mere storage of mathematical statements is something
that could be achieved by a system much less sophisticated than a general­
purpose computer, e.g. photographically.) The way that the computer is being
employed in Q7 totally ignores the critical issue of truth judgement. One could
equally well envisage computers that contain nothing but lists of totally false
mathematical 'theorems', or lists containing random jumbles of truths and
falsehoods. How are we to tell which computer to trust? The arguments that I
am trying to make here do not say that an effective simulation of the output of
conscious human activity (here mathematics) is impossible, since purely by
chance the computer might 'happen' to get it right-even without any
understanding whatsoever. But the odds against this are absurdly enormous,
and the issues that are being addressed here, namely how one decides which
mathematical statements are true and which are false, are not even being
touched by Q7.
   There is, on the other hand, a more serious point that is indeed being
touched upon in Q7. This is the question as to whether discussions about
infinite structures (e.g. all natural numbers or all computations) are really
relevant to our considerations here, when the outputs of humans and
computers are finite. Let us consider this important issue separately next.
Q8. Non-terminating computations are idealized mathematical constructions
which have to do with the infinite. Surely such matters are not really relevant to
discussions about finite physical objects such as computers or brains?

   It is certainly true that with our idealized discussions of Turing machines,
non-terminating computations, etc., we have been considering (potentially)
infinite processes, whereas with humans or computers, we are dealing with
finite systems. It is important to try to assess the limitations of such idealized
 arguments when applying them to actual finite physical objects. However, it
 turns out that the consideration of finiteness does not substantially affect the
 actual Godel-Turing argument. There is nothing wrong with discussing
idealized computations, reasoning about them, and deriving, mathematically,
their theoretical limitations. We can, for example, in perfectly finite terms,
discuss the question as to whether or not there is an odd number that is the
sum of two even numbers, or whether there is any natural number that is not
the sum of four squares (as in (C) and (B) above), despite the fact that in
addressing these issues we are implicitly considering the infinite collection of
all natural numbers. We can perfectly well reason about non-terminating
computations, or Turing machines generally, as mathematical constructs even
though it would not be possible actually to build an endlessly operating
84                               The Godelian case

Turing machine in practice. (Note that, in particular, a Turing-machine action
that seeks an odd number that is the sum of two even numbers could not,
strictly speaking, be implemented physically; for its parts would wear out
rather than it really running on for ever.) The specification of any single
computation (or Turing-machine action) is a perfectly finite matter, and the
question as to whether or not it eventually stops is perfectly well defined. Once
we have finished with our reasoning about such idealized computations, we
can then try to see in what way our discussion applies to finite systems like
actual computers or to people.
   Finiteness limitations might come about either (i) because the specification
of the actual computation under consideration is inordinately enormous (i.e.
that the number n in Cn , or the pair of numbers q, n taken together in Cq (n), is
too large to be specified by a feasible computer or by a person), or (ii) because a
computation that is not too large to specify might nevertheless take too long to
perform, so that it might seem that it never stops even though, theoretically,
the specified computation eventually would stop. In fact it turns out, as we
shall see in a moment, that of these two it is only (i) that significantly affects our
discussion, and even (i) does not affect things very greatly. The unimportance
of (ii) is perhaps surprising. There are many fairly simple computations that
ultimately stop, but for which no conceivable computer could directly
compute far enough to reach the stopping point. For an example, consider the
following: 'print out a succession of 2 2 65 536 ls and then stop'. (Some much
more mathematically interesting examples will be given later in §3.26.) The
question as to whether or not a computation is going to stop need not be
settled by direct computation; often that is an extremely inefficient method.
   To see how the finiteness limitations (i) or (ii) might affect our Godel-type
discussion, let us re-examine the relevant parts of the argument. In accordance
with limitation (i), instead of having an infinite list of computations, we have a
finite list:
                        C0, C 1 , C2 , C3 , , CQ ,
                                               •   .   •




where we suppose that the number Q specifies the largest computation that
our computer, or human, is able to accommodate. In the case of a human, we
may consider that there is a certain vagueness about this. For the moment it is
not important that Q be defined as a precise number. (This question of such
vagueness, in relation to human capabilities, will be discussed later in the
response to Q13 in §2. 10.) Moreover, we suppose that when we apply these
computations to a particular natural number n, the value of n may be
restricted to being no larger than some fixed number N, because our computer
(or human) is not set up to handle numbers larger than N. (Strictly speaking,
we ought to consider the possibility that N is not a fixed number, but depends
upon the particular computation Cq that we are considering-i.e. N could
depend on q. This does not make any substantial difference to our
considerations, however.)
                                  The Giidelian case                            85

   As before, we consider a sound algorithm A (q , n) which, when it stops,
provides us with a demonstration that the computation Cq (n ) does not
terminate. When we say 'sound', although in accordance with (i) we need only
consider values of q that are no larger than Q and values of n that are no larger
than N, we really mean that A is to be sound for all values of q and n, no matter
how big they may be. (Thus, the rules embodied in A are precise mathematical
rules, and not approximate ones that work only by virtue of some practical
limitation on computations that can 'actually' be performed.) Moreover, when
we say that ' Cq (n ) does not terminate' we mean that it really does not terminate
and not that the computation might simply be too long to perform by our
computer or human, as is envisaged in (ii).
   Recall that (H) tells us:
If A (q , n) stops, then Cq (n ) does not stop.
In view of (ii), we might consider that the algorithm A is not much use to us for
deciding whether another computation fails to stop if, itself, it takes more steps
than our computer or human can possibly handle. But it turns out that this is
of no importance for the argument. We are going to find a computation A (k, k)
that does not stop at all. It does not matter to us that in some other cases, in
which A actually does stop, we are unable to wait long enough to find out that
it does.
   Now, as in (J), we locate a natural number k for which the computation
A(n, n) is the same as Ck(n) for each n:


However, we must now consider the possibility that this k is larger than Q, as
envisaged by (i). For a horrendously complicated A, this might indeed be the
case, but only if A were already beginning to approach the upper limit of size
(in terms of the number of binary digits in its Turing-machine specification)
that can be handled by our computer or human. This is because the
computation that obtains the value k from the (say, Turing-machine)
specification of A is quite a simple thing that can be given explicitly (as has
already been pointed out in the response to Q6 above).
   The actual computation that we need in order to defeat A is Ck(k), and
putting n = k in (H), we obtain (L):
If A (k , k) stops, then Ck(k) does not stop.
 Since A (k , k) is the same as Cik), our argument shows that the particular
 computation Ck(k) cannot stop at all, but that A cannot ascertain this fact,
even if it were allowed to run on for far longer than any limit imposed in
·accordance with (ii). The specification of Ck(k) is given in terms of the above k,
 and provided that k is not larger than either Q or N, it is a computation that
 could actually be implemented by our computer or human-in the sense that
86                              The Godelian case

the computation could start. It could not, in any case, be continued to
completion because the computation in fact does not ever stop!
    Now, might k really be larger than Q or N? This would only be the case if the
specification of A requires so many digits that increasing this number by
moderately little would lead to an overflow of our computer's or human's
capacity. It still follows from a knowledge of A's soundness that we know that
this Ck (k ) cannot stop, even though we might have difficulty in implementing
the actual computation Cik ). Consideration (i) does, however, lead us to
envisage the possibility that the computation A might be so stupendously
complicated that its specification puts it close to the borderline of
computations that it is possible for a human being to contemplate at all, and
the comparatively small increase in the number of digits that is being
considered will yield a computation that is beyond human contemplation. I
think that, whatever we may think of such a possibility, any such stupendous
set of computational rules embodied in this putative A would certainly be so
horrendously complicated that its soundness could not plausibly be known to
us even if the precise rules themselves could be known to us. Thus, our
conclusion stands, just as before: we do not ascertain mathematical truth by
means of a knowably sound set of algorithmic rules.
    It is of some value to be a little more specific about the comparatively mild
increase in complication that is involved passing from A to Ck (k ). This will
have a particular significance for us later (in §3.19 and §3.20). In Appendix A
(p. 1 17), an explicit specification for Ck (k ) is provided, in terms of the
Turing-machine prescriptions given in ENM, Chapter 2. According to these
prescriptions, Tm denotes the 'mth Turing machine'. To be specific here, it will
be convenient to use this notation rather than 'Cm' • particularly in order to
define the degree of complication of a computational procedure or of an
individual computation. Accordingly, I define this degree of complication J.l of
the Turing machine Tm to be the number of binary digits in the specification of
m as a binary number (cf. ENM, p. 39); then the degree of complication of
some particular computation Tm (n ) is defined as the larger of the two numbers
J.l and v, where v is the number of binary digits in the specification of n. Now
consider the explicit prescription, provided in Appendix A, for obtaining the
computation Ck (k ) from A, given in these Turing-machine terms. Taking the
degree of complication of A to be a, we then find that the degree of
complication of this explicit computation Ck (k ) turns out to be less than
a + 210 log 2 (a + 336), a number that is larger than a by only a relatively tiny
amount, when a is very large.
    There is a possible proviso to the above general line of argument that may
worry some readers. Does it really make sense to consider a computation that
may be too complicated to write down, or that if it were written down might
 take far far longer than the age of the universe actually to perform, even if each
 step could be performed in the tiniest fraction of a second, in which physical
 processes can sensibly be envisaged as taking place? The computation

considered above-which outputs a succession of 2265 5 3 6 1s, stopping only
after this task is completed-is such an example, and it would be an extremely
unconventional mathematical standpoint that allows us to claim that this is a
non-terminating computation. However, there are some mathematical
viewpoints, not so unconventional as to forbid this-though still decidedly
unconventional-according to which there might be some doubt introduced
about matters of absolute mathematical truth of idealized mathematical
statements. We should at least have a look at some of these.

Q9. The standpoint known as intuitionism forbids one from deducing that a
computation must terminate at a definite point merely from the fact that its
continuing indefinitely leads to a contradiction; likewise there are other
'constructivist' or 'finitist' points ot view. According to these might the GOdel­
type reasoning not be found questionable?

   In the Godel-type reasoning that I have given, I used, in (M), an argument
of the form: 'the assumption that X is false leads us to a contradiction;
therefore X is true'. Here 'X' is the statement 'Ck(k) does not stop'. This is a
reductio ad absurdum type of argument-and, indeed, the Goedelian argument
as a whole is phrased in this way. The mathematical standpoint known as
'intuitionism' (initiated by the Dutch mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer in
around 1912; cf. Kleelle 1952, also ENM pp. 1 13-16) denies that one can
validly reason by use of reductio ad absurdum. Intuitionism arose as a reaction
against certain mathematical trends that had arisen in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries according to which a mathematical object could be
asserted to 'exist' even though there might be no way given of actually
constructing the object in question. Sometimes a too free use of a nebulous
concept of mathematical existence would actually lead to a contradiction. The
most famous example of this occurs with Bertrand Russell's paradoxical 'set of
all sets that are not members of themselves'. (If Russell's set is a member of
itself, then it is not; if it is not, then it is! See §3.4 and ENM, p. 101, for further
details.) To counter this general trend, whereby very freely defined mathe­
matical objects could be taken to 'exist', the intuitionistic standpoint denied
that one can validly use the type of mathematical reasoning that allows one to
deduce the existence of some mathematical object merely from the contradict­
ory nature of its non-existence. Such a reductio ad absurdum argument does
not provide an actual construction for the object in question.
   How would a denial of this use of reductio ad absurdum affect our Godel­
type argument? In fact, not at all, simply because we are using reductio ad
absurdum in the opposite way from this, namely that the contradiction is being
derived from the assumption that something exists, not from the assumption
that something does not exist. According to intuitionism, it is perfectly
legitimate to deduce that something does not exist from the fact that a
contradiction arises from the assumption that it does exist. The Godel-type
88                                    The Godelian case

argument, as I have given it, is, in effect, perfectly intuitionistically acceptable.
(See Kleene 1952, p. 492.)
   Similar remarks apply to all the other 'constructivist' or 'finitistic'
viewpoints of which I am aware. The discussion following Q8 shows that even
the viewpoint hinted at above, which denies that the natural numbers can
'really' be considered to continue indefinitely, does not provide us with a way
to evade the conclusion that we do not use a knowably sound algorithm to
ascertain mathematical truth.

       2 . 7 Some deeper mathematical considerations
To gain more insights into the implications of Godel's argument, it will be
helpful to return to what was his original purpose. At the turn of the century
severe difficulties had begun to confront those who were concerned with the
foundations of mathematics. In the late 1 800s-to a large extent due to the
profoundly original contributions of the mathematician Georg Cantor (whose
'diagonal slash' we have encountered earlier)-mathematicians had found
powerful ways of establishing some of their deeper results, basing their
arguments upon the properties of infinite sets. However, fundamental
difficulties had also arisen in conjunction with such benefits, when too free a
use of the infinite-set concept was made. In particular, there was the Russell
paradox (that I briefly referred to above in response to Q9, cf. also §3.4-and
which had also been noted by Cantor), which pointed out some of the
obstacles to reasoning about infinite sets in too cavalier a way. Nevertheless,
provided that one was sufficiently careful about the kind of reasoning that was
to be allowed, it became clear that powerful mathematical results could indeed
be obtained. The problem seemed to be how to be absolutely precise about
what it means to be 'sufficiently careful' about one's reasoning.
   The great mathematician David Hilbert was one of the prime figures in a
movement aimed at securing this precision. This movement was referred to as
formalism, according to which all the allowed forms of mathematical reasoning
within some specified area, including any needed reasoning about infinite sets,
were to be laid down o�ce and for all. Such a system of rules and mathematical
statements is referred to as aformal system. Once the rules of a formal system IF
 have been determined, it is merely a matter of mechanical checking to see
whether or not the rules-necessarily finite * in number-have been correctly
applied. Of course, the rules would have to be regarded as valid forms of
         *Some formal systems are presented as having infinitely many axioms­
      described in terms of structures known as 'axiom schemata'-but to qualify as a
      'formal system' in the sense that I mean it here, such a formal system would have to
      be expressible in finite terms, the infinite axiom system being generated by a finite
      set of computational rules. It is indeed the case that this is possible for the standard
      formal systems that are used in mathematical proofs-such as the familiar
      'Zermelo-Fraenkel' formal system ZIF that describes conventional set theory.
                                        The Godelian case                                          89

mathematical reasoning, so that any result that could be deduced using them
could be trusted as being actually true. However, some of these rules might be
concerned with the manipulation of infinite sets, and here one's mathematical
intuitions as to which forms of reasoning are legitimate and which are not
might not be absolutely trustworthy. Doubts, in this connection, might indeed
seem to be appropriate in view of the inconsistencies that arise if one is allowed
such free use of infinite sets that even Bertrand Russell's paradoxical 'set of all
sets that are not members of themselves' would be permitted. The rules of IF
must fall short of allowing Russell's 'set', but how far short? To forbid the use
of infinite sets altogether would be much too limiting (for example, ordinary
Euclidean space contains an infinite set of points, and even the set of natural
numbers is an infinite set); moreover, it was clear that there are, indeed,
various particular formal systems which are perfectly satisfactory (not
allowing, for example, Russell's 'set' to be formulated) and by whose use most
of the needed mathematical results can be obtained. How can one tell which of
these formal systems are to be trusted and which are not?
     Let us fix attention on one such formal system IF, and use the notation lf !R OJ IE
and IFIU§IE, respectively, to denote mathematical statements which can be
obtained by means of IF's rules and those whose negations (i.e. 'not' the
statement in question) can be so obtained. Any statement that can be
formulated within IF but which is neither lf !R OJ IE nor IFM§IE in this sense would be
OJ N [) IEC m A i n iE . Some people would adopt the point of view that since infinite

sets themselves might really be 'meaningless', there may be no absolute sense
of truth or falsity with regard to them. (At least this might apply to some kinds
of infinite set if not to all of them.) According to this point of view, it might not
really matter which statements about (certain) infinite sets come out as being
lf JR OJ IE and which as IF A D._ § IE , provided that no statement comes out as being both

lf!ROJIE and IFAD._§ IE together-which is to say that the system IF is to be consistent.

For such people-the true formalists-the only questions of overriding
importance for a formal system IF would be (a) whether or not it is consistent
and, additionally, (b) whether or not it is complete. The system IF is called
complete if every mathematical statement that is properly formulated within IF
always turns out to be either lf i'! OJ IE or IFAD._§IE (so that IF contains no OJ N [) IEC m A II UIE
statements).
     The question as to whether or not a statement about infinite sets is actually
true in any absolute sense is, to a strict formalist, not necessarily meaningful
and certainly not considered to be relevant to the procedures of formalist
mathematics. Thus, in place of the quest for absolute mathematical truth for
statements about such infinite quantities, would be a desire for the
demonstration of consistency and completeness of suitable formal systems.
What kind of mathematical rules would be allowed for such a demonstration?
These rules themselves would have to be trustworthy, and they should not
make use of any dubious reasoning with loosely defined infinite sets (such as
Russell's). It was hoped that there might be logical procedures available within
90                               The Godelian case

certain comparatively simple and obviously sound formal systems (such as the
relatively elementary one known as Peano arithmetic) that would be sufficient
to prove the consistency of other, more sophisticated, formal systems-say
IF-that might allow formal reasoning about very 'large' infinite sets, and
whose consistency might not be at all self-evident. If one accepts the formalist
philosophy, then such a consistency proof for IF would at least provide a
justification for using the means of reasoning allowed by IF. Then proofs of
mathematical theorems might be given using infinite sets in a consistent way,
and the question as to the actual 'meanings' of such sets could perhaps be
dispensed with. Moreover, if such an IF could be shown also to be complete,
then one might reasonably embrace the viewpoint that IF actually encapsulates
all the mathematical procedures that are allowed; so, in a sense, IF could then
be considered actually to be the complete formulation of the mathematics of
the area in question.
    However, in 1930 (published in 193 1 }, GOdel produced his bombshell,
which eventually showed that the formalists' dream was unattainable! He
demonstrated that there could be no formal system IF, whatever, that is both
consistent (in a certain 'strong' sense that I shall describe in the next section)
and complete-so long as IF is taken to be powerful enough to contain a
formulation of the statements of ordinary arithmetic together with standard
logic. Thus, Godel's theorem would apply to systems IF for which arithmetical
statements such as Lagrange's theorem and Goldbach's conjecture, as
described in §2.3, could be formulated as mathematical statements.
    In the discussions to follow, I shall be concerned only with formal systems
that are sufficiently extensive that the necessary arithmetical operations for the
actual formulation of Godel's theorem can be contained within it (and, if
necessary, that the operations of any Turing machine can be contained within
 it; see below). When I refer to some formal system IF, it will normally be
assumed that IF is indeed sufficiently extensive for this. This will not restrict the
discussion in any essential way. (Nevertheless, for clarity, I shall sometimes
add the words 'sufficiently extensive', or some such, when discussing formal
 systems in such a context.)


              2.8 The condition of m-consistency
The most familiar form of Godel's theorem asserts, for a sufficiently extensive
formal system IF, that IF cannot be both complete and consistent. This is not
quite the famous 'incompleteness theorem' that he originally announced at the
meeting at Konigsberg, referred to in §2. 1 and §2.7, but is a slightly stronger
version that was subsequently obtained by the American logician J. Barkley
Rosser (1936). The version that Godel originally announced was equivalent to
showing that IF could not be both complete and w-consistent. The condition of
w-consistency is a bit stronger than that of ordinary consistency. To state what
                                 The Godelian case                              91

it means, we need a little notation. As part of the notation of a formal system IF,
there would be certain symbols denoting logical operations. There would be a
symbol denoting negation, i.e. 'not', and this might be denoted by ' "' '. Thus, if
 Q is a proposition, statable within IF, then the symbols "' Q denote 'not Q'.
There should also be a symbol that says 'for all [natural numbers]', called the
universal quantifier, and this might be denoted by 'V'. If P(n ) is a proposition
that depends upon the natural number n (so P is what is called a propositional
function), then the string of symbols Vn [P(n )] denotes the statement 'for all
natural numbers n, P(n ) holds true'. A particular example of such a P(n ) would
be: 'n is expressible as the sum of three squares', and then Vn [P(n )] stands for:
'every natural number is the sum of three squares'-which, in this case, would
be false (although it would be true if 'three' were replaced by 'four'). We can
combine such symbols in many ways; in particular, the string of symbols
                                    "' Vn [P(n )]
expresses the denial that P(n ) holds for all natural numbers n.
  What the condition of w-consistency asserts is that if "' Vn[P(n)] is provable
by the methods of IF, then it must not be the case that all of the statements
                        P(O), P(l ), P(2), P(3), P(4), . . .
are provable within IF. From this, it follows that if IF were not w-consistent, we
should have the anomalous situation in which, for some P, every one of P(O),
P(l ), P(2), P(3), . . . could be proved; yet the statement claiming to assert that
not all of these hold true is also provable! Certainly no trustworthy formal
system could admit this kind of thing. If IF is sound, then it is certainly
w-consistent.
   In this book I shall use the notation 'Q(IF)' for the assertion: 'the formal
system IF is w-consistent'. In fact (assuming that IF is sufficiently extensive),
Q(IF) is a sentence that can itself be formulated in terms of the operations of IF.
Godel's famous incompleteness theorem tells us that O(IF) is not a theorem of IF
(i.e. not provable using the procedures allowed by IF), provided that IF is
actually w-consistent! Correspondingly, I shall use the notation 'G(IF)' for the
assertion: 'the formal system IF is consistent' (also formulable within IF). The
somewhat stronger version of Godel's theorem that was later obtained by
Rosser tells us that if IF is consistent then G(IF) is not a theorem of IF. In the
remainder of this chapter, I shall tend to formulate my arguments in terms of
the more familiar G(IF), rather than O(IF), although for most of the discussion
either would do equally well. (For the more explicit arguments of Chapter 3, it
will sometimes be more appropriate to phrase things in terms of Q(IF),
however.)
   I shall not bother to draw a clear line between consistency and
w-consistency in most of my discussions here, but the version of the Godel
theorem that I have actually presented in §2.5 is essentially the one that asserts
92                               The Godelian case

that if IF is w-consistent, then it cannot be complete, being unable to assert Q(IF)
as a theorem. I shall not attempt to show this here (but see Kleene 1952). In
fact, for this form of Godel's argument to be reducible to the argument as I
have given it, a little more is needed for IF than merely that it 'contains
arithmetic and ordinary logic'. What we need is that IF be broad enough that
the actions of any Turing machine are included. Thus, the statements that can
be correctly formulated using the symbols of the system IF must include the
statements of the form: 'such-and-such a Turing machine, when acting on the
natural number n, produces the natural number p' . In fact, it is a theorem (cf.
Kleene 1952, Chapters 1 1 and 13) that this turns out automatically to be the
case if IF includes, in addition to the ordinary operations of arithmetic, the
operation (called the .u-operation): 'find the smallest natural number with
such-and-such arithmetical property'. Recall that in our original example of a
computation, (A), our procedure indeed found the smallest number that is not
the sum of three squares. Computations, generally, must be allowed to do
things of this kind. Indeed it is this that also leads us into the possibility of
encountering computations that do not terminate, such as (B), where we
attempt to find the smallest number that is not the sum ofjour squares, but
there is no such number.



         2.9 Formal systems and algorithmic proof
In the Godel-Turing argument, as I have given it in §2.5, I referred merely to
'computations', and made no reference to 'formal systems'. But there is a very
close relation between the two concepts. It is one of the essential properties of a
formal system that there must indeed be an algorithmic (i.e. 'computational')
procedure F for checking whether or not the rules of IF have been correctly
applied. If a proposition is T IIW IE , according to the rules of IF, then our
computation F will ascertain this fact. (What F could do would be to run
through all possible successions of strings of symbols that belong to the
'alphabet' of the system IF and to come successfully to a halt when the desired
proposition P is encountered as the final string, all the steps of the succession
being allowable according to the rules of the system IF.)
   Conversely, if E is some given computational procedure, intended to
ascertain the truth of certain mathematical statements, then we can construct
a formal system IE, that effectively expresses, as T IIW IE , all those truths that are
obtainable by means of the procedure E. There is, however, a slight proviso in
that a formal system would· normally be expected to include the standard
logical operations, whereas the given procedure E might not be extensive
enough to incorporate these directly. If our given E does not itself incorporate
these elementary logical operations, then it would be appropriate to adjoin
these logical operations to E in the construction of IE, so that the T IR IU IE
                                  The Gode/ian case                                 93

propositions of IE would be not only the statements that are obtainable directly
by the procedure E, but also those which are elementary logical consequences
of statements directly obtainable by means of E. In these circumstances, IE
would not be strictly equivalent to E, but would be somewhat more powerful.
   (These logical operations are just things like: 'if P&Q then P'; 'if P and P=Q
then Q'; 'if \fx[P(x)], then P(n)'; 'if ,.., \fx[P(x)] , then 3x[ "" P(x)]'; etc. Here,
the symbols '&', '=', '\f', '3', ' ,.., ' have the respective interpretations 'and',
'implies', 'for all [natural numbers]', 'there exists [a natural number]', 'not',
and there could be a few other such symbols.)
   To construct IE from E, we can start from some very basic (and obviously
consistent) formal system IL, expressing merely these primitive rules of logical
inference-such as the system known as predicate calculus (Kleene 1 952),
which does just this-and construct IE by adjoining E to IL in the form of
additional axioms and rules of procedure for IL, thereby deeming any
proposition P to be T IR IU IE whenever the procedure E obtains it. This need not be
easy to do in practice, however. If E is simply a Turing-machine specification,
then we might have to adjoin all the necessary Turing-machine notation and
operations to IL, as part of its alphabet and rules of procedure, before we can
adjoin Eitselfas, in effect, an additional axiom. (See end of §2.8; for full details,
see Kleene 1952.)
   It is not really important for our purposes here that the system IE that we
construct in this way might contain T IR IU IE propositions other than those
directly obtainable by E (the primitive logical rules of IL themselves being not
necessarily represented as part of the given procedure E). We were concerned,
in §2.5, with a putative algorithm A that purports to encapsulate all the
(known or knowable) procedures available to mathematicians for ascertain­
ing that computations do not stop. Any such algorithm would certainly have
to incorporate, among other things, all the basic operations of simple logical
inference. In the discussions which follow, therefore, I shall assume that A does
indeed incorporate such things.
   For the purposes of my argument, therefore, algorithms (i.e. computational
processes) and formal systems are basically equivalent as procedures for
accessing mathematical truths. Thus, although the argument that I gave in
 §2.5 was stated in terms of computations only, that argument is also relevant
to general formal systems. Recall that the argument refers to a listing of all
computations (Turing-machine actions) Cq (n). For the argument to apply in
detail to a formal system IF, therefore, it is necessary that IF be broad enough to
incorporate the actions of all Turing machines. The algorithmic procedure A
for ascertaining that certain computations do not stop can now be
incorporated into the rules for IF, so that the computations whose non­
stopping character can be established as T IR IU IE using IF would be identical to all
those whose non-stopping character can be ascertained using A .
   How does Godel's original Konigsberg argument relate t o the one that I
presented in §2.5? I shall not give details here, but merely point out the
94                                The Godelian case

essential ingredients. My algorithmic procedure A plays the role of the formal
system IF in Godel's original theorem:
                          algorithm A - rules of IF.
The particular proposition 'Ck(k) does not stop', obtained in §2.5 which is
inaccessible by the procedure A, yet which one perceives to be true so long as
one believes A to be sound, plays the role of the proposition Q(IF} that Godel
presented at Konigsberg and which actually asserts that IF is w-consistent:
     statement Ck(k) does not stop       - assertion that IF is w-consistent.
This perhaps helps us to understand how a belief in the soundness of a
procedure, such as A, can lead us to another procedure lying beyond the scope
of the original procedure, yet whose soundness we must also believe in. For if
we believe that the procedures of some formal system IF are sound-i.e. that
they allow us to derive only actual mathematical truths and not falsehoods, so
that if a proposition P is derived as T IIUJ IE , then it must actually be true-then we
must also believe that IF is w-consistent. If 'nm tE' implies 'true' and ' IFA I_§IE'
implies 'false'-as would be the case for any sound formal system IF-then,
certainly:
           not all of P(O), P(l }, P(2), P(3), P(4), . . . can be nw iE if
            it is IFAI_§IE that P(n) holds for all natural numbers n;
which, after all, is precisely what w-consistency asserts.
  Not only does a belief in the soundness of IF entail a belief in its
w-consistency, but a belief in its consistency also. For if 'nwlE' implies 'true'
and 'IFAI_§[E' implies 'false', then, certainly:
                        no P can be both    H U J IE   and IF A I_ § IE ;
which is precisely what consistency asserts. In fact, for many systems, the
distinction between consistency and w-consistency disappears. For simplicity
in what follows in this chapter, I shall generally not bother to draw a
distinction between these two kinds of consistency, and I shall normally just
state things in terms of 'consistency' alone. What Godel and Rosser showed is
that the consistency of a (sufficiently extensive) formal system is something
that lies outside the power of the formal system itself to establish. Godel's
earlier (Konigsberg) theorem referred to w-consistency, but the later, more
familiar result referred to ordinary consistency.
   The thrust of Godel's argument for our purposes is that it shows us how to
go beyond any given set of computational rules that we believe to be sound,
and obtain a further rule, not contained in those rules, that we must believe to
be sound also, namely the rule asserting the consistency of the original rules.
The essential point, for our purposes, is:
                 belief in soundness implies belief in consistency.
                                 The Godelian case                                95

We have no right to use the rules of a formal system IF, and to believe that the
results that we derive from it are actually true, unless we also believe in the
consistency of that formal system. (For example, if IF were inconsistent, then
we could deduce, as lr iiW IE , the statement '1 = 2', which is certainly not true! )
Thus, if we believe that we are actually doing mathematics when we use some
formal system IF, then we must also be prepared to accept reasoning that goes
beyond the limitations of the system IF, whatever that system IF may be.


      2 . 1 0 Further possible technical objections to C§
Let us now continue to examine various mathematical objections that have
been voiced from time to time to the kind of use I have made of the
Godel-Turing argument. Many of these objections are closely related to one
another, but I think that it will be helpful to spell them out separately in any
case.
QlO. Is mathematical truth an absolute matter? We have already seen that there
are differing views as to the absolute truth of statements about infinite sets. Can
we trust arguments that depend upon havlng some va�ue concept of
'mathematical truth', as opposed, perhaps, to a clearly defined concept of formal
HILHIHI?
   In the case of a formal system IF that is concerned with general set theory, it
indeed might not always be clear that there is any absolute sense in which a
statement about the sets is either 'true' or 'false'-in which case the very
concept of'soundness' for a formal system like IF might be called into question.
A famous example that brings home this kind of issue is contained in a result
proved by Godel (1940) and Cohen (1966). They showed that the
mathematical assertions known as the axiom ofchoice and Cantor's continuum
hypothesis are independent of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory-a
standard formal system that I shall denote here by ZIF. (The axiom of choice
asserts that for any collection of non-empty sets, there exists another set which
contains precisely one element from each member of the collection. 1 Cantor's
continuum hypothesis asserts that the number of subsets of natural
numbers-which is the same as the number of real numbers-is the next
largest infinity after the number of the natural numbers themselves. 2 It is not
necessary for the reader to appreciate the meanings of these assertions here.
Nor is it necessary for me to go into the details of the axioms and rules of
procedure of ZIF.) Some mathematicians would maintain that ZIF encapsulates
all the mathematical reasoning that is needed in ordinary mathematics. Some
would even contend that an acceptable mathematical argument is precisely
one that could, in principle, be formulated and proved within ZIF. (See the
discussion under Q14, below, for an assessment of how the Godel argument
applies to such people.) These mathematicians would therefore claim that the
96                                   The Godelian case

mathematical statements that are, respectively, T R U E , IFAIL§E, and U N D IEC D D A IB IL IE
according to ZF, are precisely the statements that, in principle, can be
mathematically established as being true, mathematically established as being
false, and are mathematically undecidable. To such people, the axiom of
choice and the continuum hypothesis would be mathematically undecidable
(as, they claim, the Godel-Cohen result shows), and they might well argue that
the truth or falsity of these two mathematical assertions is a purely
conventional matter.
   Do such seeming uncertainties as to the absolute nature of mathematical
truth affect our deductions from the Godel-Turing argument? Not at all-for
we are concerned here with a class of mathematical problem of a much more
limited nature than those which, like the axiom of choice and the continuum
hypothesis, relate to non-constructively infinite sets. Our only concern here is
with statements of the form:

            'such-and-such a computation does not ever terminate'.

where the computations concerned can be precisely specified in terms of
Turing-machine actions. Such statements are known to logicians, technically
as, II 1 -sentences (or, more correctly, as II �-sentences). For any formal system
F, both O(F) and G( F ) are II csentences (see §2.8). There would seem to be
little reasonable doubt that the true/false nature of any II 1 -sentence is an
absolute matter, independent of what position one might choose to hold on
questions that relate to non-constructively infinite sets-as with the axiom of
choice and the continuum hypothesis. (On the other hand, as we shall see in a
moment, the kind of reasoning that one accepts as providing convincing
demonstrations of II 1 -sentences might indeed depend upon one's position with
regard to non-constructively infinite sets; cf. Qll below.) It seems clear that,
apart from the extreme position taken by some intuitionists (cf. response to
Q9), the only reasonable issue with regard to the absolute nature of the truth of
such statements might be that some terminating computations can take so
inordinately long that they might not conceivably be completed in practice,
say in the entire history of the universe; or perhaps that the computation itself
might take so many symbols to state that its specification (though finite) could
not ever be written down. These matters, however, were fully analysed in the
discussion relating to Q8 above, and we saw there that our essential
conclusion � was unaffected. Recall also that, in relation to the discussion
concerning Q9 above, the intuitionistic position does not evade the conclusion
� either.
    As a further point, the (very limited) concept of mathematical truth that I
need for the Godel-Turing argument is actually no less well defined than the
concepts ofT R u lE , IF AIL§ E, and U N D IEC ! D AIBD.JE, for any formal system F. Recall from
the above (§2.9) that there is an algorithm F that is equivalent to F. If F is
presented with a proposition P (statable in the language of F), then this
                                    The Godelian case                                    97

algorithm comes successfully to a halt precisely when P is provable according
to the rules of IF, i.e. when P is T R OJ E . Likewise, P is !FAlSIE precisely if F comes
successfully to a halt when presented with "" P; and P is OJ N D EC IIJI A IR U precisely
when neither of these computations terminates. The issue of whether a
mathematical statement P is T IR OJ IE , FALSIE, or U N [II EC m A IRliE is of precisely the
same character as that of the actual truth of the stopping or otherwise of
computations-i.e. of the falsity or truth of certain TI 1 -sentences-which is all
that is needed for our GOdel-Turing-type argument.

Ql l . There are certain TI1-sentences that can be proved using infinite-set
theory, but no proofs are known using standard 'finite' methods. Does this not
mean that the way in which mathematicians decide even such well-defined
questions may really be a subjective matter? Different mathematicians, holding
different beliefs with regard to set theory, might have inequivalent criteria for
assessing the mathematical truth of TI1-sentences.

   This could be a significant point with regard to my own deductions from the
GOdel(-Turing) argument, and I may perhaps have attached insufficient
weight to it in my brief discussion in ENM. Surprisingly, Qll is not an
objection that seems to have worried anyone other than myself-at least no
one else has brought it to my attention! Both here and in ENM (pp. 417, 418) I
have phrased the GOdel(-Turing) argument in terms of what 'mathematicians'
or 'the mathematical community' are able to ascertain by means of reason and
insight. The advantage of putting things in such terms, rather than in terms of
what a particular individual might be able to ascertain by use of his or her
reason or insight, is that it enables us to get away from certain objections that
are frequently made to the version of the Godel argument put forward by
Lucas (1961 ). Various people 3 have objected that, for example, 'Lucas himself
could not possibly know his own algorithm. (Some such people even made the
same type of objection to my own presentation4-seemingly oblivious of the
fact that I did not phrase my argument in this 'personal' way at all! ) The
advantage of referring to the reasoning and insights that are available to
'mathematicians' or 'the mathematical community' is that this enables us to
get away from the suggestion that different individuals might perceive
mathematical truth in different ways, each according to his or her unknowable
personal algorithm. It is much harder to accept that the shared understanding
of the mathematical community as a whole might be the result of some
unknowable algorithm than that the understanding of a particular individual
might be. The point that Qll raises is that this shared understanding might
not be so universal and impersonal as I have taken it to be.
   It is indeed true that there are statements of the kind referred to in Ql l . That
is, there are ll csentences whose only known proofs depend upon an
appropriate use of the theory of infinite sets. Such a TI 1 -sentence could arise
from an arithmetical coding of a statement like 'the axioms of IF are consistent'
98                              The Godelian case

where the formal system IF involves the manipulations of large infinite sets
whose very existence might be a controversial matter. A mathematician who
believes in the actual existence of some appropriately enormous non­
constructive set S will come to the conclusion that IF is in fact consistent, but
another mathematician who does not believe in S will have no such faith in the
consistency of IF. Thus, even restricting attention to the well-defined issue of
the stopping or otherwise of Turing-machine actions (i.e. to the falsity or truth
of IT 1 -sentences) does not allow us to ignore the issue of the subjectivity of
beliefs with regard to, say, the existence of some large non-constructively
infinite set S. If different mathematicians employ inequivalent 'personal
algorithms' for ascertaining the truth of certain IT 1 -sentences, then it may be
considered to be unfair of me to refer simply to 'mathematicians' or 'the
mathematical community'.
   I suppose that, strictly speaking, it may indeed be slightly unfair; and the
reader, if so inclined, may prefer to reinterpret I'§ as:

"§ * No individual mathematician ascertains mathematical truth solely by
means of an algorithm that he or she knows to be sound.

The arguments that I am giving will still apply, but I think thl:lt some of the
later ones will lose a good measure of their force when the case is presented in
this form. Moreover, with the version "§*, the argument gets guided in what I
believe to be an unhelpful direction, where one is concerned more with the
particular mechanisms that govern the actions of particular individuals than
with principles that underlie the actions of all of us. I am not so much
concerned, at this stage, with how individual mathematicians might differently
approach a mathematical problem, but more with what is universal about our
understandings and our mathematical perceptions.
   Let us try to see whether we are really forced into the version "§* . Are
mathematicians' judgements actually so subjective that they might disagree in
principle as to whether a particular ll csentence has, or has not, been
established as true? (Of course, the argument establishing the IT 1 -sentence
might simply be too long or complicated for one or the other mathematician to
follow-d. Q12 below-so they might certainly differ in practice. But that is
not what is at issue here. We are here concerned solely with matters of
principle.) In fact, mathematical demonstration is not as subjective as this
might seem to suggest. Despite the fact that different mathematicians might
profess to holding somewhat different viewpoints as to what they maintain to
be unassailably true concerning foundational issues, when it comes to
demonstrations or refutations of clearly defined specific il l-sentences, they
will not tend to disagree when it actually comes to the point. A particular
IT 1 -sentence that, in effect, asserts the consistency of some system IF would not
normally be regarded as acceptably demonstrated if all one had to go on was
the existence of some controversial infinite set S. A more acceptable
                                 The Godelian case                               99

formulation of what had actually been demonstrated might be: 'ifS exists, then
 IF is consistent, and in that case the given IT 1 -sentence is true'.
     Nevertheless, there could be exceptions to this, where one mathematician
could take the view that some non-constructively infinite set S 'obviously'
exists-or, at least, that the assumption of its existence can in no way lead us
into a contradiction-whereas another mathematician might have no such
faith in the matter. Sometimes, as regards such foundational issues,
mathematicians do seem to run into irresolvable disputes. In principle this
could lead to their being unable convincingly to communicate their
demonstrations, even with regard to Il 1 -sentences. Perhaps different mathe­
maticians do actually have inherently different perceptions as to the truth of
statements that relate to non-constructively infinite sets. It is certainly true
that they often profess to having such different perceptions. But I think that
such differences are basically similar to the differences in expectations that
different mathematicians might have with regard to the truth of ordinary
mathematical propositions. These expectations are merely provisional
opinions. So long as a convincing demonstration or refutation has not been
found, the mathematicians may disagree amongst themselves as to what they
expect, or guess is true, but the possession of such a demonstration by one of
the mathematicians would (in principle) enable the others also to become
convinced. With regard to foundational issues, such demonstrations are
indeed lacking. It might be the case that convincing demonstrations will never
be found. Perhaps they cannot be found because such demonstrations do not
exist, and it is simply the case that there are different equally valid viewpoints
with regard to these foundational issues.
    In relation to all this, however, one point should be emphasized when it
comes to Il 1 -sentences. The possibility that a mathematician might have an
erroneous viewpoint-by which I mean, here, a viewpoint that allows incorrect
conclusions to be drawn as to the validity of certain Il 1 -sentences-is not our
present concern. Conceivably, mathematicians might use factually wrong
'insights'-in particular, unsound algorithms-but this is not relevant to the
present section, since it would be in agreement with �. This possibility will be
addressed in full detail, instead, in §3.4. The issue here, therefore, is not
whether there can be inconsistent viewpoints among different mathematicians,
but rather that one viewpoint might in principle be more powerful than
another. Each viewpoint would be perfectly sound with regard to its
implications as to the truth of Il 1 -sentences, but some viewpoint might, in
principle, enable its supporters to ascertain that certain computations will not
terminate whereas this would not be so for the less powerful viewpoints. Thus,
different mathematicians might possess essentially different degrees of insight.
    I do not think that this possibility poses any significant threat to my original
formulation �. Although there may be different viewpoints with regard to
infinite sets that mathematicians car reasonably hold to, there are not that
many different ones-probably not more than about four or five. The only
100                            The Godelian case

differences of relevance would be things like the axiom of choice (referred to
under QlO), which many would regard as 'obvious' whilst others would refuse
to accept the non-constructiveness involved. Curiously, these differing
viewpoints with regard to the axiom of choice itself do not directly lead to a
Il csentence whose validity is in dispute. For, whether or not the axiom of
choice is regarded as 'true', this axiom does not lead to an inconsistency with
the standard ZIF axioms, as the Godel--Cohen theorem (referred to under QlO)
shows. There might, however, be other disputed axioms for which no
corresponding theorem is known. But usually, when it comes to the
acceptance, or otherwise, of some set-theoretic axiom--call it axiom Q-the
mathematician's statements would take the form: 'assuming axiom Q it
follows that . . .'. This would not be a matter of dispute between any of them.
The axiom of choice seems to be an exception in that it is frequently assumed
without mention, but it apparently poses no challenge to the general
impersonal formulation that I have given for C§, provided that we restrict
attention, in C§, to II 1 -sentences:
C§ ** Human mathematicians are not using a knowably sound algorithm in
order to ascertain the truth of II 1 -sentences,
which is all that we shall need in any case.
   Are there other disputed axioms-regarded as 'obvious' by some but
questioned by others? I think it would be a gross exaggeration to say that there
are as many as 10 essentially different viewpoints, involving set-theoretic
assumptions, that are not explicitly taken into account as assumptions. Let us
concede that there is some such small number, and examine the implications.
This would mean that there are conceivably as many as about 10 essentially
different grades of mathematician, graded with regard to the types of
reasoning, involving infinite sets, that they would be prepared to accept as
'obviously' valid. We could refer to them as n-grade mathematicians, where n
ranges over just a few values-no more than about 10. (The higher the grade,
the more powerful would be the mathematicians' viewpoint.) In place of C§ ** ,
we now have:
C§ *** for each n (where n can take just a few values), human n-grade
mathematicians do not ascertain the truth of II 1 -sentences solely by means of
an algorithm that they know to be sound.
This follows because the Godel(-Turing) argument can be applied for each
grade separately. (It should be made clear that the GOdel argument itself is not
a matter of dispute between mathematicians, so if the putative n-grade
algorithm were knowably sound to any n-grade mathematician, the argument
would provide a contradiction.) Thus, as with C§, it is not a question of there
being a great many unknowably sound algorithms, where each algorithm is
specific to each individual. Instead, what we have ruled out is the possibility
                                 The Godelian case                               101

that there might be just a very small number of inequivalent unknowably
sound algorithms, graded with respect to their strengths, which provide the
different 'schools of thought'. The version '§ *** will not differ significantly
from '§ or '§ ** in the discussions to follow, and for simplicity I shall not try to
make a distinction between them, referring, collectively, to '§.

Q12. Despite what mathematicians might or might not claim to have as their
various viewpoints, in principle, surely they would, in practice, differ very greatly
in their abilities to follow an argument? Surely they also differ very greatly in
those insights that allow them to make mathematical discoveries?

   Of course these things are true, but they are not really relevant to the point
at issue. I am not concerned with what specific detailed arguments a
mathematician might in practice be able to follow. Still less am I concerned
here with the issue of which arguments a mathematician might be able, in
practice, to discover, or with the insights and inspirations that may enable
them to make such discoveries. The question here concerns only what type of
arguments can in principle be perceived as valid by mathematicians.
   Now the qualification 'in principle', in the foregoing discussions, is used
advisedly. Assuming it to be the case that a mathematician is in possession of a
demonstration or refutation of some II 1 -sentence, disagreements by other
mathematicians as to the demonstration's validity can be resolved only if the
mathematicians have the time, patience, open-mindedness, and the ability and
determination to follow through, with understanding and accuracy, a possibly
long and subtle chain of reasoning. In practice, the mathematicians might well
give up before the issues are fully resolved. However, matters such as this are
not the concern ofthe present discussion. For there certainly does appear to be
a well-defined sense in which what is accessible in principle to one
mathematician is the same (considerations of Qll apart) as what is accessible
to another-or, indeed, to any other thinking person. The chain of reasoning
may be very long and the concepts involved may be subtle or obscure, but
there are nevertheless convincing enough reasons to believe that there is
nothing in one person's understanding that is in principle inaccessible to
another. This applies also in those cases where the aid of a computer may have
had to be called upon in order to follow through the full details of a purely
computational part of a proof. Although it might be beyond reasonableness to
expect a human mathematician to follow through the necessary details of the
computations involved in an argument, there is nevertheless no doubt that the
individual steps are things easily capable of comprehension and acceptance by
a human mathematician.
   In saying this, I am referring merely to the sheer complexity of a
mathematical argument and not to possible essential matters of principle that
might separate one mathematician from another with regard to what types of
reasoning that they are prepared to accept. I have certainly encountered
102                              The Godelian case

mathematicians who claim that there are mathematical arguments that they
have encountered which lie utterly beyond their competence: 'I know that I
shall never be able to understand such-and-such, or so-and-so, no matter how
long I try; the type of reasoning is totally beyond me.' In any individual
example of such a claim, one would have to decide whether it is really a case of
the reasoning lying in principle outside the mathematician's belief system-as
would be covered by the discussion under Qll-or whether the mathemat­
ician really could, if he or she tried hard enough for long enough, follow the
principles underlying the argument. Far more often than not, it is the latter. In
fact the most common situation is that it would be the obscure writing style, or
perhaps limitations of lecturing abilities, of 'so-and-so' that would be the
source of our mathematician's despairing, rather than anything of essential
principle in the 'such-and-such' that lies beyond his or her capabilities! A good
exposition of an apparently obscure topic can work wonders.
    To emphasize the kind of point I am making here, I should say, of myself,
that I frequently attend mathematical seminars where I do not follow (or do
not even attempt to follow) the details of the arguments that are being
presented. I may have the feeling that ifl went away and studied the arguments
at length then I ought indeed to be able to follow them-though probably only
with supplementary reading material or verbal explanations to fill in the
missing details in my own background and probably also in the seminar itself.
I know that in fact I shall not do this. Time, attention span, and sufficient
enthusiasm will almost certainly be lacking. Yet I may well accept the result as
presented in the seminar for all kinds of 'irrelevant' reasons, such as the fact
that the result 'looks' plausible, or that the lecturer has a reliable reputation, or
that other people in the audience whom I know to be much sharper than I am
in such matters have not questioned the result. Now, of course I might be
wrong in all this and the result is actually false, or perhaps it is true but does
not follow by the actual argument as given. These are detailed issues that are
not relevant to the point of principle that I am making here. The result might
be true and validly demonstrated, in which case in principle I could have
followed the argument-or else the argument is actually erroneous, which, as
mentioned earlier, is not a situation of concern to us here (cf. §3.2 and §3.4).
The only possible exceptions might be if the lecture concerned debatable
aspects of infinite-set theory, or if it depended upon some unusual type of
reasoning that might be questionable according to certain mathematical
viewpoints (which, in itself, might intrigue me sufficiently that I might actually
 go through the argument in question afterwards). These possible exceptional
 situations are just those covered in Qll above.
    In relation to such considerations of mathematical standpoint, in practice
 many particular mathematicians might indeed have no clear viewpoint as to
what foundational principles they actually adhere to. But, as commented
 above in relation to Ql l, a mathematician who has no clear view on whether
 or not to accept, say, 'axiom Q' would, if careful, always state results that
                                      The Godelian case                                        103

require Q in the form 'assuming axiom Q, it follows that . . . '. Of course
mathematicians, though a notoriously pedantic breed, are not always
impeccably careful about such matters. Indeed, it is also true that they even
make clear-cut mistakes from time to time. But these mistakes, if they are
basically slips and not matters of unalterable principle, are correctable. (As
mentioned before, the possibility that they actually use an unsound algorithm
as the ultimate basis of their decisions will be considered in detail in §3.2 and
§3.4. That possibility, being in accordance with '§, is not part of the present
discussion.) We are not really concerned with correctable mistakes here,
because they do not contribute to what cannot or can be achieved in principle.
The possible uncertainties of a mathematician's actual standpoint, however,
need further discussion, as follows.
Q13. Mathematicians do not have absolutely definite beliefs about the
soundness or consistency of the formal systems they use-or even about which
formal systems they might be considered as committing themselves to. Would
not their beliefs just shade off by degrees as the formal systems get further from
their immediate intuitions and experiences?
   Indeed, it is rare to find a mathematician whose opinions are rigid and
unshakafily consistent when it comes to the foundations of the subject.
Moreover, as mathematicians gain in experience, their viewpoints may well
shift with regard to what they take to be unassailably true-if they indeed ever
take anything to be unassailably true. Can one be utterly completely sure that 1
is different from 2, for example? If we are talking about absolute human
certainty, it is not really clear that there is such a thing. But one must take a
stand somewhere. A reasonable stand would be to take some body of beliefs
and principles as being unassailably true and to argue from there onwards. It
may be, of course, that many mathematicians would not even have a definite
opinion as to what they would take as unassailably true. In any such case, I
would ask them to take a stand, however, even if they might be prepared to
modify it later. What the GOdel argument shows is that whatever standpoint is
adopted, that standpoint cannot be (known to be) encapsulated in the rules of
any knowable formal system. It is not that the standpoint is being continually
modified; the body of beliefs that any (sufficiently extensive) formal system IF
encompasses must also extend beyond what IF can achieve. Any standpoint
that includes the soundness of IF among its unassailable beliefs must also
include a belief in the Godel proposition * G(IF). The belief in G(IF) does not
represent a change in standpoint; that belief is already implicitly contained in
the original standpoint which has admitted to accepting IF-even though the
realization of the fact that G(IF) must also be accepted may not have been
apparent at first.
        *See §2.8 for the notation used here. As we shall see at the end of this discussion,
      'Q(IF)' could have been used in place of G(IF) throughout.
104                              The Godelian case

    Of course there is always the possibility that some error may have crept in
with regard to one's deductions from the premises of any particular
standpoint. Even the mere possibility that one may have made such an error
somewhere-even when, in fact, one has not done so--may lead to a shading
off of the degree of confidence that one feels about the conclusions. But this
kind of 'shading off is not really our concern. Like actual errors, it is
'correctable'. Moreover, so long as an argument has indeed been correctly
carried out, then the longer it is examined the more convincing the resulting
conclusions should become. This kind of 'shading off is a matter of what a
mathematician might feel in practice, rather than in principle, and it leads us
back to the discussion of Ql2.
    Now, the issue here is whether there is a shading off in principle, so that a
mathematician might take the line that, say, the soundness of some formal
system IF is unassailable, whereas a more powerful system IF* might perhaps be
merely 'practically certainly' sound. I do not think that there is much question
but that whatever IF is taken to be, we may as well insist that it includes the
ordinary rules of logic and arithmetical operations. Our aforesaid mathemat­
ician, believing that IF is sound, must also believe that IF is consistent, and hence
that its Godel proposition G(IF) is true. Thus, deductions from IF alone cannot
represent the totality of the mathematician's mathematical beliefs, whatever IF
might be.
    But is G(IF) to be taken as unassailably true whenever IF is taken to be
unassailably sound? I think that there can be little doubt that this must be so;
and certainly so if we adhere to the 'in principle' viewpoint that we have been
adopting hitherto, as regards the following of a mathematical argument. The
only real question concerns the details of the actual coding of the assertion 'IF is
consistent' into an arithmetical statement (a ll 1 -sentence). The underlying
idea is itself surely unassailably clear: if IF is sound, then it is certainly
consistent. (For if it were not consistent, then among its assertions would be
 '1 = 2', so it would be unsound.) As regards the details of this coding, there is
again the distinction between the 'in principle' and 'in practice' levels. It is not
that hard to convince oneself that such a coding is in principle possible
 (though persuading oneself that there is indeed no 'catch' to the argument may
 take some time), but it is quite another matter to be convinced that any specific
actual coding has been correctly carried out. The details of the coding tend to
 be somewhat arbitrary, and they might differ greatly from one exposition to
 another. There might indeed be some minor error or misprint which would,
 technically speaking, invalidate the specific number-theoretic proposition that
 is intended to express 'G(IF)', but does not exactly do so.
    I hope it is clear to the reader that the possibility of such errors is not the
 point, when it comes to what is meant here by accepting G(IF) as being
 unassailably true. I mean, of course, the real G(IF), not the possibly unintended
 proposition that one may have inadvertently stated owing to a misprint or
 minor error. I am reminded of a story concerning the great American physicist
                                     The Godelian case                                      105

Richard Feynman. Apparently Feynman was explaining some idea to a
student, but mis-stated it. When the student expressed puzzlement, Feynman
replied: 'Don't listen to what I say; listen to what I mean!'*
   One possible explicit coding would be to use the Turing-machine
specifications that I gave in ENM and to follow through the exact Godel-type
argument that I have provided in §2.5 and have given an explicit coding for in
Appendix A. Even this would not yet be completely explicit, because we also
need the explicit coding of the rules of IF in terms of a Turing-machine action,
say Tf. (The property that Tf would have to satisfy would be that if some
proposition P, constructable in terms of the language of IF, is assigned the
number p, then we must arrange, say, that Tf(p) = 1 whenever P is a theorem of
IF, and Tf(p) does not stop otherwise.) Of course there is much scope for
technical error. Quite apart from possible difficulties involved in actually
constructing Tf from IF and p from P, there is the question as to whether I have
made a mistake myself in my own specifications for Turing machines-and
whether the code given in Appendix A of this book is correct or not, if it is
decided to use this particular specification, in order to calculate Ck(k). I do not
think that there is an error, but my trust in myself here is not so great as my
trust in GOdel's own original (if more complicated) specifications. But I hope
that it is clear, by now, that possible errors of this kind are not the point. We
must heed Feynman's dictum!
    With my own particular specifications, however, there is another technical
point that should be mentioned. In §2.5, I did not actually state my version of
the Godel(-Turing) argument in terms of the consistency of IF, but in terms of
the soundness of the algorithm A, as a test of the non-stopping character of
computations (i.e. of the truth of ll 1 -sentences). This will do just as well,
because we have seen that the soundness of A implies the truth of the
ll 1 -sentence Q(IF) (cf. §2.8) that asserts that Ck(k) does not stop, so we can use
Q(IF) in place of G(IF). Moreover, as remarked earlier (cf. §2.8), the argument
actually depends on the w-consistency of IF, not its consistency. The soundness
of IF clearly implies its w-consistency, just as well as its consistency. Neither
Q(IF) nor G(IF) follows from the rules of IF, assuming that IF is sound, but both
are true.
   To sum up, I think that it is clear that however much 'shading off' there may
be in a mathematician's beliefs in passing from a belief in the soundness of a
formal system IF to a belief in the truth of the proposition G(IF) (or Q(!F) ), this
will lie entirely in the possibility that there is some error in the precise
formulation of 'G(IF)' that has been provided. (The same applies to Q(IF).) This
is not really relevant to the present discussion, and there should be no shading
off in one's belief of the actually intended version of G(IF). If IF is unassailably

         *I have been unable to locate a specific source for this quotation. However, as
      was pointed out to me by Richard Jozsa, it does not matter if l have mis-stated it,
      since I can apply its underlying message to itself!
106                                  The Godelian case

sound, then this G(IF) is also unassailably true. The forms of<'§ (or "§ ** or "§ *** )
remain unaffected provided that 'truth' means 'unassailable truth'.

Ql4. Surely the system ZIF-or some standard modification of Z IF (call it
ZIF*)-really represents all that is needed for doing serious mathematics. Why
not just stick with this system, accept that its consistency is not provable, and just
get on with doing mathematics?

    I think that this kind of viewpoint is a very common one among working
mathematicians-especially those who do not concern themselves particu­
larly with the foundations or the philosophy of their subject. It is not an
unreasonable viewpoint for someone whose basic concern is, indeed, just
getting on with the serious business of doing mathematics (although such
people very rarely actually express their results within the strict rules of a
system such as ZIF). According to this viewpoint, one is concerned just with
what can be proved or disproved within a specific formal system such as Z IF (or
some modification, ZIF* ). From this point of view, the carrying out of
mathematics is really playing a kind of 'game'. Let us call this game the Z IF­
game (or ZIF * -game), where one has to play the game according to those
specific rules that have been laid down within the system. This is really the
point of view of the formalist, the strict concern of the formalist being what is
lrUUJIE and what is O:M§IE, and not necessarily what is true and what is false.
Assuming that the formal system is sound, then anything that is lri!UJIE will also
be true, and anything that is O:IU§IE will also be false. However, there will then
be some statements, formalizeable within the system, that are true but not
lriRIIJIE and some that are false but not Mll.§IE, those statements being, in each
case, IIJI'\J[]IIECmAIEIU. The Godel statement * G(ZIF) and its negation -- G(ZIF)
belong to these two respective categories, in the ZIF-game, assuming that ZIF is
consistent. (In fact if ZIF were inconsistent, then both G(ZIF) and its negation
 "' G(ZIF) would be lr!RIIJIE-and also O:Ail.§IE as well! )
     The ZIF-game i s probably a perfectly reasonable standpoint for carrying out
most of the things of interest in ordinary mathematics. However, for reasons
that I have indicated earlier, I do not see how it can represent a genuine
standpoint with regard to one's mathematical beliefs. For if one believes that
the mathematics that one is doing is deriving actual mathematical truths-of,
say, II 1 -sentences-then one must believe that the system that one is using is
sound; and if one believes that it is sound, then one must also believe that it is
consistent, so one must actually believe that the Il csentence that asserts G(IF)
is really true--despite the fact that it is IIJI'\J[]IIECmAIEIII.. IE . Thus one's mathematical
beliefs must go beyond what can be derived within the ZIF-game. If, on the
 other hand, one does not trust ZIF as being sound, then one cannot trust the
 lriRIIJIE results obtained using the ZIF-game as being actually true.
         *As before, Q(IF) will do just as well as G(IF). The same applies to Q1S--Q20.
                                   The Godelian case                                 107

Either way, the ZIF-game itself cannot represent a satisfactory standpoint with
regard to mathematical truth. (The same applies just as well to any ZIF * .)
Q15. The formal system IF that we choose to use might not actually be
consistent-at least, we may well not be sure that IF is consistent-in which case,
by what right can we assert that G(IF) is 'obviously' true?
   Although this issue has really been amply covered in the preceding
discussions, I think that it is worth while to reiterate the essential point here,
since arguments in the nature of Q15 represent among the commonest attacks
on the kind of use of the Godel theorem that Lucas and I have made. The point
is that we do not claim that G(IF) is necessarily true whatever IF might be, but
that we must conclude that G(IF} is just as reliable a truth as any that we obtain
using the rules of IF itself. (In fact, G{IF) is more reliable than statements that are
derived actually using the rules of IF because IF might be consistent without
actually being sound!) If we trust any statement P that we derive solely using
the rules of IF, then we must also trust G(IF) to at least such a degree as we trust
P. Thus, no knowable formal system IF--or its equivalent algorithm F-can
represent the total basis of our true mathematical knowledge or beliefs. As
stated in the commentaries on QS and Q6, the argument is given as a reductio
ad absurdum: we try to suppose that IF does represent the total basis of our
beliefs, and then show that this leads to a contradiction, so therefore it cannot
represent our basis for belief, after all.
   As in Q14, we may, of course, use some system IF as a convenience even
though we may be uncertain whether it is sound, and therefore consistent. But
if there is genuine doubt about IF, we must, in this case, state any result P
obtained by use of IF in the form
                              'P is deducible within IF'
('or P is H QJ IE' ) , rather than simply asserting that 'P is true'. This is a perfectly
good mathematical statement, which might be either actually true or actually
false. It would be perfectly legitimate to restrict one's mathematical
pronouncements to statements of this kind, but if so, one is still making
statements about absolute mathematical truths. On occasion, one might
believe that one has established that a statement of the above form is actually
false; i.e. one might believe that one has established
                           'P is not deducible within IF'.
Statements of this kind are of the form 'such-and-such a computation does not
terminate' (in fact: 'F applied to P does not terminate') which are precisely of
the form of the II 1 -sentences that I have been considering. The issue is: what
means does one allow in deriving statements of this kind? What, indeed, are
the mathematical procedures that one actually believes in for establishing
mathematical truths? Such a body of beliefs, if they are reasonable, cannot be
108                               The Godelian case

equivalent to a belief in a formal system, no matter what that formal system
might be.

Q16. The conclusion that G(IF) is actually true, of a consistent formal system IF,
depends upon the assumption that the symbols in IF which are supposed to
represent the natural numbers actually do represent natural numbers. For some
other exotic type of number§--(:all them the 'supernatural' numbers- we might
find that G(IF) is false. How do we know that we are referring to the natural and
not supernatural numbers in our system IF?

    It is true that there is no finite axiomatic way of making sure that the
'numbers' that we are referring to are actually the intended natural numbers
and not some kind of unintended 'supernatural' numbers. 5 But, in a sense, this
is the whole point of the Godel discussion. No matter what axiom system IF we
provide, as an attempt to characterize the natural numbers, the rules of IF
themselves will be insufficient to tell us whether G(IF) is actually true or false.
Supposing IF to be consistent, we know that the intended meaning of G(IF) is
something that is indeed true, not false. However, this depends on the symbols
that actually constitute the formal expression that is denoted by 'G(IF)' having
their intended meanings. If these symbols are reinterpreted as meaning
something quite different, then we can arrive at an interpretation for 'G(IF)'
that is indeed false.
    To see how these ambiguities come about, we consider new formal systems
IF * and IF ** , where IF * is obtained by adjoining G(IF) to the axioms of IF, and IF* *
i s obtained by correspondingly adjoining "" G(IF) instead. Provided that IF is
consistent, then IF* and IF** are both consistent also (since, respectively,
neither "" G(IF) nor G(IF) is deducible from the rules of IF). But with the intended
interpretation of the symbols of IF-called the standard interpretation-then,
assuming IF to be sound, IF * will be sound also, but IF ** will not be sound.
However, it is a feature of consistent formal systems that one can find so-called
non-standard reinterpretations of the symbols so that propositions that are
false using the standard interpretation turn out to be true in the non-standard
one; accordingly IF and IF ** could now be sound, in such a non-standard
interpretation, instead of IF* . One could imagine that this reinterpretation
might affect the meanings of the logical symbols (such as ' "" ' and '&', which in
the standard interpretation mean 'not' and 'and', respectively), but here we are
concerned with the symbols representing undetermined numbers ('x', 'y' , 'z' ,
'x", 'x'", etc.) and the meanings of the logical quantifiers (V, 3) used in
association with them. Whereas in the standard interpretation 'Vx' and '3x'
would mean, respectively, 'for all natural numbers x' and 'there exists a natural
number x such that', in such a non-standard interpretation the symbols would
refer not to natural numbers but to some different kind of numbers, with
different ordering properties (which could indeed be called 'supernatural'
 numbers, as in the terminology of Hofstadter (1979)).

   The fact is, however, that we actually know what the actual natural numbers
are, and ourselves have no problem about distinguishing them from some
strange kind of supernatural number. The natural numbers are the ordinary
things that we normally denote by the symbols 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . .. These are
the concepts that we become acquainted with as small children, and we have
no problem about distinguishing them from some bizarre concept of
supernatural number (cf. § 1 .21 ). There is perhaps something mysterious,
however, in the fact that we do seem to know instinctively what the natural
numbers actually are. For as children (or adults) we are provided with just a
comparatively small number of descriptions as to what 'zero', 'one', 'two',
'three', etc., mean ('three oranges', 'one banana', etc.); yet we can grasp the
entire concept despite this inadequacy. In some Platonic sense, the natural
numbers seem to be things that have an absolute conceptual existence
independent of ourselves. Notwithstanding such human independence, we are
able, intellectually, to make contact with the actual natural-number concept
from merely these vague and seemingly inadequate descriptions. On the other
hand, no finite number of axioms can completely distinguish natural numbers
from these alternative, so-called 'supernatural', possibilities.
   Moreover, the specific infinite character of the totality of natural numbers is
something that somehow we are able to perceive directly, whereas a system
that is constrained to operate by precise finite rules is not able to distinguish
the particular infinite character of the natural numbers from other ('super­
natural') possibilities. The infinitude that characterizes the natural numbers is
understood by us, even though merely represented by the dots ' . . .' in the
description
                              '0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . .'
                                                      .




or by the 'etc.' in
                          'zero, one, two, three, etc.'.
We do not have to be told exactly what a natural number is, in terms of precise
rules. This is fortunate, since it is not possible. Somehow, we find we know
what a natural number is, once we have been just roughly steered in the right
direction!
    Some readers may be familiar with the Peano axioms for the arithmetic of
natural numbers (alluded to briefly under §2.7), and be puzzled as to why they
do not define the natural numbers adequately. According to the Peano
definition, one starts with a symbol 0, and there is a 'successor operator',
denoted by S, which is interpreted as simply adding 1 to the number on which
it operates, so we can define 1 to be SO, and 2 to be Sl or SSO, etc. We have, as
rules, the fact that if Sa = Sb, then a = b; and that for no x is 0 of the form Sx,
where this particular property characterizes 0. Also there is the 'induction
principle' that states a property P, of numbers, must be true of all numbers n
1 10                              The Godelian case

provided that it satisfies: (i) if P(n) is true then P(Sn) is also true, for all n; (ii)
P(O) is true. The trouble comes with the logical operations where, in the
standard interpretation, the symbols V and 3 respectively denote 'for all
natural numbers . . .' and 'there exists a natural number . . . such that'. In a non­
standard interpretation, the meanings of these symbols would shift
appropriately, so that they would quantify, instead, over some other kind of
'number'. While it is true that the Peano mathematical specifications that are
given for the successor operator S do in fact characterize the ordering
relationships that distinguish the natural numbers from any kind of
'supernatural' numbers, those specifications are not captured in terms of the
formal rules that these quantifiers V and 3 satisfy. In order to capture the
meanings of the Peano mathematical specifications, we need to pass to what is
known as 'second-order logic' in which quantifiers like V and 3 are introduced
but where now their ranges are over (infinite) sets of natural numbers rather
than just single natural numbers. In the 'first-order logic' of Peano arithmetic,
the quantifiers would simply range over single numbers, and we get a formal
system in the ordinary sense. But second-order logic does not provide us with
a formal system. For a strict foimal system, it has to be a purely mechanical (i.e.
algorithmic) matter to decide whether or not the rules of the system have been
correctly applied, which, in any case, is the whole point of considering formal
systems in the present context. This property fails for second-order logic.
   It is a common misconception, in the spirit of the sentiments expressed in
Q16, that Godel's theorem shows that there are many different kinds of
arithmetic, each of which is equally valid. The particular arithmetic that we
may happen to choose to work with would, accordingly, be defined merely by
some arbitrarily chosen formal system. GOdel's theorem shows that none of
these formal systems, if consistent, can be complete; so--it is argued-we can
keep adjoining new axioms, according to our whim, and obtain all kinds of
alternative consistent systems within which we may choose to work. The
comparison is sometimes made with the situation that occurred with
Euclidean geometry. For some 21 centuries it was believed that Euclidean
geometry was the only geometry possible. But when, in the eighteenth century,
mathematicians such as Gauss, Lobachevsky, and Bolyai showed that indeed
there are alternatives that are equally possible, the matter of geometry was
 seemingly removed from the absolute to the arbitrary. Likewise, it is often
 argued, Godel showed that arithmetic, also, is a matter of arbitrary choice,
 any one set of consistent axioms being as good as any other.
   This, however, is a completely misleading interpretation of what Godel has
 demonstrated for us. He has taught us that the very notion of a formal
 axiomatic system is inadequate for capturing even the most basic of
 mathematical concepts. When we use the term 'arithmetic' without further
 qualification, we indeed mean the ordinary arithmetic which operates with the
 ordinary natural numbers 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, . . . (and perhaps their negatives) and
 not with some kind of 'supernatural' numbers. We may choose, if we wish, to
                                The Godelian case                             111

explore the properties of formal systems, and this is certainly a valuable part of
mathematical endeavour. But it is something different from exploring the
ordinary properties of the ordinary natural numbers. The situation is, in some
ways, perhaps not so very unlike that which occurs with geometry. The study
of non-Euclidean geometries is something mathematically interesting, with
important applications (such as in physics, see ENM Chapter 5 especially
Figs 5 . 1 and 5.2, and also §4.4), but when the term 'geometry' is used in
ordinary language (as distinct from when a mathematician or theoretical
physicist might use that term), we do indeed mean the ordinary geometry of
Euclid. There is a difference, however, in that what a logician might refer to as
'Euclidean geometry' can indeed be specified (with some reservations 6 ) in
terms of a particular formal system, whereas, as Godel has shown, ordinary
'arithmetic' cannot be so specified.
   Rather than showing that mathematics (most particularly arithmetic) is an
arbitrary pursuit, whose direction is governed by the whim of Man, GOdel
demonstrated that it is something absolute, there to be discovered rather than
invented (cf. § 1 . 17). We discover for ourselves what the natural numbers are,
and we do not have trouble in distinguishing them from any sort of
supernatural numbers. Godel showed that no system of'man-made' rules can,
by themselves, achieve this for us. Such a Platonic viewpoint was important to
Godel, and it will be important also for us in the later considerations of this
book (§8.7).

Ql7. Assume that the formal system IF is intended to represent the
mathematical truths in principle accessible to the mind. Can we not get around
the problem of being unable to incorporate the GOdel proposition G(IF) formally
into IF by, instead, incorporating something with the meaning of G(IF), using a
reinterpretation of the meanings of the symbols of IF?

   There are indeed ways of representing the Godel argument applied to IF
within a (sufficiently extensive) formal system IF, so long as the meanings of the
symbols of IF are reinterpreted as something different from those meanings
originally assigned to the symbols of IF. However, this is really cheating if we
are trying to interpret IF as the procedure whereby the mind reaches its
mathematical conclusions. The symbols of IF should not be allowed to shift
their meanings mid-stream if mental activities are to be interpreted solely in
terms of IF. If mental activities are allowed to contain something beyond the
operations of IF itself, namely the shifting meanings of these symbols, then we
need also to know the rules governing the detailed shifting of these meanings.
Either these rules are something non-algorithmic, whence the case for � is
made, or else there is some specific algorithmic procedure for this, in which
case we should have incorporated this procedure into our 'IF' in the first
place-call this system 1Ft-in order for it to represent the totality of our
insights, and it would not have been necessary for the meanings to shift at all.
1 12                              The Godelian case

In the latter case the Godel proposition G(Ft) takes the place of G(f") in the
previous discussion, and we have gained nothing.
Ql8. It is possible to formulate, within even such a simple system as Peano
arithmetic, a theorem whose interpretation has the implication:
                             'f" sound' implies 'G(f")'.
Is this not all we need from GOdel's theorem? Surely it would enable us to pass
from a belief in the soundness of any formal system f" to a belief in the truth of its
Godel proposition, so long as we are prepared to accept even just Peano
arithmetic?
   It is indeed true that such a theorem 7 can be formulated within Peano
arithmetic. More precisely (since we cannot properly encapsulate the notion of
'soundness' or 'truth' within any formal system-as follows by a famous
theorem of Tarski), what one actually formulates is a stronger result:
                           'f" consistent' implies 'G(f")';
or else:
                          'f" en-consistent' implies 'Q(f")'.
These have the implication needed for Ql8 because if f" is sound then it is
certainly consistent or en-consistent, as the case may be. Provided that we
understand the meanings of the symbolism used, then we can indeed pass from
a belief in the soundness of f" to a belief in the truth of G(f"). But this is already
accepted. If we understand meanings, then we can indeed pass from f" to G(f").
The trouble comes if we wish to eliminate the need for interpretations and to
make the passing from f" to G(f") automatic. If this were possible, then we could
automate the general 'Godelization' procedure, and build an algorithmic
device that indeed encompasses all that we require of Godel's theorem.
However, this cannot be done; for if we were to adjoin this putative
algorithmic procedure to whatever formal system f" we might choose to start
from, we should simply obtain, in effect, some new formal system f"#, and its
Godel proposition G(f"#) would lie outside f"#'s scope. There always remains
some aspect of the insight afforded by Godel's theorem, no matter how much of
it has been incorporated into a formalized or algorithmic procedure. This
'GOdelian insight' requires a continual reference to the actual meanings of the
symbols of whatever system Godel's procedure is being applied to. In this
sense, the trouble with Ql8 is very similar to that which arises with Ql7 above.
The fact that GOdelization cannot be automated is also closely related to the
discussion of Q6, above, and of Ql9 to follow.
   There is another aspect fo Ql8 which is worth considering. Imagine that we
have a sound formal system IHI which contains Peano arithmetic within it. The
theorem referred to in Ql8 will be amongst the implications of IHI , and the
                                          The Godelian case                                          1 13

particular instance of it which applies to the particular IF which is IHI itself will
be a theorem of IHI . Thus, we may say that one of !HI's implications is:
                                   'IHI sound' implies 'G(IHI )';

or, more precisely, that, for example:
                                 'IHI consistent' implies 'G(IHI )'.

Now these assertions would, in terms of their actual meanings, entail the
implication that G(IHI ) is, in effect, also being asserted. For-with regard to the
first of the two assertions above-any assertion that IHI makes is conditional
upon an assumption that IHI is sound in any case; so if IHI asserts something that
is explicitly conditional upon its own soundness, it might as well assert that
thing directly. (The assertion 'if I am to be believed, then X is true' entails the
simpler assertion, by the same speaker, 'X is true'.) However, a sound formal
system IHI cannot actually assert G(IHI ), which reflects the fact that it is incapable
of asserting its own soundness. Moreover, we see that it cannot actually
encapsulate the meanings of the symbols it operates with. The same facts are
illustrated in relation to the second of the above assertions, but with the added
irony that whereas IHI is incapable of asserting its own consistency when it in
fact is consistent, it suffers from no such inhibitions if it is inconsistent. An
inconsistent IHI can assert, as a 'theorem', anything at all that it can formulate!
It turns out that it can indeed formulate 'IHI is consistent'. A (sufficiently
extensive) formal system will assert its own consistency if and only if it is
inconsistent!
Q19. Why do we not just adopt a procedure of repeatedly adjoining the Godel
proposition G(IF) to whatever system IF we are currently accepting, and allow this
procedure to carry on indefinitely?

   Given any particular formal system IF, which is sufficiently extensive and
perceived to be sound, we can perceive how to adjoin G(IF) to IF as a new axiotn,
and thereby obtain a new system IF 1 , which is also perceived to be sound. (For
notational consistency with what follows, we may also write IF0 for IF.) We now
perceive how to adjoin G(IF 1 ) to IF 1 , thereby obtaining a new system IF 2 , also
perceived sound. Repeating the process, by adjoining G(IF 2 ) to IF 2 , we obtain
IF3, and so on. Now, with just a little more work, we should be able to see how
to construct yet another formal system IFw • whose axioms allow us to
incorporate precisely the entire infinite set { G ( IF 0 ), G ( IF 1 ), G ( IF 2 ) , G ( IF 3), . . . } as
additional axioms for IF. This system IF w will also be evidently sound. We can
continue the process, adjoining G ( IF w ) to IFw to obtain IFw + 1 , and then adjoining
G(IFw + 1 ) to this to obtain IF w + 2 , and so on. Then, as before, we can incorporate
the whole infinite set of axioms, now to obtain IFw 2 ( = IF w+w ) , which is again
evidently sound. Adjoining G(IF w 2 ) , we now obtain IF w 2 + 1 , and so on, and we
1 14                                The Godelian case

can again incorporate the infinite set to obtain IF w3 ( = IF w l + w ) . Repeating the
whole process, up to this point, all over again, we can obtain IF w4 and then,
repeating again, IF ws and so on. With just a little more work, we should be able
to see how to incorporate this entire set of new axioms { G(IF w ), G(IFw 2 ) , G(IF w 3 ) ,
G(IFw4 ) ,
         .   • } to form a system IF w2 ( = IFrow ) . Now, repeating the entire process
                 .



all over again, we obtain a new system IF w2 + w,, then IF w2 + w, + w , , etc., which,
when we see how to combine all these things together (with again some more
work), leads us to an even more comprehensive system IF w3' which must also be
sound.
    Those readers who are familiar with the notation for Cantor's ordinal
numbers .will recognize the suffixes that I have been using here as denoting
such ordinal numbers. Those unfamiliar with such things need not be troubled
about the precise meanings of these symbols. Suffice it to say that this
procedure of 'Godelization' can be continued even further-we reach systems
denoted by IF w•' IF ws, . . . , and then this leads to an even more inclusive system
                                                                            wro
IF wro ' and the process continues to still larger ordinals, such as w , etc.-so
long as we can see, at each step, how to systematize the entire set of
Godelizations that we have achieved up to that point. This, in fact, is the crux
of the matter: what has been referred to as 'with just a little more work'
requires the appropriate insights about how actually to systematize the
previous Godelizations. It is possible to achieve this systematization, provided
that the stage (ordinal) that has now been reached is labelled by what is called
a recursive ordinal, which means, in effect, that there is an algorithm of some
kind for generating the procedure. However, there is no algorithmic procedure
that one can lay down beforehand which allows us to do this systematization
for all recursive ordinals once and for all. We must continue to use our insights
afresh.
    The above procedure was first put forward by Alan Turing in his doctoral
thesis (and published in Turing 1939).8 Later, Solomon Feferman (1988)
showed that there is a sense in which any true II 1 -sentence can be proved by
repeated Godelization of the kind described here. However, this does not
provide us with a mechanical procedure for establishing the truth of
II 1 -sentences, for the very reason that one cannot mechanically systematize
GOdelization. In fact we can deduce that GOdelization cannot be made
mechanical just from Feferman's result. For we have already established
(effectively in §2.5) that the general ascertaining of the truth, or otherwise, of
II 1 -sentences cannot be decided by any algorithmic procedure. Thus the
repeated Godelization does not allow us to achieve anything in the way of a
systematic procedure that lies outside the computational considerations that
we have been concerned with up until now. Thus Q19 poses no threat to t§.

Q20. Surely the real value of mathematical understanding is not that it enables
us to achieve non-computable things, but that it enables us to replace enormously
complicated computations by comparatively simple insights? In other words, is
                                 The Gode/ian case                                1 15

it not the case that the mind allows us to take shortcuts with respect to
complexity theory rather than leap beyond the bounds of what is computable?
   I am quite prepared to believe that in practice a mathematician's insights are
much more frequently engaged in circumventing computational complexity,
rather than non-computability. After all, mathematicians tend to be
intrinsically lazy people, and they are often trying to find ways of avoiding
computation (despite the fact that this may well lead them into considerably
more difficult mental work than computation itself!). It is often the case that
attempts to make computers mindlessly churn out the theorems of even only
moderately complicated formal systems will quickly lead the computers to
become ensnared in virtually hopeless computational complexity-whereas,
armed with an understanding of the meanings underlying the rules of the
system, a human mathematician need have little trouble deriving many
interesting results within the system. 9
   The reason that I have concentrated on non-computability, in my
arguments, rather than on complexity, is simply that it is only with the former
that I have been able to see how to make the necessary strong statements. It
may well be that in the working lives of most mathematicians, non­
computability issues play, if anything, only a very small part. But that is not
the point at issue. I am trying to show that (mathematical) understanding is
something that lies beyond computation, and the Godel(-Turing) argument is
one of the few handles that we have on that issue. It is quite probable that our
mathematical insights and understandings are often used to achieve things
that could in principle also be achieved computationally-but where blind
computation without much insight may turn out to be so inefficient that it is
unworkable (cf. §3.26). However, these matters are much more difficult to
address than the non-computability issue.
   In any case, true though the sentiments expressed in Q20 may be, this in no
way contradicts '§.

                            Notes and references
 1 . It might seem that this is perfectly 'obvious'-and not something that could be
   a matter of dispute amongst mathematicians ! However, the problem comes
   about with the notion of 'existence' for large infinite sets. (See Smorynski 1 975,
   Rucker 1984, Moore 1990, for example.) We have seen from the example of the
   Russell paradox that one must be particularly careful in such matters.
   According to one point of view, a set would not be considered necessarily to
   exist unless there is at least some clear-cut rule (not necessarily a computable
   one) for specifying which things are to be in the set and which things are not.
   This is just what the axiom of choice does not provide, since there is no rule
   given for specifying which element is to be taken from each member of the
   collection. (Some of the implications of the axiom of choice are very non­
   intuitive-and almost paradoxical. Perhaps this is one reason that it is a
1 16                                 The Godelian case

       matter of some dispute. I am not even totally sure what my own position on
       this issue is ! )
 2.    In the final chapter of his 1966 book, Cohen makes the point that although he
       has shown that the continuum hypothesis is I!J N [) IEC m A IEin. IE according to the
       procedures of ZIF, he has left untouched the question of whether or not it is
       actually true-and he discusses how one might actually go about deciding this
       question ! This makes clear that he is not taking the view that it is an entirely
       arbitrary matter whether one accepts the continuum hypothesis or not. This is
       contrary to opinions often expressed about the implications of the Godel­
       Cohen results, namely that there are numerous 'alternative set theories' that are
       equally 'valid' for mathematics. By these remarks, Cohen reveals himself to be,
       like Godel, a true Platonist for whom matters of mathematical truth are
       absolute and not arbitrary. This is very much in accordance with my own
       views, cf. §8.7.
 3.    See, for example, Hofstadter (198 1 ), Bowie (1982).
 4.    For example, see various commentaries in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 13
       (1990), 643-705.
 5.    This terminology was suggested by Hofstadter (198 1 ). It is Godel's 'other'
       theorem-his completeness theorem-which tells us that such non-standard
       models always exist.
 6.    In fact, it depends upon which statements are considered as part of what is
       being called 'Euclidean geometry' here. In the usual terminology of the
       logicians, the system of 'Euclidean geometry' would only include statements of
       certain particular kinds, and it turns out that the truth or falsity of such
       statements can be resolved in terms of an algorithmic procedure-hence the
       assertion that Euclidean geometry can be specified in terms of a formal system.
       However, in other interpretations, ordinary 'arithmetic' might also be
       considered as part of 'Euclidean geometry', and this allows classes of
       statements that cannot be resolved algorithmically. The same would apply if we
       were to consider that the polyomino tiling problem is part of Euclidean
       geometry-which would seem to be a very natural thing to do. In this sense,
       Euclidean geometry can no more be formally specified than can arithmetic!

 An explicit Godelizing Turing machine




Suppose that we are given an algorithmic procedure A that we know
correctly ascertains that certain computations do not ever terminate. I shall
provide a completely explicit procedure for constructing, from A , a
particular computation C on which A fails; yet we shall be able to see that
C actually does not terminate. Taking this explicit expression for C, we can
examine its degree of complication and compare it with that of A , as is
needed for the arguments of §2.6 (cf. QS) and §3.20.
   For definiteness, I shall employ the particular Turing machine
specifications that I gave in ENM. For the complete details of these
specifications, the reader is referred to that volume. Here I shall merely
supply a minimal description that will be adequate for our present
purposes.
   A Turing machine has a finite number of internal states but it acts on an
infinite tape. The tape consists of a linear succession of 'boxes', where each
box can be either marked or unmarked, there being a finite total number of
marks on the tape altogether. Let us denote each marked box by the symbol
1 and each unmarked box by 0. There is a reading device which examines
one mark at a time and, explicitly dependent upon the Turing machine's
internal state and the nature of the mark that is being examined, three things
are next determined: (i) whether the mark on the box being examined is to
be altered or left alone, (ii) what the machine's new internal state is to be,
and (iii) whether the device is to move one step along the tape to the right
(denoted by R) or to the left (denoted by L ) or one step to the right with
the machine coming to a halt (denoted by SIDP ) . When the machine
eventually does come to a halt, the answer to the computation that it has
been performing is displayed as the succession of Os and ls to the left of
the reading device. Initially, the tape must be taken to be entirely blank
except for the marks defining the specific data (provided by a finite string of
ls and Os) upon which the machine is to perform its operations. The
reading device is initially taken to the left of all of the marks.

  When representing natural numbers on the tape, either in the input data
or in the output, it may be useful to use the expanded binary notation,
according to which the number is written, effectively, in the ordinary binary
scale, but where the binary digit ' 1 ' is written as 10 , the binary digit 0
                                                                            '   '



being written as 0 . Thus, we have the following scheme for translating
ordinary numerals into the expanded binary notation:


                               o - o
                               1     - 10
                               2     - 1 00
                               3     - 10 10
                               4     - 1 000
                               5       1 00 1 0
                               6     - 1 0 1 00
                               7       10 10 10
                               8     - 1 0000
                               9     - 1 000 1 0
                              10     - 1 00 1 00
                              11     - 1 00 1 0 1 0
                              12     - 1 0 1 000
                              13     - 1 0 1 00 1 0
                              14     - 1 0 1 0 1 00
                              15     - 10 10 10 10
                              16     - 1 00000
                              17     - 1 0000 1 0
                              etc.


We note that in the expanded binary notation, the immediate repetition of a
1 never occurs. Thus, we can signal the beginning and end of the
specification of a natural number by a succession of two or more 1s. Then
we can use the sequences 11 0 , 111 0 , 1 1 1 1 0 , etc., on the tape, to denote
various kinds of instruction.
   We can also use the marks on the tape to specify particular Turing
machines. This is needed when we consider the action of a universal Turing
machine U. The universal machine U acts upon a tape whose initial portion
provides the detailed specification of some particular given Turing machine
T which the universal machine is being told to imitate. The data on which T
itself is intended to be acting upon is then fed into U to the right of the
portion that determines the machine T. In order to specify the machine T,
we can use the sequences 11 0 , 111 0 , and 1 1 1 1 0 to denote, respectively,
the various instructions for T's reading device; namely to move along the
                  Appendix A : An explicit Godelizing Turing machine                 119

tape by one step to the right, by one step to the left, or to halt after moving
one step to the right:

                                    R - 110
                                    L ... 1110
                                 STOP ... 11110.

Immediately preceding each such instruction would be either the symbol 0
or the sequence 10, to indicate that the reading device is to mark the tape
with 0 or 1, respectively, in place of whatever symbol it has just been
reading. Immediately preceding the aforementioned 0 or 10 would be the
expanded binary expression for the number of the internal state into which
the Turing machine is to be placed next, according to this same instruction.
(We note that the internal states, being finite in number, can be labelled by
consecutive natural numbers 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , N. In the coding on the
tape, the expanded binary notation would be used to denote these
numbers.)
    The particular instruction to which this operation refers would be
determined by the internal state of the machine just prior to its reading the
tape, together with the symbol 0 or 1 that the reading device is about to
read and perhaps to alter. For example, as part of the specification of T,
might be some instruction 230 -+ 171R, which means: 'if T is in internal
state 23 and the reading device encounters 0 on the tape, then replace it by
 1, go into internal state 17 and move one step to the right along the tape'. In
this case, the part '171R' of the instruction would . be coded as
100001010110. Breaking this up as 1000010.10.110, we see that the
first portion is the expanded binary form of 17, the second codes the
marking of 1 on the tape, and the third portion codes the instruction 'move
to the right'. How do we specify the prior internal state (here the internal
state 23) and the mark on the tape being examined (here 0)? H desired, we
could also explicitly give these in terms of their expanded binary numbers.
However, this is not really necessary, since the numerical ordering of the
various instructions will suffice for this (i.e., the ordering 00 .... , 01 -+ , 10 .... ,
11 -+ ' 20 .... ' 21 -+ ' 30 .... ' . . . ) .
    This provides us with essentially the coding of Turing machines given in
ENM, but for completeness, a few additional points should be mentioned.
In the first place, we have to make sure that there is an instruction provided
for every one of the internal states, acting on 0 and on 1 (except that an
instruction for the highest-numbered internal state acting on 1 is not always
necessary) . Where there is never any use made of such an instruction in the
program, a 'dummy' must be inserted. For example, such a dummy
instruction could be 231 -+ OOR, if it happens to be the case that the internal
state 23 never needs to encounter the mark 1 in the running of the
program.
1 20               Appendix A: An explicit Godelizing Turing machine


    In the coded specification of a Turing machine on a tape, according to
the aforementioned prescriptions, the pair 00 would be represented by the
sequence 00, but one may economize and use a single 0, without
ambiguity, to separate the sequences of (more than one) 1s on either side.*
The Turing machine is to commence its operation in the internal state 0,
and the reading device moves along the tape maintaining this internal state
until it encounters its first 1. This is achieved by assuming that the
operation 00 -+ OOR is always part of a Turing machine's instructions. Thus,
in the actual specification of a Turing machine as a succession of Os and 1s,
it is not necessary to provide this instruction explicitly; instead, we start with
01 - X, where X denotes the first non-trivial operation of the machine that
is put in action, i.e. when the first 1 on the tape is encountered. This
suggests deleting the initial sequence 110 (denoting -+ OOR) that would
otherwise always occur in the sequence specifying a Turing machine.
Moreover, we shall also always delete the final sequence 110 in that
specification, since this, also is common to all Turing machines.
    The resulting sequence of digits 0 and 1 provides the (ordinary, i.e., non­
expanded) binary coding of the Turing machine number n of the machine in
question (as was given in ENM Chapter 2). We call this the nth Turing
machine, and we write T = Tn. Every such binary number, when the
sequence 110 is adjoined at the end, is a sequence of Os and 1s in which
there are never more than four 1s in succession. A number n for which this
is not the case would give a 'dud Turing machine' that would cease to
operate as soon as the 'instruction' involving more than four 1s is
encountered. Such a ' Tn' is said to be not correctly specified. Its action on
any tape is, by definition, considered to be non-terminating. Likewise, if a
Turing machine action encounters an instruction to enter a state specified
by a number that is larger than any for which further instructions are
actually listed, then it also would get 'stuck'; it would be considered to be a
'dud', and its action also counts as non-terminating. (It would be possible to
eliminate these awkward issues without a great deal of difficulty by the use
of various devices, but there is no real need to do this; cf. §2.6, Q4.)
    In order to see how to construct, from the given algorithm A , the
required explicit non-terminating computation on which A must fail,

          * T his means that in the coding of a Turing machine, each occurrence of the
       sequence . . . 110011 . . . can be replaced by . . . 11011. . . . There are 15
       places in the specification of the universal Turing machine that I gave in ENM
       (cf. end-note 7 to Chapter 2) where I had omitted to do this. T his is a matter of
       definite irritation to me, because I had taken some considerable pains, under
       the constraints of the prescriptions that I had given, to achieve a number for
       this universal machine that was as small as I could reasonably achieve. Making
       the aforementioned simple replacements provides a number over 30 000 times
       smaller than the one I gave! I am grateful to Steven Gunhouse for pointing this
       oversight out to me, and also for independently checking that the specification,
       as printed, does in fact provide a universal Turing machine.
                  Appendix A: An explicit Godelizing Turing machine       121

we shall need to suppose that A is given as a Turing machine. This machine
acts on a tape coding two natural numbers p and q. It is to be assumed that
if the computation A (p, q ) terminates, then the action of the computation T
                                                                             P
on the number q does not ever terminate. Recall that if TP is not correctly
specified, then we must consider that its action on q does not terminate
whatever q might be. For any such 'disallowed' p, any result for A (p, q )
whatever would be consistent with our assumptions. Accordingly, I need be
concerned only with numbers p for which TP is correctly specified. Thus,
the binary expression for the number p, as represented on a tape, can
contain no sequence . . . 11111 . . . . This allows us to use the specific
sequence 11111 to mark the beginning and end of the number p, as
represented on the tape.
    However, we are also required to do the same for q, which need not be
restricted to be a number of this type. This presents us with a technical
awkwardness, for the Turing-machine prescriptions as I have given them,
and it will be convenient to circumvent it by use of the device of taking the
numbers p and q to be effectively written in the quinquary scale. (This is
the scale where '10' denotes the number five, '100' denotes twenty-five, '44'
denotes twenty-four etc.) But rather than employing the quinquary digits 0,
 1, 2, 3, and 4, I shall use the respective tape sequences 0, 10, 110, 1110,
and 11110. Thus:
              0     is represented by the sequence      0
              1                                         10

122               Appendix A : A n explicit Godelizing Turing machine


   The notation ' Cp' will be used here for the correctly specified Turing
machine T,., where r is the number whose ordinary binary expression,
together with the sequence 110 appended at the end, is precisely the
quinquary expression for p, as in the description given above. The number
q, upon which the computation CP acts, is also to be expressed in the
quinquary notation. The computation A(p,q) is to be described as a Thring
machine acting upon a tape coding the pair of numbers p, q. This coding on
this tape is to be taken as follows:
                   . . . 00111110p111110q11111000 . . . '
where p and q are the respective quinquary notations for p and q, as above.
   What we require is to find a p and a q for which we know that CP ( q )
does not terminate, but for which A(p,q) also fails to terminate. The
procedure of §2.5 achieves this by finding a number k for which Ck acting
on n is precisely A( n, n) , for each n, and then putting p = q = k. To achieve
this explicitly, we seek a Thring-machine prescription K( = Ck) whose action
on a tape marked:
                          . . . 00111110n11111000 . . .
(n being the quinquary expression for n ) is precisely the same as the action
of A on:
                   . . . 00111110n111110n11111000 . . . ,
for each n. Thus, what K has to do is to take the number n (written in
quinquary notation) and to copy it once, where the sequence 111110
separates the two occurrences of n (and a similar sequence initiates and
terminates the entire sequence of marks on the tape) . Subsequently, it has to
act upon the resulting tape in precisely the same way in which A would
have acted upon that tape.
   An explicit modification of A that provides such a K is achieved as
follows. First, we find the initial instruction 01 - X, in the specification of A
and take note of what this 'X' actually is. We are going to substitute this for
the 'X' in the specification given below. As a technical point, we must also
assume that A is" expressed in such a way that the internal state 0 of A is
never actually en tered again after the instruction 01 - X is activated. There
is no restriction involved in insisting that A has this form.* (It is all right for
0 to be used in dummy instructions, but not elsewhere.)
        * In fact, one of Turing's actual original proposals was to have the machine
      halt whenever the internal state '0' is re-entered from some other internal state.
      In this way, not only would the above restriction be unnecessary, but the
      instruction SlOP could be dispensed with. A simplification would thereby be
      achieved because 11110 would not be needed as an instruction and could be
      used as the marker instead, rather than 111110. This would significantly
      shorten my prescription for K, and we would use the quaternary rather than
      the quinquary numbering system.
                Appendix A : An explicit Godelizing Turing machine          123

   Next, the total number N of internal states in A's specification must be
ascertained (including the state 0, so that the largest internal state number
of A is N - 1 ) . If A's specification contains no final instruction of the form
(N - 1 ) 1 - Y, then a dummy instruction (N - 1 ) 1 - 00R must then be
adjoined at the end. Finally, we remove 01 - X from A's specification and
adjoin to this specification the Turing-machine instructions listed below,
where each internal-state number that appears in the list must be increased
by N, where tjJ represents the resulting internal state 0, and where the 'X' in
'11 - X' below is the instruction we have taken note of above. (In particular,
the first two instructions below would become 01 - NlR, NO ... (N + 4 )OR.)

   We are now in a position to give a precise limit on the size of K, as
obtained by the above construction, as a function of the size of A. Let us
measure this 'size' as the 'degree of complication', defined in §2.6 (end of
response to Q8). For a specific Thring machine Tm (such as A), this is the
number of digits in the binary representation of the number m. For a
particular Turing-machine action Tm ( n ) (such as K ) , this is the number of
1 24            Appendix A : An explicit Godelizing Turing machine


binary digits in the greater of m and n. Let      a   and   K,   respectively, be the
number of binary digits in a and k', where



Since A has at least 2N - 1 instructions (with the first instruction being
omitted) , and since each instruction takes up at least three binary digits in
its binary specification, the total number of binary digits in its Turing­
machine number a must certainly satisfy

                                   ex � 6N - 6.
There are 105 places (to the right of the arrows) in the above additional list
of instructions for K where the number N must be added to the number
that appears there. The resulting numbers are all less than N + 55 and
therefore have expanded binary representations with not more than
2 log2(N + 5 5) digits each, giving a total of less than 210 log2(N + 55) binary
digits for the extra specification of internal states. We must add to this the
digits needed for the extra symbols 0, 1, R, and L , which amount to
another 527 (including one possible additional 'dummy' instruction, and
bearing in mind that six of the Os can be eliminated according to the rule
whereby 00 can be represented as 0), so we can be sure that the
specification of K requires fewer than 527 + 210 log2(N + 55) digits more
than that of A does:

                       K   < ex + 527 + 210 log2(N + 55).
Using the relation ex � 6N - 6 obtained above, we find (noting that
210 log26 > 542)

                       K   < ex - 15 + 210 log2( cx + 336).
   Now, let us find the degree of complication 'YJ of the particular
computation Ck(k) that this procedure provides. Recall that the degree of
complication of Tm ( n ) was defined as the number of binary digits in the
larger of the two numbers m, n. In the present situation, we have Ck Tk., so=



the number of binary digits in the ' m ' for this computation is just K. To see
how many binary digits there are in the 'n' for this computation, we examine
the tape that is involved in Ck( k) . This tape is initiated by the sequence
111110, which is immediately followed by the binary expression for k',
and then terminated by the sequence 11011111. The conventions of ENM
require that this entire sequence, but with the last digit deleted, be read as a
binary number, in order that we obtain the 'n' which numbers the tape in
the computation Tm ( n ) . Hence the number of binary digits in this particular
'n' is precisely K + 13, so it follows that K + 13 is also the degree of
                Appendix A : An explicit Godelizing Turing machine              125

complication 'fJ o f Ck ( k ) , whence 'fJ = 1e + 13 < a - 2 + 2 1 0 log2( a + 336),
from which follows the simpler-looking expression
                           'fJ   < a + 210 log2(a + 336).
   The specific details of the foregoing argument are features of the
particular codings for Turing machines that have been adopted, and they
would be somewhat different in some other coding. The basic idea itself is
a very simple one. In fact, had a A. - calculus formalism been adopted, then
the entire operation would have been in a sense, reduced almost to
triviality. (See ENM, end of Chapter 2, for an adequate enough
description of Church's A. -calculus; see also Church 1941 .) We may think
of A as being defined by a ). -calculus operator A , acting on other
operators P and Q, as expressed by the operation (AP )Q. Here P
represents the computation CP , and Q stands for the number q. Then the
requirement for A is that, for all such P, Q, the following holds.
             If (AP )Q terminates, then PQ does not terminate.
We can easily construct a ). -calculus operation which does not terminate,
but for which A fails to ascertain this fact. This is achieved by taking
                                    K = A. x.[(Ax)x]
so that KY = (AY ) Y for all operators Y. Then we consider the ). -calculus
operation
                                          KK.
This clearly does not terminate, because KK = (AK)K, the terminating of
which would imply that KK does not terminate, by the assumed nature of
A . Moreover A cannot ascertain this fact because (AK)K does not
terminate. If we believe that A has its required property, then we must
also believe that KK does not terminate.
   Note that there is a considerable economy in this procedure. If we
write KK in the form
                           KK = A.y.[yy] (A.x.[(Ax)x]) .
Then w e see that the number of symbols in KK i s merely 1 6 greater than
the number in A (ignoring the dots, which are redundant, in any case) !
   Strictly speaking, this is not entirely legitimate, because the symbol 'x'
might also appear in the expression for A , and some means would need to
be adopted for dealing with this fact. Also, one might perceive a difficulty
in that the non-terminating computation that this procedure generates is
not something that appears as an operation on natural numbers (since the
second K in KK is not a 'number') . In fact, the A. -calculus is not well
126            Appendix A : A n explicit Godelizing Turing machine


suited to dealing with explicit numerical operations, and it is often not easy
to see how a given algorithmic procedure applied to natural numbers can
be expressed as a A. -calculus operation. For reasons such as these, the
discussion in terms of Turing machines has a greater direct relevance to our
discussions, and it more clearly achieves what is required.

      The case for non-computability in
                 mathematical thought




           3 . 1 What did Go del and Turing think?
In Chapter 2, I have tried to demonstrate for the reader the power and the
rigorous nature of the underlying case for the assertion (denoted by <;§) that
mathematical understanding cannot be the result of some consciously
appreciated and totally believed algorithm (or, equivalently, algorithms; cf.
Ql ). These arguments do not address the more serious possibility-in
accordance with <;§-that mathematical belief might be the result of an
unknown unconscious algorithm, or possibly of a knowable algorithm that
cannot be known to be-o r firmly believed to be-one that underlies
mathematical belief. It is my purpose, in this chapter, to demonstrate that,
although such are logical possibilities, they are not at all plausible ones.
   It should first be pointed out that when mathematicians produce their
careful chains of conscious reasoning for establishing mathematical truths,
they do not think that they are merely blindly following unconscious rules that
they are incapable of both knowing and believing. What they think they are
doing is basing their arguments upon what are unassailable truths­
ultimately, essentially 'obvious' ones-building their chains of reasoning
entirely from such truths . And though these chains may sometimes be
extremely long, involved, or conceptually subtle, the reasoning is, in principle
and at root, unassailable, firmly believed, and logically impeccable . They do
not tend to think that they are really acting according to some quite different
unknown or unbelieved procedures, perhaps 'behind the scenes' guiding their
beliefs in unknowable ways .
   Of course, they might be wrong about this. Perhaps there is, indeed, an
algorithmic procedure that, unknown to them, governs all of their mathe­
matical perceptions. It is probably easier for a non-mathematician to take
such a possibility seriously than it is for most working mathematicians. In this
chapter, I shall try to persuade the reader that such working mathematicians
are right in their opinion that they are not merely responding to an unknown
(and unknowable) algorithm-nor to an algorithm that they do not firmly
believe in. It may well be that their thoughts and beliefs are indeed guided by
1 28          The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

some unknown unconscious principles; but I shall argue that if this is so, then
these principles are things that cannot be described in algorithmic terms.
   It is instructive to consider the viewpoints of the two leading mathematical
figures who are essentially responsible for the very argument that has led us to
our conclusion t'§. What, indeed, did GOdel think? What did Turing think? It is
remarkable how, when presented with the same mathematical evidence, they
came to basically opposite conclusions. It should be made clear, however, that
both these outstanding thinkers expressed viewpoints in accordance with the
conclusion t'§. GOdel's viewpoint seems to have been that the mind is indeed
not constrained by having to be a computational entity, and is not even
constrained by the finiteness of the brain. Indeed, he chastized Turing for not
accepting this as a possibility. According to Hao Wang (1974, p. 326, cf. also
GOdel (1990) Collected Works Vol II, p. 297), while accepting both of Turing's
implicit contentions that 'the brain functions basically like a digital computer'
and that 'the physical laws, in their observable consequences, have a finite
limit of precision', Godel rejected Turing's other contention that 'there is no
mind separate from matter', referring to it as 'a prejudice of our time'. Thus,
GOdel appears to have taken it as evident that the physical brain must itself
behave computationally, but that the mind is something beyond the brain, so
that the mind's action is not constrained to behave according to the
computational laws that he believed must control the physical brain's
behaviour. He did not regard t'§ as a proof of his viewpoint that the mind acts
non-computationally, for he allowed 1 that:

       On the other hand, on the basis of what has been proved so far, it
       remains possible that there may exist (and even be empirically
       discoverable) a theorem-proving machine which in fact is equivalent to
       mathematical intuition, but cannot be proved to be so, nor even proved
       to yield only correct theorems of finitary number theory.

It should be made clear that this is indeed consistent with a belief in t'§ (and I
have no doubt that Godel was well aware of some such clear-cut conclusion
as I have stated as 't'§'). He allowed the logical possibility that the minds of
human mathematicians might act according to some algorithm of which they
are not aware, or perhaps they could be aware of it provided that they could
not be unassailably convinced of its soundness (' . . . cannot be proved . . . to
yield only correct theorems . . .'). Such an algorithm comes under the
category of 'unknowably sound', in my own terminology. Of course, it would
have been another matter altogether actually to believe that such an
unknowably sound algorithm might actually underlie the actions of a
mathematician's mind. It seems that Godel did not believe it, and found
himself seemingly driven in the mystical direction that I have denoted by
�-that the mind cannot be explained at all in terms of the science of the
physical world.
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought           1 29

   On the other hand, Turing appears to have rejected such a mystical
standpoint, believing (as Godel did) that the physical brain, like any other
physical object, must act in a computational way (recall 'Turing's thesis', §1 .6).
Thus, he had to .find some other route around the case provided, in effect, by '§.
Turing made a great point of the fact that human mathematicians are very
capable of making mistakes; he argued that for a computer to be able to be
genuinely intelligent, it, also, would have to be allowed to make mistakes: 2
      In other words then, if a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot
      also be intelligent. There are several theorems which say almost exactly
      that. But these theorems say nothing about how much intelligence may
      be displayed if a machine makes no pretence at infallibility.
The 'theorems' he had in mind are undoubtedly Godel's theorem and others
related to it, such as his own 'computational' version ofGodel's theorem. Thus
he appears to have regarded the inaccuracy of human mathematical thinking
as essential, allowing the mind's (supposed) inaccurate algorithmic action to
provide a greater power than that which would be achievable by means of any
completely sound algorithmic procedure. Accordingly, he suggested a way of
evading the conclusions of the Godel argument: the mathematician's
algorithm would be technically unsound, and it certainly would not be
'knowably sound'. Thus, Turing's viewpoint would be consistent with '§, and it
seems probable that he would have agreed with viewpoint .91.
   As part of the following discussion, I shall be presenting my reasons for
disbelieving that 'unsoundness' in a mathematician's algorithm can be the real
explanation for what is going on in a mathematician's mind. There is, in any
case, a certain intrinsic implausibility in the idea that what makes the mind
superior to an accurate computer is the mind's inaccuracy-especially when
we are concerned, as here, with the mathematician's ability to perceive
unassailable mathematical truth, rather than with mathematical originality or
creativity. lt is a striking fact that each of these two great thinkers, Godel and
Turing, found himself driven, by considerations such as '§, to what many
might regard as a somewhat implausible standpoint. It is interesting to
speculate on whether they would have found themselves so driven had they
been in a position to contemplate the serious possibility that physical action
might, at root, sometimes be non-computable-in accordance with the
viewpoint C(f that I am promoting here.
   In the following sections (particularly §3.2-§3.22) I shall be giving some
detailed arguments, some of which are rather complicated, confusing, or
technical, which are aimed at ruling out either computational model d or fJI as
providing a plausible basis for mathematical understanding. My recom­
mendation to the reader who needs no such persuasion--or who is daunted by
details-is to read as far as he or she feels inclined, but then when the going gets
tedious, pass directly to the summarizing fantasy dialogue of §3.23. Please
return to the main argument only if and when it is so desired.
130           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought


  3 .2 Could an unsound algorithm knowably simulate
                    mathematical understanding?
We must consider that, in accordance with r§, mathematical understanding
might be the result of some algorithm that is unsound or unknowable, or
possibly sound and knowable but not knowably sound-or there might
perhaps be various different such algorithms corresponding to different
mathematicians. By an 'algorithm' is meant just some computational
procedure (as in §1 .5}--that is, anything that could be simulated in principle
on a general-purpose computer with an unlimited store. (We may recall from
the discussion of Q8, in §2.6, that the 'unlimited' nature of this store, in this
idealization, does not detract from the argument.) Now, this notion of
'algorithm' would include top-down procedures and bottom-up learning
systems, as well as combinations of both. Anything that can be achieved by
artificial neural networks, for example, would be included (cf. §1 .5). So
would other types of bottom-up mechanisms such as those referred to as
'genetic algorithms', which improve themselves by some built-up procedure
analogous to Darwinian evolution (cf. §3. 1 1 ).
   In §3.9-§3.22 (as summarized in the fantasy dialogue of §3.23) I shall
show specifically how bottom-up procedures are essentially encompassed by
the arguments that are to be given in the present section (and also by those
that were put forward in Chapter 2). However, for purposes of clarity, I shall
for the moment phrase things as though there were just a single top-down
type of algorithmic action involved. This algorithmic action might be
thought of as relevant either to a particular individual mathematician or to
the mathematical community as a whole. In the discussions of Q l l and Ql2,
in §2. 1 0, the possibility of there being different sound and known algorithms
pertinent to different people was considered, and it was concluded that this
possibility did not significantly affect the argument. The possibility of there
being different unsound or unknowable algorithms pertinent to different
 people will be returned to later (cf. §3.7). For now, let us phrase things,
primarily, as though there is just a single algorithmic procedure underlying
mathematical understanding. We may also restrict attention merely to that
body of mathematical understanding which can be used to establish
 111-sentences (i.e. the specification of Turing-machine actions that do
not terminate, cf. commentary on QlO). In what follows, it is sufficient
if we interpret the phrase 'mathematical understanding' in this restricted
context (see r§ ** , p. 100).
   We must distinguish clearly between three distinct standpoints with regard
 to the knowability of a putative algorithmic procedure F underlying
 mathematical understanding, whether sound or not. For F might be:
  I consciously knowable, where its role as the actual algorithm underlying
      mathematical understanding is also knowable;
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought             131

 II consciously knowable, but its role as the actual algorithm underlying
    mathematical understanding is unconscious and not knowable;
III unconscious and not knowable.

   Let us consider the completely conscious case I first. Since the algorithm
and its role are both knowable, we may just as well consider that it, and its role,
are already known. For, in our imagination, we can suppose that we are
applying our arguments at such a time when these things are actually known­
for 'knowable' means that, at least in principle, such a time could arise. So, let
us consider that the algorithm Fis a known one, its underlying role being also
known. We have seen (§2.9) that such an algorithm is effectively equivalent to
a formal system IF. Thus, we are supposing that mathematical understand­
ing-or at least any particular mathematician's understanding-is known (by
that mathematician) to be equivalent to derivability within some known
formal system IF. To have any hope of satisfying our conclusion t§, which was
forced upon us by our considerations in the preceding chapter, we must
suppose that the system IF is unsound. Strangely enough, however, unsound­
ness does not help at all for a known formal system IF which, as asserted in I, is
actually known-and thus believed-by any mathematician to underlie his or
her mathematical understanding! For such a belief entails a (mistaken) belief
in IF's soundness. (It would be an unreasonable mathematical standpoint that
allows for a disbelief in the very basis of its own unassailable belief system !)
Whether or not IF is actually sound, a beliefthat it is sound entails a belief that
G(IF) (or, alternatively, Q(IF), cf. §2.8) is true; but since G(IF) is now-by a belief
in Godel's theorem-believed to lie outside the scope of IF, this contradicts the
belief that IF underlies all (relevant) mathematical understanding. (This works
just as well whether applied to individual mathematicians or to the
mathematical community; it can be applied separately to any of the various
different algorithms that might be supposed to underlie different mathematic­
ians' thought processes. Moreover, it need refer only to that body of
mathematical understanding that is pertinent to the establishment of
fl 1 -sentences.) Thus, any putative known unsound algorithm IF that is
supposed actually to underlie mathematical understanding cannot be known
to do so, whence I is ruled out irrespective of whether IF is or is not sound. If IF
itself is knowable, we are left with the possibility II: that IF might indeed
underlie mathematical understanding, but it cannot be known to have this
role. There is also the possibility III that the system IF might itself be
unconscious and unknowable.
   What we have essentially established, at this juncture, is that case I (at least
in the context of entirely top-down algorithms) is not a serious possibility; the
fact that IF might actually be unsound has, somewhat remarkably, no
importance to I whatever. The crucial thing is that the putative IF, whether
sound or not, cannot be known to underlie mathematical belief; it is not the
132           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

unknowability of the algorithm itself that is at issue, but the unknowability of
that algorithm actually being the one that underlies understanding.


        3 . 3 Could a knowable algorithm unknowably
              simulate mathematical understanding?
We come now to case II , and try to take seriously the possibility that
mathematical understanding might indeed be actually equivalent to some
consciously knowable algorithm or formal system, but unknowably so. Thus,
although the putative formal system IF would be a knowable one, we could
never be sure that this particular system actually does underlie our
mathematical understandings. Let us ask ourselves if this possibility is at all
plausible.
   If this putative IF is not an already known formal system then, as before, we
must take it that it could, at least in principle, be known someday. Imagine
that such a day has arrived and suppose that the precise specification of IF is set
out before us. The formal system IF, though possibly quite elaborate, is
supposed to be simple enough that we are able, at least in principle, to
appreciate it in a perfectly conscious way; but we are not allowed to be sure
that IF actually encompasses precisely the totality of our unassailable
mathematical understandings and insights (at least, with regard to
Il csentences). We shall try to see why this, though a logical possibility, is a
very implausible one. Moreover, I shall later argue that even if it were true,
such a possibility would provide no solace to practitioners of AI intent on
building a robot mathematician ! This aspect of things will be returned to at the
end of this section, and will be addressed more fully in §3. 1 5 and §3.29.
   To emphasize the fact that the existence of such an IF must indeed be
considered to be a logical possibility, we may recall the 'theorem-proving
machine' that Godel remarked could not (as yet) be logically ruled out (cf.
quote given in §3. 1 ). In effect, this 'machine' would, as I shall explain, be an
algorithmic procedure F in accordance with one of the above cases II or m.
GOdel's putative theorem-proving machine might, as he pointed out, be
'empirically discoverable', which corresponds to the requirement that F be
'consciously knowable' as in II , or it might not be, which is basically case m.
   GOdel had argued, taking account of his famous theorem, that the
procedure F (or, equivalently, formal system IF; cf. §2.9) could not be 'proved'
to be 'equivalent to mathematical intuition'-as his quotation indeed asserts.
In II (and, by implication, in ill also) I have stated this fundamental limitation
on F in a somewhat different way: 'its role as the actual algorithm underlying
mathematical understanding is unconscious and not knowable'.
   This limitation (whose necessity follows from the rejection of I , as was
argued in §3.2) clearly does have the implication that F canot be shown to be
equivalent to mathematical intuition, since such a demonstration would
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought            133

establish for us that Findeed has the role that we are supposed not to be able to
know it has. Conversely, if this very role of F, in providing the basis for
unassailable mathematical understanding, were something that could be
consciously known-in the sense of it being fully appreciated how Facts in this
role-then the soundness of Fwould have to be accepted also. For if Fwere not
being fully accepted as sound, this amounts to a refusal to accept some of its
consequences. But its consequences are precisely those mathematical
propositions (or, at least, IIcsentences) which are being accepted. Thus,
knowing the role of F amounts to possessing a proof of F, although such a
'proof' would not be a formal proof in some preassigned formal system.
   We note, also, that valid II csentences might be regarded as examples of the
'correct theorems of finitary number theory' that Godel referred to. In fact, if
the term 'finitary number theory' is taken to include the }1-operation 'find the
smallest natural number with such-and-such arithmetical property', in which
case it includes the actions of Turing machines (see end of §2.8), then all
II 1 -sentences would count as being part of finitary number theory. Thus, it
would appear that Godel-type reasoning provides no clear way of ruling out
case II on rigorous logical grounds alone-at least if we accept the authority of
Godel!
   On the other hand, we may ask ourselves whether II is at all a plausible
possibility. Let us try to see what the existence of a knowable IF, unknowably
equivalent to human (unassailable) mathematical understanding, would
entail. As remarked above, we may imagine that a time has arrived at which
this IF has been encountered, and is set out before us. Recall ( §2. 7) that a formal
system is specified in terms of a set of axioms and rules of procedure. The
theorems of IF are things ('propositions') that can be obtained from the axioms
by means of the rules of procedure, all theorems being things that can be
formulated in terms of the same symbols that are used in order to express the
axioms. What are we trying to imagine is that the theorems of IF are precisely
those propositions (written in terms of these symbols) which can in principle be
perceived as unassailably true, by human mathematicians.
   Let us suppose, for the moment, that the list of axioms in IF is a finite list.
Now, the axioms themselves always have to count as particular instances of
theorems. But each theorem is something that can in principle be perceived as
unassailably true by use of human understanding and insight. Hence, each
axiom individually must express something that is, in principle, part of this
mathematical understanding. Thus, for any individual axiom, there will come
a time (or there could in principle come a time) when it is perceived as being
unassailably true. One after the other, individual axioms of IF could be so
perceived. Thus, eventually, all the axioms will be individually perceived as
unassailably true (or could in principle eventually be so perceived).
Accordingly, there eventually comes a time when the totality of the axioms of IF
is perceived, as a whole, to be unassailably valid.
   What about the rules of procedure? Can we envisage a time when these,
1 34           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

also, are perceived as unassailably sound? For many formal systems, these
could just be simple things which are all 'unassailably' acceptable, like: 'If we
have already established P as a theorem, and also P=>Q as a theorem, then we
may deduce Q as a new theorem' (cf. ENM p. 393, or Kleene 1952, with regard
to the symbol '=>', meaning 'implies'). For such rules, there would be no
difficulty about accepting them as unassailable. On the other hand, there
might be some much more subtle means of inference, included among the rules
of procedure, whose validity is not at all obvious, and which might require
delicate consideration before one could come to a decision as to whether or not
to accept such a rule as 'unassailably sound'. In fact, as we shall see in a
moment, there must be amongst IF's rules of procedure certain rules whose
unassailable soundness can not be perceived by human mathematicians­
where we are still assuming that the axioms of IF are finite in number.
   Why is this? Let us, in our imaginations, return to the time when the axioms
are all perceived as unassailably true. We sit back to contemplate the entire
system IF. Let us try to suppose that the rules of procedure of IF are also things
that we can now accept unassailably. Although we are not supposed to be able
to know that IF actually encompasses everything mathematical that is in
principle accessible to human understanding and insight, we should, by now,
at least have convinced ourselves that IF is unassailably sound, since both its
axioms and rules of procedure are unassailably accepted. We must therefore
also be now convinced that IF is consistent. The thought would occur to us, of
course, that G(IF) must also be true, by virtue of this consistency-indeed
unassailably true ! But since IF is being supposed, in fact (but unknown to us), to
encompass the entirety of what is unassailably accessible by us, G(IF) must
actually be a theorem of IF. But, by GOdel's theorem, this can only be so if IF is in
fact inconsistent. If IF is inconsistent, then '1 = 2' is a theorem of IF. Hence the
assertion that 1 = 2 would have to be, in principle, part of our unassailable
mathematical understanding-which is surely a clear contradiction!
   This notwithstanding, we must at least entertain the possibility that human
mathematicians might (unknowably) operate according to an IF which is
actually unsound. I shall address this issue in §3.4; but for the purposes of the
present section, let us accept that the procedures which underlie mathematical
understanding are actually perfectly sound. In such circumstances it follows
that a contradiction has indeed been arrived at, if we are to assume that the
rules of procedure of our finite-axiomed IF are all unassailably acceptable.
Hence there must be, amongst IF's rules of procedure, at least one that cannot
be unassailably perceived as sound by human mathematicians (though it is
indeed som. d).
   All this was on the basis that IF possesses only a finite number of axioms. A
possible alternative let-out would be that the list of axioms of IF might be
infinite. I should make a comment concerning this possibility. In order for IF to
qualify as a formal system in the required sense-so that one may always
check, by means of a preassigned computational procedure, that a purported
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought                  135

proof of some proposition is indeed a proof according to IF's rules-it is
necessary that its infinite axiom system be expressible in finitely based terms.
In fact, there is always some freedom about the way in which a formal system is
represented, whereby its operations are designated as either 'axioms' or 'rules
of procedure'. In fact, the standard axiomatic system for set theory-the
Zermelo-Fraenkel system (that I am denoting here by .ZIF}--possesses
infinitely many axioms, expressed in terms of structures called 'axiom
schemata'. By an appropriate reformulation, the .ZIF system can be re­
expressed so that the number of actual axioms becomes finite 3 • In fact, in a
certain sense, this can always be done for axiom systems that are 'formal
systems' in the computational sense required here. *
   One might imagine, therefore, that one could apply the above argument,
aimed towards the ruling out of case II, to any (sound) IF, irrespective of
whether its axioms are infinite or finite in number. Indeed, this is so, but in the
process of reducing the axiom system from an infinite to a finite one, one may
introduce new rules of procedure that might not be self-evidently sound. Thus,
when in accordance with the ideas described above we contemplate a time at
which the axioms and rules of procedure of IF are all laid out before us, the
theorems of this putative IF being supposed to be precisely those which are in
principle accessible to human understanding and insight, we cannot be sure
that the rules of procedure of this IF, unlike its axioms, can ever be unassailably
perceived as sound, even though they are in fact sound. For, unlike axioms,
rules of procedure do not number amongst the theorems of a formal system. It
is merely the theorems of IF that are taken to be the things that can be
unassailably perceived.
   It is not clear to me whether this argument can be taken much further, in
strictly logical terms. What we have to be able to accept, if we believe in II, is
that there is some formal system IF (underlying human perceptions as to the
truth of II 1 -sentences) that can be perfectly well appreciated by human
mathematicians, whose finite list of axioms is (unassailably) acceptable, but
those finite system of rules of procedure 92 contains at least one operation that
is regarded as fundamentally dubious. All the theorems of IF would have to
turn out, individually, to be things that can be perceived as true-somewhat
miraculously, since many of them would be obtained by use of the dubious
rules of 92. Now, although each of these theorems can individually be perceived
as true (in principle) by human mathematicians, there is no uniform way of
doing this. We may restrict attention to those theorems of IF which are
II 1 -sentences. By use of the dubious 92, the entire list of ii csentences that can
be perceived as true by human mathematicians can be computationally
generated. Individually, any one of these Il csentences can be ultimately
perceived as true by human insight. But, in each case, this is by using some
         *There is a rather trivial sense in which this can be done, where we simply
      interpret the operation of the Turing machine which effects the algorithm F
      appropriately as the rules of procedure of the required system.
1 36            The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

means of reasoning that it quite distinct from the rule 9t by which it is
obtained. Again and again, some new and increasingly sophisticated human
insight must be brought in, so that each il 1 -sentence can be reduced to
unassailable truth. As if by magic, each of these il 1 -sentences turns out to be
true, but some of them can only be perceived as true by bringing in a
fundamentally new type of reasoning, a requirement that comes in again and
again at deeper and deeper levels. Moreover, any il 1 -sentence that can be
perceived as unassailably true-by whatever means-will be found in the list
generated by 9t. Finally, there will be a specific true il 1 -sentence O(IF) that can
be constructed explicitly from a knowledge of the system IF, but whose truth
cannot be perceived as unassailably true by human mathematicians. The best
that they could do would be to see that the truth of O(IF) depends precisely
upon the soundness of the dubious procedure 9t which seems miraculously to
be able to generate precisely all the il 1 -sentences that can be unassailably
humanly perceived.
    I can imagine that some people might regard this as perhaps not altogether
unreasonable. There are many instances of mathematical results which can be
obtained by means of what might be called 'heuristic principles', where such a
principle would not supply a proofof the required result, but it would lead one
to anticipate that the result indeed ought to be true. Subsequently, a proof
might be obtained along some quite different lines. However, it seems to me
that such heuristic principles really have rather little in common with our
putative !Jt. Such principles are things that actually enhance our conscious
understandings of why some mathematical results are actually true.* Later on,
when mathematical techniques become further developed, it often becomes
fully understood why such a heuristic principle works. But more usually, what
would become fully understood would be the circumstances under which the
principle can be trusted to work, there being others where it cannot be so
trusted-so that erroneous conclusions are obtained when due care is not
exercised. With the exercise of such care, the very principle itself becomes a
powerful and trustworthy tool of unassailable mathematical proof. Rather
than providing us with a miraculously reliable algorithmic process for
establishing il 1 -sentences, where the reason that the algorithm works is
inaccessible to human insight, heuristic principles provide a means of
enhancing our mathematical insights and understandings. This is something
 very different from the algorithm F (or formal system IF) that is needed for case
 II. Moreover, there has never been any proposal for a heuristic principle which
         *A heuristic principle of this kind might take the form of a conjecture, like the
       important Taiyama conjecture (which became generalized to what is known as the
       'Langland's philospophy'), from which that most famous of all n 1-sentences,
       known as 'Fermat's last theorem' (cf. footnote on p. 198), could be derived as a
       consequence. However, the argument presented by Andrew Wiles as a proof of
       Fermat's assertion was not an argument independent of the Taiyama conjecture ­
       which it would have to have been had that conjecture been an '9t'-but an
       argument for proving the Taiyama conjecture itself!
                 The case for non-computability in mathematical thought                          137

could generate precisely all the II 1 -sentences that can be perceived as true by
human mathematicians.
   Of course, none of this tells us that such an F-Godel's putative 'theorem­
proving machine'-is an impossibility; but from the point of view of our
mathematical understandings, its existence seems very unlikely. In any case,
there is, at present, not the slightest suggestion as to the nature of a plausible
such F, nor is there any hint whatsoever of its existence. It could only be a
conjecture, at best-and an unprovable one at that. (Proving it would
contradict it! ) It seems to me that it would be rash in the extreme for any AI
supporter (whether d or PJ) to pin hopes on finding such an algorithmic
procedure, * as embodied by F, whose very existence is dubious in the extreme
and, in any case, if it were to exist its definite construction would be beyond the
wit of any of today's mathematicians or logicians.
   Is it conceivable such an F could exist nevertheless, and might actually be
arrived at by means of sufficiently elaborate bottom-up computational
procedures? In §3.5-§3.23, as part of the discussion of case III, I shall present a
strong logical argument showing that no knowable bottom-up procedures
could ever find such an F even if it did exist. We thus come to the conclusion
that even 'GOdel's theorem-proving machine' is not a serious logical
possibility unless there are 'unknowable mechanisms' underlying mathe­
matical understanding as a whole that are of a nature that would give no
comfort to AI proponents!
   Before turning to this more general discussion of case Ill, and of bottom-up
procedures in general, we must complete the arguments that are specific to
case II itself; for there still remains the alternative that the underlying
algorithmic action F-or formal system IF-might be unsound (a let-out that
did not apply to case I}. Might it be that human mathematical understanding
is equivalent to a knowable algorithm that is fundamentally erroneous? Let us
consider this possibility next.

  3 .4 Do mathematicians unwittingly use an unsound
                     algorithm?
Perhaps there is an inconsistent formal system IF that underlies our
mathematical understanding. How can we be sure that our mathematical
         * Of course, it might well be argued that the building of a robot mathematician is
      very far from the immediate aims of artificial intelligence; accordingly, the finding of
      such an F would be regarded as premature or unnecessary. However, this would be
      to miss the point of the present discussion. Those viewpoints which take human
      intelligence to be explicable in terms of algorithmic processes implicitly demand the
      potential presence of such an £-knowable or unknowable-because it is merely
      the application of intelligence that has led us to our conclusions. There is nothing
      special about mathematical abilities in this regard; see § 1 . 1 8 and § 1 . 19, in
      particular.
138            The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

perceptions as to what is unassailably true may not someday lead us
fundamentally astray? Perhaps they have even done so already. This is not quite
the same situation as we considered in relation to I, in which the possibility was
ruled out that we could know that some system IF actually played such a role.
Here we are allowing that this role for IF is unknowable, and so we must
reconsider that IF might actually be an unsound system. But is it really plausible
that our unassailable mathematical beliefs might rest on an unsound system­
so unsound, indeed, that '1 = 2' is in principle part ofthose beliefs? Surely, if our
mathematical reasoning cannot be trusted, then none of our reasoning about the
workings of the world can be trusted. For mathematical reasoning forms an
essential part of all of our scientific understanding.
   Some will argue, nevertheless, that it is surely not inconceivable that our
accepted mathematical reasoning (or what we may come to accept in the
future as 'unassailable') contains some hidden inbuilt contradiction. Such
people will be likely to refer to the famous paradox (about "the set of sets that
are not members of themselves") that Bertrand Russell pointed out in a letter
to Gottlob Frege, in 1902,just as Frege was about to publish his life's work on
the foundations of mathematics (see also response to Q9, §2.7, and ENM, p.
 100). Frege added, in an appendix (cf. Frege 1964; translated):

      Hardly anything more unwelcome can befall a scientific writer than that
      one of the foundations of his edifice be shaken after the work is finished. I
      have been placed in this position by a letter from Mr Bertrand
      Russell . . .

   Of course, we could simply say that Frege made a mistake. It is admitted
that mathematicians do make mistakes from time to time-sometimes serious
ones. Moreover, Frege's error was a correctable mistake, as Frege's own
admission makes clear. Have I not argued (in §2. 10, cf. commentary on Q13)
that such correctable mistakes are not our concern? As in §2. 10, we are indeed
concerned only with matters of principle and not with the fallibility of
individual mathematicians. Surely errors that can be pointed out and
demonstrated as errors are not the sort of thing that should concern us?
However, the situation is somewhat different here, from that which was
addressed in relation to Q13, since we are now concerned with a formal system
IF that we do not know underlies mathematical understanding. As before, we
are not concerned with individual mistakes-or 'slips'-that a mathematician
might happen to make while reasoning within a consistent overall scheme. But
we are now addressing a situation in which the scheme itself might be subject
to an overall contradiction. This is just what happened in Frege's case. Had
Russell's paradox, or another paradox of a similar nature, not been pointed
out to Frege, then, as seems likely, he surely would not have been persuaded
that his scheme contained any fundamental error. It was not a matter of
Russell pointing out some technical slip in Frege's reasoning which Frege
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought              1 39

would have admitted was an error according to his own canons of reasoning; it
was that those very canons were shown to contain an inbuilt contradiction. It
was this contradiction that persuaded Frege that there was an error-and what
might previously have seemed to Frege to be unassailable reasoning was now
seen to be fundamentally flawed. But the flaw was perceived only because the
contradiction itself was brought to light. Without the contradiction having
been perceived, the methods of reasoning might well have been trusted and
perhaps followed by mathematicians for a good long while.
   In fact I should say that, in this case, it is hardly likely that many
mathematicians would have, for long, allowed themselves the freedom of
reasoning (with infinite sets) that Frege's scheme permitted. But this is because
paradoxes of the Russell type would all too easily have come to light. One
might imagine some much more subtle paradox, even lying implicit in what we
believe to be unassailable mathematical procedures that we allow ourselves
today-a paradox which might not come to light for centuries to come. Only
when such a paradox finally manifests itself would we feel the necessity to
change our rules. The argument would be that our mathematical insights are
governed not by timeless considerations, but that these insights are shifting
things strongly influenced by what seems to have worked well so far and on
what, in effect, 'we can get away with'. On this view, it would be allowed that
there might be an algorithm or formal system underlying present-day
mathematical understanding, but that this algorithm is not a fixed thing, being
continually subject to change, as new information comes to light. I shall need
to return to the issue of changing algorithms later on (cf. §3.9-§3. 1 1 , also §1 .5).
We shall see that such things are really just algorithms again, in another guise.
   It would, of course, be naive of me not to admit that there are often elements
of 'trusting a procedure if it seems to have worked so far' in the way that
mathematicians operate in practice. In my own mathematical reasoning, for
example, such slipshod or tentative practices constitute a definite ingredient of
mathematical thinking. But they tend to form part of what is important in
one's groping towards a previously unformed understanding, not a part of
what one takes to have been unassailably established. I feel doubtful that
Frege himself would have been completely dogmatic that his scheme must be
unassailable, even without Russell's paradox having been pointed out to him.
Such a general scheme of reasoning would always have to be put forward
somewhat tentatively in any case. It would take a good deal of further 'mulling
over' before it could be believed to have reached the 'unassailable' level. For a
scheme of the generality of Frege's, it seems to me, one would in any case be
driven to making statements of the form 'assuming Frege's scheme is sound,
then such-and-such', rather than merely asserting 'such-and-such' without
such qualification. (See comments on Qll, Q12.)
   Perhaps mathematicians have now become more cautious as to what they
are prepared to regard as 'unassailably true'-after a period of excessive
boldness (of which Frege's work indeed formed an important part) at the end
140           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

of the nineteenth century. Now that paradoxes such as Russell's have come to
light, the importance of such caution is made particularly manifest. The
boldness arose, to a large extent, when the power of Cantor's theory of infinite
numbers and infinite sets, that he had put forward in the late 1 800s, began to
become clear. (It should be said, however, that Cantor himself was well aware
of the problem of Russell-type paradoxes-long before Russell had come
across them4-and had tried to formulate a sophisticated point of view which
took such things very much into account.) For the purposes ofthe discussions
that I have been concerned with here, an extreme degree of caution is certainly
appropriate. I am happy that only those things whose truth is indeed
unassailable should be included in the discussion, and that anything
concerning infinite sets that is at all questionable should not be so included.
The essential point is that wherever the line is drawn, Godel's argument
produces statements that remain within the compass of what is indeed
unassailable (cf. commentary on Q13). Godel's (and Turing's) argument does
not, on its own, involve any issue of the questionable existence of certain
infinite sets. Doubtful issues in relation to the kind of very free reasoning that
Cantor, Frege, and Russell were concerned with need not concern us so long as
they remain 'doubtful' as opposed to 'unassailable'. This being accepted, I
cannot really see that it is plausible that mathematicians are really using an
unsound formal system IF as the basis of their mathematical understandings
and beliefs. I hope the reader will indeed agree with me that whether or not
such a consideration is possible, it is certainly not at all plausible.
    Finally, in relation to the possibility that our putative IF might be an
unsound system, we should briefly recall the other aspects of human
inaccuracy that were already discussed under Q12 and Q13 above. I should
first reiterate that we are here concerned not with the inspirations, guesses, and
heuristic criteria that may guide mathematicians towards their new mathe­
matical discoveries, but with the understandings and insights that provide
them with the basis of what they take to be their unassailable beliefs with
regard to mathematical truth. These beliefs can be the results of merely
following other people's arguments, and no elements of mathematical
discovery need be involved. In feeling one's way towards original discoveries,
it is indeed important to allow speculation to roam freely, unconstrained by an
initial need for total reliability and accuracy (and it is my impression that this
is what Turing was mainly concerned with in the quotation above, §3. 1 ). But
when it comes to the point of whether to accept or to reject arguments in
 support of a proposed mathematical statement being actually unassailably
true, it is necessary that we be concerned with mathematical understandings
 and insights-often aided by lengthy computation-that are free from error.
    This is not to say that mathematicians do not frequently make errors in
 believing that they have correctly applied their understandings when in fact
 they have not. Mathematicians certainly do make mistakes in their reasoning
 and in their understandings, as well as in their attendant computations. But
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought           141

their tendency to make such errors does not basically increase their power of
understanding (although I can imagine that an occasional flash of understand­
ing might come about by such fortuitous means). More importantly, these
errors are correctable; when such errors are pointed out, either by some other
mathematician or by the same mathematician at a later time, the errors are
recognizable as errors. It is not as though there is some inbuilt erroneous
formal system IF controlling the mathematician's understandings, since this
would be incapable of recognizing its own errors. (The possibility of having a
self-improving system that changes itself whenever it finds an inconsistency
would be included in the discussion leading up to §3. 14. Accordingly, we find
that this kind of proposal does not really help; cf. also §3.26.)
   A slightly different kind of error arises when a mathematical statement is
formulated incorrectly; the mathematician proposing the result might really
mean something a little different from what has literally been proposed. Again,
this is something correctable, and it is not the kind of inbuilt error that would
result from an unsound IF underlying all human insights. (Recall Feynman's
dictum, referred to in relation to Q13: 'Don't listen to what I say; listen to what
I mean!') All the time, we are concerned with what can in principle be
ascertained by a (human) mathematician, and, for this, errors of the type that
we have just been considering here-i.e. correctable errors-are not relevant.
Most importantly for this entire discussion, it is the central idea of the
Godel-Turing arugment which has to be part of what a mathematician can
understand, and it is this which forces us to reject I and to regard II as
extremely implausible. As noted above, in the dicsussion under Q13, the idea
of the Godel-Turing argument certainly ought to be part of what a
mathematician can in principle understand, even though some specific
statement 'G(IF)' that the mathematician might happen to have settled upon
might be in error-for correctable reasons.
   There are other issues that need to be addressed, in relation to the possibility
that 'unsound' algorithms might underlie mathematical understanding. These
concern 'bottom-up' procedures, such as self-improving algorithms, learning
algorithms (including artificial neural networks), algorithms with additional
random ingredients, and algorithms whose actions depend upon the external
environment in which the algorithmic devices are placed. Some of these issues
have been touched upon earlier (cf. commentary under Q2) and they will be
addressed at length as part of our discussion of case m, that we must come to
next.


          3 . 5 Can an algorithm be unknowable?
According to III, mathematical understanding would be the result of some
unknowable algorithm. What does it actually mean for an algorithm to be
'unknowable'? In the previous sections in this chapter, we have been
142            The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

concerned with matters of principle. Thus, an assertion that the unassailable
truth of some n 1 -sentence is accessible to human mathematical understanding
would be an assertion that this n 1 -sentence is in principle accessible, not that
any human mathematician need necessarily actually ever encounter a
demonstration of it, But for an algorithm to be unknowable, a somewhat
different interpretation of the term 'unknowable' is needed. Here I shall mean
that the algorithm is something whose very specification is beyond what can
be achieved in practice.
   When we were concerned with derivations within a specific knowable
formal system, or with what is achievable by use of some known algorithm,
then it was indeed appropriate that we should have been concerned with what
can or cannot be achieved in principle. The issue is whether or not some
particular proposition can be derived from such a formal system or algorithm
was necessarily taken in an 'in principle' sense. We can compare this situation
with that of the truth of.ll csentences. A ll 1 -sentence is, after all, taken to be
true if it represents a Turing-machine action that does not terminate in
principle, irrespective of what might be possible to achieve in practice by direct
computation. (This is in accordance with the discussion of Q8.) Likewise, an
assertion that some specific proposition is, or is not, derivable within some
formal system must be taken in the 'in principle' sense, such an assertion being
itself of the form of an assertion that some particular n 1 -sentence is false or
true, respectively (cf. end of discussion of QlO). Accordingly, when we are
concerned with derivability within some fixed formal set of rules, 'knowability'
will always be taken in this 'in principle' sense.
   On the other hand, when we are concerned with the issue of whether the
rules themselves might be 'knowable', this must be taken in the 'in practice'
sense. Any formal system, Turing machine, or ll csentence can be specified in
principle, so the issue of'unknowability' here must, if it is to have any meaning,
be concerned with what can or cannot be accessed in practice. Any algorithm
whatever is, indeed, in principle knowable-in the sense that the Turing­
machine action that effects that algorithm is 'known' as soon as the natural
number that codes that action is known (e.g. in terms of the specification of
Turing-machine numbers as given in ENM). There is no real suggestion that a
natural number could be unknowable in principle. Natural numbers (and thus
algorithmic actions) can be listed 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . , and thus any specific
natural number will eventually be encountered-in principle-no matter how
large that number might be ! In practice, however, there will be numbers that
are so large that there is no prospect of their ever being encountered in this
way. For example, the number of the universal Turing machine given in ENM,
p. 56, is far too large for it to be encountered in such an enumeration in
practice. Even if the digits could be produced one after the other in as small a
time interval as is theoretically definable (the Planck timescale of about
0.5 x 10- 4 3 seconds-cf. §6. 1 1 ), then no number whose binary representation
has more than about 203 digits would have been encountered, as yet, in the
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought           143

entire time-span of the universe starting from the big bang. The number just
referred to has over 20 times as many digits as this-yet this in itself does not
stop it from being 'knowable' in practice, this number being presented in ENM
explicitly.
   For a natural number or Turing-machine action to be 'unknowable' in
practice, we must imagine that even the very specification of that number, or
action, would be so complicated that it lies beyond human abilities. This
perhaps seems a tall order, but one might argue from the finiteness of human
beings, that there must at least be some limit that puts certain numbers beyond
human specification. (See the related discussion in response to Q8. ) We must
imagine that, in accordance with III, it is the vast complication of all the
minute details of the specification of the algorithm F being supposed to
underlie mathematical understanding that puts it beyond human knowabil­
ity-in the sense of specifiability, as opposed to its being knowably the
algorithm we are supposed actually to use. It is this requirement of non­
specifiability that separates III from II. Thus, in our consideration of III, we
must entertain the possibility that it would be beyond human capabilities even
to specify the number in question, let alone to know that that number has the
qualities that are required of it as a number that determines the algorithmic
action underlying human mathematical understanding.
   It should be made clear that mere size cannot be the limiting factor . It is very
easy to specify numbers that are so large that they exceed the sizes of numbers
that might be needed to specify algorithmic actions of relevance to the
behaviour of any organism in the observable universe (e.g. the easily specified
number 2265 5 3 6, that featured in the response to Q8, vastly exceeds the number
of possible different universe states for all the material that lies within our
observable universe 5 ). It would have to be the precise specification of the
number required, not its mere size, that would be beyond human capabilities.
   Let us suppose that, in accordance with III, the specification of such an F is
indeed beyond human capabilities. What would this tell us about the prospect
of a fully successful AI strategy (according to either 'strong' or 'weak' AI-the
respective viewpoint of d or PA)? It would be anticipated by believers in
computer-controlled AI systems (certainly under viewpoint d, and perhaps
also under .?4) that the robot creations that can eventually arise as a result of
this strategy should be able to attain and perhaps surpass human mathe­
matical capabilities. Consequently, it would have to be the case, if we accept
III, that some such humanly unspecifiable algorithm Fwould form part of the
control system of such a mathematical robot. This would seem to imply that
an AI strategy of such eventual scope is unattainable. For if it needs an
unspecifiable F in order to achieve its aims, there would be no prospect of
human beings ever setting it in action.
   But this is not the picture presented by the most ambitious of AI supporters.
They might envisage that the needed F would not arise immediately, but
would be built up in stages, where the robots themselves would gradually
144            The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

improve their performances through their (bottom-up) learning experiences.
Moreover, the most advanced robots would not be the direct creations of
human beings, but would more likely have been created by other robots 6 ,
perhaps somewhat more primitive than the required mathematical robots;
and there could also be some kind of Darwinian evolution in operation,
serving to improve the capabilities of the robots from generation to .
generation. Indeed, it would be argued that it was through processes of this
general kind that we ourselves were able to acquire, as ingredients of our own
'neural computers', some humanly unknowable algorithm F controlling our
own mathematical understandings.
   In the next several sections, I shall be arguing that processes of this nature do
not really escape the problem: if the very procedures whereby an AI strategy
would be set up in the first place are algorithmic and knowable, then any such
resulting F should also be knowable. In this way, case m will be reduced either
to I or to ll, the cases that were n.lled out; in §3.2-§3.4, as �ing effectively
impossible (case I), or at least highly implausible (case ll). In fact, it is really case
I that we shall find ourselves driven to, on the assumption that such underlying
algorithmic procedures are knowable. Accordingly, case m (and, by implica­
tion, case ll also) will be itself rendered effectively untenable.
   Any reader who pins faith in the possibility ofm as providing a likely route
to a computational model of the mind will do well to pay these arguments their
due attention and follow them through with great care. The conclusion will be
that iflll is indeed to be taken as providing the basis for our own mathematical
understandings, then the only plausible way that our own F could have arisen
would have been by divine intervention-basically the Jilj!!) possibility
mentioned at the end of § 1 .3-and this would clearly be no consolation to
those concerned with the more ambitious long-term aims of computer-driven
AI !


            3 .6 Natural selection or an act of God?
But perhaps we should seriously consider the possibility that our intelligence
might indeed require some kind of act of God-and that it cannot be explained
in terms of that science which has become so successful in the description of the
inanimate world. Certainly we should continue to maintain an open mind; but
I should make it clear that in the discussions which follow, I am holding to a
scientific viewpoint. I shall address the possibility that our mathematical
understandings might result from some unfathomable algorithm-and the
question of how such an algorithm might actually have arisen-entirely in
such scientific terms. Possibly there are some readers who are inclined to
believe that such an algorithm could indeed si�ply have been implanted into
our brains according to some divine act of God. To such a suggestion I can
offer no decisive refutation; but if one ,chooses to abandon the methods of
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought          145

science at some point, it is unclear to me why it would be regarded as
reasonable to choose that particular point! If scientific explanation is to be
abandoned, would it not be more appropriate to free the soul altogether from
algorithmic action, rather than hiding its supposed free will in the
complication and unfathomability of an algorithm that is presumed to control
its every action? Indeed, it might seem more reasonable simply to adopt the
view, as appears to have been held by Godel himself, that the mind's action is
something beyond the action of the physical brain-which is in line with
viewpoint !!). On the other hand, I imagine that, nowadays, even those who
hold that in some sense our mentality is indeed a divine gift might nevertheless
tend to take the view that our behaviour can be understood within the scope of
scientific possibility. No doubt these cases are arguable-but I do not propose
to argue against !!) at this point. I hope that those readers who hold to some
form of viewpoint !!) will continue to bear with me, and try to see what the
scientific argument can do for us.
   What, then, are the scientific implications of an assumption that
mathematical conclusions are arrived at by the result of some necessarily
unfathomable algorithmic action? Roughly, the picture would have to be that
the exceptionally complicated algorithmic procedures that are needed for
simulating genuine mathematical comprehension have resulted from a good
many hundreds of thousands of years (at least) of natural selection, together
with several thousands of years of educational tradition and input from the
physical environment. The inherited aspects of these procedures would
presumably have gradually built themselves up from simpler (earlier)
algorithmic ingredients, as a result of the same kinds of selective pressures that
have produced all the other superbly effective bits of machinery that constitute
our bodies as well as our brains. The inbuilt potential mathematical
algorithms (i.e. whatever inherited aspects to our mathematical thinking­
presumed algorithmic-that there might be) would somehow lie coded within
the DNA, as particular features of its sequences of amino acids, and they
would have arisen as a result of that same procedure whereby improvements
gradually or intermittently arisein response to selective pressures. In addition,
there would be external influences of various kinds, such as direct
mathematical education, and experience coming from our physical environ­
ment, as well as other factors providing as additional purely random input. We
must try to discover whether such a picture can be seen as at all plausible.


                    3 .7 One algorithm or many?
One important issue that we must address is the possibility that there might be
numerous quite different, perhaps inequivalent, algorithms that are respon­
sible for the different modes of mathematical understanding that pertain to
different individuals. Indeed, one thing is certainly clear from the start, and
146           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

that is that even amongst practising mathematicians, different individuals
often perceive mathematics in quite different ways from one another. To some,
visual images are supremely important, whereas to others, it might be precise
logical structure, subtle conceptual argument, or perhaps detailed analytic
reasoning, or plain algebraic manipulation. In connection with this, it is worth
remarking that, for example, geometrical and analytical thinking are believed
to take place largely on opposite sides-right and left, respectively-of the
brain 7 • Yet the same mathematical truth may often be perceived in either of
these ways. On the algorithmic view, it might seem, at first, that there should
be a profound inequivalence between the different mathematical algorithms
that each individual might possess. But, despite the very differing images that
different mathematicians (or other people) may form in order to understand or
to communicate mathematical ideas, a very striking fact about mathematic­
ians' perceptions is that when they finally settle upon what they believe to be
unassailably true, mathematicians will not disagree, except in such circum­
stances when a disagreement can be traced to an actual recognizable
(correctable) error in one or the other's reasoning-or possibly to their having
differences with respect to a very small number offundamental issues; cf. Q l l ,
particularly �***. For convenience of description, here, I shall ignore this
latter issue in the following discussion. Although it does have some relevance,
it does not substantially affect the conclusions. (Having just a very small
number of inequivalent possible viewpoints does not, for the purposes of my
argument, substantially differ from having just one.)
   The perceiving of mathematical truth can be achieved in very many different
ways. There can be little doubt that whatever detailed physical activity it is
that takes place when a person perceives the truth of some mathematical
statement, this physical activity must differ very substantially from individual
to individual, even though they are perceiving precisely the same mathe­
matical truth. Thus, if mathematicians just use computational algorithms to
form their unassailable mathematical truth judgements, these very algorithms
are likely to differ in their detailed construction, from individual to individual.
Yet, in some clear sense, the algorithms would have to be equivalent to one
another.
   This may not be such an unreasonable thing as it may seem at first, at least
from the point of view of what is mathematically possible. Very different­
looking Turing machines can have identical outputs. (For example, consider
the Turing machine constructed as follows: when acting on the natural
number n, it outputs 0 whenever n is expressible as the sum of four square
numbers, and it outputs 1 whenever n is not so expressible. This machine's
output is identical to that of another machine, constructed simply to output 0
whatever number n it acts on-because it happens to be the case that every
natural number is the sum offour squares; see §2.3.) Two algorithms need not
be at all similar with regard to their internal operations and yet they can be
identical as to their eventual external effects. However, in a certain sense, this
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought            14 7

actually makes it more puzzling how our putative unfathomable algorithm(s)
for ascertaining mathematical truth might have arisen, for now we need many
such algorithms, all quite distinct from one another in their detailed
constructions, yet all essentially equivalent as regards their outputs.


         3 . 8 Natural selection of unworldly esoteric
                               mathematicians
What about the role of natural selection? Is it possible that there is some
algorithm F (or perhaps several such) controlling all our mathematical
understandings, which is unknowable (according to III--or at least whose
role is unknowable (according to II)? Let me start by reiterating a point that
was made at the beginning of §3 . 1 . Mathematicians do not think that they are
just following a set of unknowable rules-rules so involved they are
mathematically unfathomable in principle-when they come to what they
regard as their unassailable mathematical conclusions. They believe that these
conclusions are, on the contrary, the result of arguments, albeit often long and
tortuous, that rest ultimately on clear unassailable truths that could be
appreciated, in principle, by anybody.
   In fact, at the level of common-sense or logical descriptions, what they
believe they are doing is indeed what they are doing. This should not be
genuinely doubted; it is a point that cannot be emphasized too strongly. lfit is
to be maintained that mathematicians are following a set of unknowable or
unfathomable computational rules, in accordance with III or II, then this has
to be something they they are also doing-concurrently with what they think
they are doing, but at a different level of description. Somehow, their
algorithmic following of these rules would have to have the same effects that
mathematical understandings and insights lead to-at least in practice. What
we have to try to believe, if we adhere to either of the viewpoints d or !14, is that
this possibility is a genuinely plausible one.
   We must bear in mind what these algorithms must achieve for us. They must
provide their possessors with the capabilities-in principle at least-for
correctly following ma�hematical reasoning about abstract entities very far
removed from direct experience and, for the most part, leading to no
discernible practical advantages for the individuals possessing them. Anyone
who has had occasion to glance at any modern pure-mathematical research
journal will realize how very far from anything directly practical are the main
concerns of mathematicians. The details of the arguments that tend to be
presented in such research papers would not be immediately comprehensible
to any but a tiny minority of people; yet the reasonings would ultimately be
things built up from small steps, where each small step could in principle be
understood by any thinking person, even though it might concern abstract
reasoning about complicatedly defined infinite sets. We must presume that it is
148            The case for non-computability in mathematical thought




      Fig. 3 . 1 . For our remote ancestors, a specific ability to do sophisticated
      mathematics can hardly have been a selective advantage, but a general
                           ability to understand could well have.


the nature of some DNA sequence that provides an algorithm-or perhaps
one of a large number of alternative, though mathematically equivalent, such
algorithms-which must be adequate for giving people the potentiality for
following such reasoning. If we believe that this is so, then we must seriously
ask ourselves how on earth such an algorithm or algorithms could possibly
have arisen by natural selection. It seems clear that, today, there is no selective
advantage in being a mathematician. (I suspect that it might even be a
disadvantage. Mathematically inclined purists have a tendency to end up in
poorly paid academic jobs-or sometimes without any job at all-as a result
of their curious passions and predilections !) Much more to the point is the fact
that there can have been no selective advantage to our remote ancestors for an
ability to reason about very abstractly defined infinite sets, and infinite sets of
infinite sets, etc. Those ancestors were concerned with the practical matters of
the day; perhaps such things as the construction of shelters or clothing or the
design of mammoth traps--or, later, the domestication of animals and the
raising of crops. (See Fig. 3 . 1 .)
   It would be very reasonable to suppose that the selective advantages that
our ancestors enjoyed were qualities that were valuable for all these things
and, as an incidental feature, turned out, much later, to be just what was
needed for the carrying out of mathematical reasoning. This, indeed, is more
or less what I believe myself. According to a view of this kind, it might be the
general quality of being able to understand that Man has somehow acquired,
or developed to a high degree, through the pressures of natural selection. This
ability to understand things would have been non-specific, and it would have
applied to Man's advantage in many ways. The building of shelters or
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought          149

mammoth traps, for example, would merely be specific instances where Man's
ability to understand things generally would have been invaluable. Nonethe­
less, in my own opinion, an ability to understand would be a quality by no
means unique to Homo sapiens. lt might also have been present in many of the
other animals with whom Man was in competition, but to a lesser degree, so
that Man, by virtue of an increased development of an ability to understand,
would have obtained a very considerable selective advantage over them.
   The difficulty with such a viewpoint arises only if we try to imagine that an
inherited faculty for understanding might be something algorithmic. For we
have seen, by the arguments that have gone before, that any faculty for
understanding that is strong enough that its possessor is capable of
appreciating mathematical arguments, and in particular the Godelian
argument in the form that I have given it, must, if algorithmic, be an action
that is so complicated or obscure that it (or its role) is unknowable by the very
possessor of that faculty. Our naturally selected putative algorithm would
have to have been strong enough that, at the time of our remote ancestors, it
would already have encompassed, within its potential scope, the rules of any
formal system that is now considered by mathematicians to be unassailably
consistent (or unassailably sound, with regard to Il csentences, cf §2. 10, in
response to QlO). This almost certainly would include the rules of the
Zermelo-Fraenkel formal system ZIF, or perhaps its extension to the system
ZIFC (which is ZIF, to which the axiom of choice has been adjoined}-the
systems (cf. §3.3 and §2. 10, response to QlO) that many mathematicians
would now regard as providing all of the methods of reasoning needed for
ordinary mathematics-and any of the particular formal systems which can be
obtained by applying the Godelization procedure to Z IF any number of times,
and any of the other formal systems that could be arrived at by use of insights
that are accessible to mathematicians, say by virtue of the understanding that
such Godelization will continue to yield unassailably sound systems, or other
types of unassailable reasoning of an even more powerful nature. The
algorithm would have to have encompassed, as particular instances of itself,
the potential for making precise discriminations, distinguishing valid from
invalid arguments in all the, then, yet-to-be-discovered areas of mathematical
activity that nowadays occupy the pages of mathematical research journals.
This putative, unknowable, or incomprehensible algorithm would have to
have, coded within itself, a power to do all this, yet we are being asked to
believe that it arose solely by a natural selection geared to the circumstances in
which our remote ancestors struggled for survival. A particular ability to do
obscure mathematics can have had no direct selective advantage for its
possessor, and I would argue that there can be no reason for such an algorithm
to have arisen.
   The situation is quite different once we allow 'understanding' to be a non­
algorithmic quality. Then, it need not be something so complicated that is is
unknowable or incomprehensible. Indeed, it could be much closer to 'what
1 50             The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

mathematicians think they are doing'. Understanding has the appearance of
being a simple and common-sense quality. It is something difficult to define in
any clear-cut way, but nevertheless it is so familiar to us that it seems hard for
us to accept that it might be a quality that cannot be properly simulated even
in principle, by a computational procedure. Yet, this is indeed what I am
contending. On the computational view, one needs an algorithmic action that
allows for any eventuality, so that the answers to all mathematical questions
that it is ever likely to be confronted with are, in a sense, preprogrammed into
the algorithm. If they are not directly preprogrammed, then some computa­
tional means for finding a way to the answers is needed. As we have seen, these
'preprogrammings' or 'computational means' must, if they are to encompass
all that can be achieved by human understanding, themselves be something
beyond human comprehension. How could the blind processes of natural
selection, geared only to promote the survival of our remote ancestors, have
been able to 'foresee' that such-and-such an unknowably sound computation­
al procedure would be able to resolve obscure mathematical issues that had no
relevance whatsoever to those survival issues?



                      3 .9 Learning algorithms
Lest the reader be tempted too quickly to agree that such a possibility is
absurd, I should make clearer the picture that holders of the computational
view might be inclined to present. As already indicated in §3.5, they would not
so much envisage an algorithm that had, in a sense, been 'preprogrammed' to
provide the answers to mathematical problems, but rather some computation­
al system that would have a capacity to learn. They might envisage something
that would have significant 'bottom-up' ingredients in conjunction with
whatever 'top-down' procedures might be needed (cf. §1 .5). *
   Some might feel that the description 'top-down' is not really appropriate at
all for a system that has arisen solely through the blind processes of natural
selection. What I would mean here by that term would be those aspects of our
putative algorithmic procedure which are genetically fixed within the
organism and are not subject to alteration by the subsequent experiences and
learning of each individual. Though the top-down aspects would not have
been designed by anything with actual 'knowledge' of what they would

         *There is now a fairly well-defined mathematical theory of learning; see Anthony
       and Biggs ( 1 992 ). However, this theory is concerned more with issues of complexity
       rather than computability - i.e. with questions as to the speed or of storage space
       needed, for obtaining solutions to problems; cf. ENM, pp. 140-5 . There is no
       suggestion that such mathematically defined learning systems could simulate the
       way that human mathematicians arrive at their notions of 'unassailable truth'.
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought          151

ultimately achieve-as the relevant DNA sequences finally get translated into
the appropriate brain action-they might, nevertheless, provide clear-cut
rules within which the mathematically active brain would perform. These top­
down procedures would provide those algorithmic actions that constitute
whatever fixed framework might be needed, within which the more flexible
(bottom-up) 'learning procedures' would be allowed to operate.
   We must now ask: what is the nature of these learning procedures? We
imagine that our learning system is placed in an external environment, where
the way in which the system acts in this environment is being continually
modified by how its environment has reacted to its earlier actions. There are
basically two factors involved. The external factor is the way in which this
environment behaves and how it reacts to the system's actions. The internal
one is how the system itself then modifies its own behaviour in response to
these changes in its environment. We shall examine the algorithmic nature of
the external factor first. Is it possible that the external environment's reaction
can supply a non-algorithmic ingredient even if the internal construction of
our learning system is entirely algorithmic?
   In some circumstances, such as is often the case with the 'training' of
artificial neural networks, the reaction of the external environment might be
provided by the behaviour of an experimenter or trainer or teacher-let us just
say 'teacher'-whose intention is deliberately to improve the performance of
the system. When the system performs in a way that is desired by the teacher,
then this fact is signalled to the system so that, in accordance with its internal
mechanisms for modifying its own behaviour, it becomes more likely to
perform, in the future, in the way desired by the teacher. For example, one
might have an artificial neural network that is being trained to recognize
human faces. The system's performance is continually monitored, and the
accuracy of its 'guesses' is fed back into the system at each stage so that it is
enabled to improve its performance by appropriately modifying its internal
structure. In practice, the results of these guesses need not be monitored by the
human teacher at every stage, since the training procedure could also be
largely automated. But in this kind of situation, the human teacher's goals and
judgements form the ultimate criterion of performance. In other types of
situation, the external environment's reaction need not be something as
'deliberate' as this. For example, in the case of a developing living system-but
still envisaged as operating according to some type of neural network scheme
(or other algorithmic procedures, e.g. genetic algorithms, cf. §3.7) like those
that have been put forward in computational models-there need be no such
external goals or judgements. Instead, the living system might modify its
behaviour in a way that can be understood in terms of natural selection, acting
according to criteria that had evolved over a great many years, and which
would serve to enhance its own survival prospects, and the survival of its
progeny.
1 52           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought


 3 . 1 0 May the environment provide a non-algorithmic
                                external factor?
We are here envisaging that the system itself (whether living or not) might be
some kind of computer-controlled robot, so that its procedures for self­
modification are entirely computational. (I am using the term 'robot' here
merely to emphasize that our system is to be viewed as an entirely
computational entity in interaction with its environment. I do not mean to
imply that it is a mechanical device that has been deliberately constructed by
human beings. It could, itself, be a developing human being, in accordance
with d or &I , or else it could indeed be an artificially constructed object.) Thus,
we are assuming here that the internal factor is entirely computational. We
must ask whether or not the external factor supplied by the environment is
something computational-that is, we must address the question of whether it
is possible to give an effective computational simulation of that environment,
in both the artificial case-when it is artificially controlled by a human
teacher-or the natural case, where it is the forces of natural selection that
provide the arbiter. In each case the particular internal rules, according to
which the robot learning system modifies its behaviour, would have to be
geared to respond to the particular ways in which the environment signals to
the system how the quality of its previous performance is to be judged.
    The question of whether the environment can be simulated in the artificial
case, i.e. whether an actual human teacher can be simulated computationally,
is simply the entire question that we are considering all over again. On the
hypotheses d or &I , whose implications we are now exploring, it is assumed
that it is the case that an effective simulation is, in principle, indeed possible. It
is the overall plausibility of this assumption that is being explored, after all.
Thus, along with the assumption that our 'robot' system is computational, we
have a computational environment also. Therefore, the entire combined
system, consisting of the robot together with its teacher environment, would
be something that could, in principle, be effectively simulated computation­
ally, so the environment would offer no loophole that might enable a
computational robot to behave in a non-computational way.
    Sometimes people try to argue that it is the fact that humans form a
community, with continual communication amongst its members, that gives us
our advantage over computers. According to this view, humans could
individually be regarded as computational systems, but the human com­
munity would give something more. The argument could be applied, in
particular, to the mathematical community, as compared with individual
mathematicians-so the community might act in a non-computational way,
whereas individual mathematicians would not. I find it difficult, myself, to
make sense of this argument. For one could equally well consider a
community of computers, which are in continual communication with one
another. Such a 'community' would again form a computational system as a
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought           153

whole; the action of the entire community could, if desired, be simulated on a
single computer. Of course, the community would, for a larger number of
individuals, constitute an immensely larger computational system than would
its individual members, but this does not give us a difference in principle. It is
true that our planet contains over 5 x 109 human inhabitants (not to mention
its vast libraries of stored knowledge). But this is a mere matter of numbers,
and on the computational view, the development of computers could
accommodate the increases involved in passing from individual to community
in perhaps a few decades if needed. It seems clear that, in the artificial case,
where the external environment consists of human teachers, we get nothing
new in principle, and this provides no explanation of how a non­
computational entity might arise out of entirely computational constituents.
   What about the natural case? The question now is whether the physical
environment, quite apart from the actions of human teachers within it, might
contain ingredients that cannot, even in principle, be simulated computation­
ally. It seems to me that if one believes that there is something that is in
principle impossible to simulate in a human-free environment, then one has
already conceded the main case against CC. For the only clear reason for
doubting that CC could be a serious possibility lies in a scepticism that the
actions of objects in the physical world could act in a non-computational way.
Once it is conceded that some physical action might be non-computational,
the possibility is laid open for non-computational actions also in the physical
brain, and the main case against CC is indeed conceded. In a general way,
however, it would seem most unlikely that there is something in the non­
human environment that more profoundly eludes computaton than there is in
a human being. (Compare also § 1 .9 and §2.6, Q2.) I think that few would
seriously contend that there is anything that would be of relevance to the
environment of a learning robot that in principle lies beyond computation.
   In referring to the 'in principle' computational nature of the environment,
however, I should address an important point. There is no doubt that the
actual environment of any developing living organism (or sophisticated robot
system) would depend upon incredibly complicated factors, and that any
tolerably precise simulation of that environment might well be out of the
question. Even with relatively simple physical systems, the dynamical
behaviour can be exceedingly complex, and can depend so critically upon the
minute details of the initial state, that there is no question of computationally
predicting its subsequent behaviour-the example of long-range weather
prediction being an example of this nature that is frequently cited. Such
systems are referred to a chaotic; cf. §1 .7. (Chaotic systems have elaborate and
effectively unpredictable behaviour. These systems are not mathematically
incomprehensible, however; they are very actively studied as an important
part of current mathematical research. 8 ) As was stated in § 1 . 7, chaotic systems
are included in what I am calling 'computational' (or 'algorithmic'). The
essential point about chaotic systems, for our purposes here, is that it is not
1 54           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

necessary for one to be able to simulate any actual chaotic environment, but a
typical environment would do equally well. For this, for example, we do not
need to know the weather; any plausible weather would do !


                      3 . 1 1 How can a robot learn?
Let us accept, then, that the issue of the computational simulation of the
environment is not our real concern. We shall, in principle, be able to do a
good enough job with the environment provided that there is no obstruction to
simulating the internal rules of the robot system itself. So let us address the
question of how our robot is to learn. What learning procedures are indeed
available to a computational robot? It might have preassigned clear-cut rules
of a computational nature, as would indeed be the case with the kind of
artificial neural network systems that are normally adopted (cf. §1 .5).
According to these systems, there would be a well-defined system of
computational rules whereby the connections between the artificial 'neurons'
that constitute the network would be strengthened or weakened so as to
improve its overall performance in accordance with the (artificial or natural)
criteria that have been determined by the external environment. Another type
oflearning system is provided by what is known as a 'genetic algorithm', where
there is some kind of natural selection between different algorithmic
procedures going on inside the machine, where the most effective algorithm for
controlling the system arises by a form of 'survival of the fittest'.
   It should be made clear that, as is usual with such bottom-up organization,
these rules would be different from the standard top-down computational
algorithms that act according to known procedures for giving precise
solutions to mathematical problems. Instead, these bottom-up rules would
simply be things which guide our system, in a general way, towards improving
its performance. However, the rules would still be entirely algorithmic-in the
sense that they can be enacted on a general-purpose computer (Turing
machine).
   In addition to clear-cut rules of this kind, there might be random elements
incorporated into the way that our robot system is to modify its performance.
It would be possible for these random ingredients to be introduced in some
physical way, perhaps by relying on some quantum-mechanical process such
as decay times of radioactive atomic nuclei. In practice, what tends to be done
in artificially constructed computational devices is to use some computational
procedure in which the outcome of the computation is in effect random-and
referred to as pseudo-random-even though it is really completely determined
by the result of a deterministic computation (cf. §1 .9). Another closely related
procedure would be to use the precise time at which the 'random' quantity is
called upon, and then to incorporate this time into a complicated computation
that is, in effect, a chaotic system, so that very tiny changes in the time will give
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought           155

outputs that are effectively unpredictably different and effectively random.
While, strictly speaking, random ingredients take us outside what is described
as 'Turing-machine action', they do not usefully do so. A pseudo-random
input in the workings of the robot would, in practice, be equivalent to a
random one; and a pseudo-random input does not take us outside what a
Turing machine can do.
   The reader may worry, at this point, that although a random input is in
practice no different from a pseudo-random one, there is a difference in
principle. As part of our earlier discussion-d. particularly §3.2-§3.4--we
were indeed concerned with what can be achieved in principle, rather than in
practice, by human mathematicians. In fact, there are certain types of
mathematical situation in which an actually random input provides a solution
of a problem where, technically speaking, no pseudo-random input could
achieve this. Such situations occur where the problem involves a 'competitive'
element, such as in game theory or cryptography. For certain types of 'two­
person game', the optimal strategy for each player involves an entirely random
ingredient. 9 Any consistent deviation, on the part of one of the players, from
the randomness that is needed for the optimal strategy would, over a
sufficiently long sequence of games, allow the other player-at least in
principle-to obtain an advantage. This advantage would occur if, in any way,
the opponent were able to form some significant guess as to the nature of the
pseudo-random (or other) ingredient that the first player was employing in
place of the required randomness. A similar situation occurs in cryptography,
where the security of some code would depend upon employment of a truly
randomly generated sequence of digits. If it were not actually generated
randomly, but by the use of some pseudo-random process, then, again, there is
the potentiality that the detailed nature of this pseudo-random process might
become known to someone attempting to break the code-a knowledge that
would be invaluable to the codebreaker.
   At first sight, it might appear that since randomness is invaluable in such
competitive situations, it would be a quality that might be favoured in natural
selection. Indeed, I feel sure that it is an important factor in the development of
organisms in many respects. However, as we shall be seeing later in this
chapter, mere randomness does not enable us to escape from the Godelian net.
Even genuinely random ingredients can be treated as part of the arguments
that follow, and they do not allow us to evade the constraints that bind
computational systems. In fact, there is actually a little more scope in the case
of pseudo-random processes than there is for random ones (cf. §3.22).
   For the moment, let us assume that our robot system is indeed, in effect, a
Turing machine (though with a finite storage capacity). More correctly, since
the robot is continually interacting with its environment and we are envisaging
that its environment can also be simulated computationally, it is the robot
together with the environment that we should be taking to act as a single
Turing machine. However, it will be helpful to consider the robot separately as
1 56           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

essentially a Turing machine itself, and to regard the environment as providing
information on the machine's input tape. In fact this analogy is not quite
appropriate as it stands, for the technical reason that a Turing machine is a
fixed thing which is not supposed to change its structure with 'experience'. One
might try to imagine that the Turing machine could change its structure by
continuing to run all the time, modifying this structure as it runs, where the
information from the environment is continually fed into the machine on its
input tape. However, this will not do, because the output of a Turing machine
is not supposed to be examined until the machine reaches its internal
command STOP (see §2. 1 and Appendix A; also ENM, Chapter 2), at which
point it is not supposed to examine any more of its input tape unless it starts all
 over again. For a subsequent running of the machine, it would have to revert
to its original state, so it could not 'learn' this way.
    However, it is easy to remedy this difficulty, by the following technical
device. We take our Turing machine to be indeed fixed, but after each reading
 of its tape it outputs two things (coded, technically, as a single number) when it
finally reaches STOP. The first thing codes what its external behaviour is
 actually to be, whilst the second is for its own internal use, coding all the
experience that it has obtained from previous encounters, with the external
environment. On its next run, it reads this 'internal' information first on its
input tape, before it reads, as a second part of its input tape, all the 'external'
information that its environment is now providing it with, including the
detailed reaction that the environment has had to the machine's earlier
 behaviour. Thus, all its learning is encoded in this internal part of its tape, and
 it keeps feeding this part of the tape (which would have a tendency to get
 longer as time progresses) back into itself.


  3 . 1 2 Can a robot attain 'firm mathematical beliefs' ?
In this way, we can indeed describe the most general computational learning
'robot' as a Turing machine. Now, our robot is supposed to be able to form
mathematical truth judgements, with all the potential capabilities of a human
mathematician. How would it go about doing this? We do not want to have to
encode, in some entirely 'top-down' way, all the mathematical rules (such as all
those involved in the formal system ZIF and far beyond it, as discussed above)
that would be needed for it to be able to encompass directly the mathematical
insights that are available to mathematicians since, as we have seen, there is no
reasonable way (short of 'divine intervention'-cf. §3.5, §3.6) that such a
vastly complicated, unknowably effective top-down algorithm could be
implemented. We must assume that whatever inbuilt 'top-down' elements
there are, they are not specific to the carrying out of sophisticated
mathematics, but are general rules that might be imagined as providing a basis
for the quality of 'understanding'.
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought              1 57

   Recall the two types of input from the environment, as considered above (cf.
§3.9), that might significantly influence the behaviour of our robot: the
artificial and the natural. With regard to the artificial aspects of the
environment, we imagine a teacher (or teachers) who tells the robot about
various mathematical truths and tries to guide it towards its obtaining an
internal way of distinguishing truths from falsehoods for itself. The teacher can
inform the robot when it has made an error, or tell it about various
mathematical concepts and different acceptable methods of mathematical
proof. The specific procedures adopted by the teacher could come from a
range of possibilities, e.g. teaching by 'example', by 'guidance', by 'instructing',
or even by 'spanking'! As for the natural aspects of the physical environment,
these could provide the robot with 'ideas' coming from the behaviour of the
physical objects; the environment could also provide concrete realizations of
mathematical concepts, such as different instances of the natural numbers: two
oranges, seven bananas, four apples, zero shoes, one sock, etc.-and with
good approximations to geometrical ideas like straight lines and circles, and
also approximations to certain concepts of infinite sets Oike the set of points
inside a circle).
   Since our robot is not preprogrammed in a completely top-down way, and it
is supposed to arrive at its concepts of mathematical truth by means of its
learning procedures, we must indeed allow that it will make mistakes as part of
its learning activities--so that it can learn by its mistakes. At least at first, these
mistakes could be corrected by its teachers. The robot might sometimes, as an
alternative, observe from its physical environment that some of its earlier
suggestions for mathematical truths must actually be errors, or are likely to be
errors. Or it might come to this conclusion entirely from internal consider­
ations of consistency, etc. The idea would be, however, that the robot makes
fewer and fewer mistakes as its experience grows. As time progresses, the
teachers and the physical environment may become less and less essential to
the robot-and perhaps eventually become irrelevant altogether-for the
forming of its mathematical judgements, and it could rely more and more on
its internal computational power. Accordingly, so it would be supposed, our
robot could reach beyond these specific mathematical truths that it had learnt
from its teachers or inferred from its physical environment. One could thus
imagine that it might even eventually make original contributions to
mathematical research.
   In order to examine the plausibility of all this, we shall need to relate it to
what we have been discussing earlier. If our robot is really to have the
capabilities, understandings, and insights of a human mathematician, it will
require some kind of concept of 'unassailable mathematical truth'. Its earlier
attempts, which would have been corrected by its teachers or rendered
implausible by its physical environment, would not come into this category.
Those would belong to the category of 'guesses', where such guesses would be
exploratory and permitted to be in error. If our robot is to behave like a
1 58          The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

genuine mathematician, although it will still make mistakes from time to time,
these mistakes will be correctable-and correctable, in principle, according to
its own internal criteria of 'unassailable truth'.
   We have seen, by the above discussion, that a human mathematician's
concept of'unassailable truth' cannot be attained by any (humanly) knowable
and completely believable set of mechanical rules. If we are supposing that our
robot is to be capable of attaining (or surpassing) the level of mathematical
capability that a human being is in principle capable of achieving, then its
concept of unassailable mathematical truth must also be something that
cannot be attained by any set of mechanical rules that can in principle be
perceived as sound-perceived as sound, that is, by a human mathematician
or, for that matter, by our robot mathematician!
   A question of importance in these considerations, therefore, is whose
concepts, perceptions, or unassailable beliefs are to be of relevance-o urs or
the robots? Can a robot be considered actually to have perceptions or beliefs?
The reader, if a follower of viewpoint PA, might have difficulty with this, since
the very concepts of 'perception' and 'belief' are mental attributes and would
be regarded as inapplicable to an entirely computer-controlled robot.
However, in the above discussion, it is not really necessary that the robot
actually possesses genuine mental qualities, provided that it is assumed
possible for the robot to behave externally just as a human mathematician
could, as would be implied by a strict adherence to PA, just as well as to d.
Thus, it is not necessary that the robot actually understand, perceive, or
believe anything, provided that in its external pronouncements it behaves
precisely as though it does possess these mental attributes. This point will be
elaborated further in §3.17.
   Viewpoint PA does not in principle differ from d with regard to limitations
on the ways in which a robot might be able to behave, but holders of viewpoint
PA might well have smaller expectations with regard to what a robot might be
likely actually to achieve, or of the likelihood of finding a computational
system that could be regarded as being able to provide an effective simulation
of the brain of a person who is in the process of perceiving the validity of a
mathematical argument. Such a human perception would involve some
understanding of the meanings of the mathematical concepts involved.
According to viewpoint d, there is nothing lying beyond some feature of a
computation that can be involved in the very notion of 'meaning', whereas
according to PA, meanings are semantic aspects of mentality and are different
from anything that can be described in purely computational terms. In
accordance with PA, we do not expect that our robot can achieve an
appreciation of any actual semantics. Thus, PA-supporters may be less likely
than d-supporters to expect that any robot, constructed according to the
principles that we have been considering, could actually achieve the external
manifestations of human understanding that a human mathematician is
capable of. I imagine that this suggests (not unnaturally) that PA-supporters
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought         1 59

would be easier to convert to <6'-supporters than d-supporters would be; but,
from the point of view of what needs to be established for our arguments here,
the differences between viewpoints d and £!1 are not significant.
   The upshot of all this is that although our robot's mathematical assertions,
being controlled by a largely bottom-up system of computational procedures,
are initially exploratory and of a provisional nature as regards their truth, we
are to assume that the robot indeed also possesses a more secure level of
unassailable mathematical 'belief', so that some of its assertions-attested by
some special imprimatur, which I denote here by a symbol '-tJ:', say-are to be
unassailable, according to the robot's own criteria. The question of whether
the robot is allowed to make errors with regard to its assignations of '*'­
albeit correctable by the robot itself-will be addressed in §3.19. For the
moment, it will be assumed that as soon as the robot does make a -tJ:-assertion,
it is to be taken that this assertion is indeed error free.


       3 . 1 3 Mechanisms underlying robot mathematics
Now let us consider all the various mechanisms which enter into the
procedures governing the behaviour ofthe robot, so that it finally arrives at its
"tJ:-assertions. Some of these would be internal to the robot itself. There would
be some top-down internal constraints inbuilt into the way in which the robot
operates. There would also be some predetermined bottom-up procedures
whereby the robot improves its performance (so that it can work its way
gradually up to the -tJ:-level). These would normally all be considered to be
things that are in principle humanly knowable (even though the final
implications of all the various factors together could well be beyond the
computational abilities of a human mathematician). Indeed, if it is being
proposed that human beings will someday be able to construct a robot capable
of doing genuine mathematics, then it would have to be the case that the
internal mechanisms according to which the robot is actually constructed are
humanly knowable; for otherwise the attempt to construct such a robot would
be a lost cause!
     Of course, we must allow that its construction might be a many-stage
process: that is, the construction of our mathematics-performing robot might
be carried out.entirely by 'lower-order' robots (themselves not being actually
capable of doing genuine mathematics), and those robots might perhaps have
been also built by robots of even lower order still. However, the entire
hierarchy would itself have to have been set in train by human beings, and the
rules for starting the hierarchy off (presumably some mixture of top-down and
bottom-up procedures) would have to have been humanly knowable.
     We must also include, as essential ingredients of the development of the
robot, all the various external factors coming from its environment. There
could indeed be a considerable input from the environment, both in the form
1 60           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

of human (or robot) teachers and the natural physical environment. As for the
'natural' external factors provided by the non-human environment, one would
not normally take these inputs to be 'unknowable'. They might well be very
complicated in detail, and frequently interactive, but already there are effective
'virtual reality' simulations of significant aspects of our environment (cf.
§1 .20). There seems to be no reason why these simulations should not be
extended to provide all that our robot would need for its development, in the
way of external natural factors-bearing in mind (cf. §1 .7, §1 .9) that all that
needs to be simulated is a typical environment, not necessarily any actual
environment.
   Human (or robot) intervention-the 'artificial' external factors-could take
place at various stages, but this makes no difference to the essential
knowability of the underlying mechanisms, provided we assume that human
intervention is something that could also be knowably mechanized. Is this
assumption fair? I feel sure that it would be natural-at least for supporters of
d or .?4-to assume that any human intervention in the development of the
robot could indeed be replaced by an entirely computational one. We are not
asking that this intervention be something essentially mysterious-say some
kind of indefinable 'essence' that the human teacher might convey to the robot
as part of its education. We expect merely that there might be certain types of
basic information that need to be conveyed to the robot and which might most
easily be achieved by an actual human being. Very likely, such as when a
human pupil is being addressed, the conveying of information could be best
achieved in an interactive fashion, where the teacher's behaviour would itself
be dependent upon the way that the pupil reacts. But this, in itself, is no bar to
the teacher's role being an effectively computational one. The entire discussion
in this chapter is, after all, of the nature of a reductio ad absurdum, where we are
assuming that there is nothing essentially non-computational in a human
being's behaviour. For those holding to viewpoints Cf1 or �. who might be
better disposed towards believing in the possibility of some kind of non­
computational 'essence' conveyed to the robot by virtue of its teacher's actual
humanity, this entire discussion is, in any case, unnecessary!
   Taking all these mechanisms together (these consisting of internal
computational procedures and input from the interactive external environ­
ment), it does not appear to be reasonable to take them to be unknowable,
even though some people might well take the position that the detailed
resulting implications of these external mechanisms could not be humanly
calculable-or perhaps not even calculable, in practice, by any existing or
foreseeable computer. I shall come back again shortly to this issue of the
knowability of all these computational mechanisms (cf. end of §3. 1 5). But, for
now, let us assume that the mechanisms are indeed knowable-let us call this
set of mechanisms M. Is it possible that some of the *-level assertions that
these mechanisms lead to might still not be humanly knowable? Is this a
consistent point of view? It is not really, if we continue to interpret 'knowable',
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought             161

in this context, in the 'in principle' sense that we adopted in connection with
cases I and n, and which was explicitly enunciated at the beginning of §3.5.
The fact that something (e.g. the formulation of some *-assertion) might lie
beyond the unaided computational powers of a human being is not what is of
relevance here. Moreover, we should have no objection to allowing a human's
thought processes to be aided by pencil and paper, or by a hand calculator, or
even by a top-down programmed general-purpose computer. The including of
bottom-up ingredients to the computational procedures adds nothing new to
what can in principle be achieved-provided that the basic mechanisms
involved in these bottom-up procedures are humanly understandable. On the
other hand, the issue of the 'knowability' of the mechanisms M themselves
must be taken in the 'in practice' sense, as is consistent with the terminology
that was made explicit in §3.5. Thus we are, for the moment, supposing the
mechanisms M to be indeed actually knowable in practice.
   Knowing the mechanisms M, we can take them to constitute the basis for
the construction of a formal system Q(M), where the theorems of Q (M) would
be: (i) the *-assertions that actually arise from the implementation of these
mechanisms; and (ii) any proposition that can be obtained from these *­
assertions by use of the laws of elementary logic. By 'elementary logic' would
be meant, say, the rules of predicate calculus-in accordance with the
discussion of §2.9-or any other such straightforward and clear-cut
unassailable system of similar (computational) logical rules. We can indeed
construct such a formal system Q(M) by virtue of the fact that it is a
computational procedure Q(M) (albeit a lengthy one, in practice) to obtain
these *-assertions, one after the other, from M. Note that Q(M), as so defined,
generates the assertions in (i) above, but not necessarily all of those in (ii) (since
we may assume that our robot might get very bored simply generating all the
logical implications of the *-theorems that it produces!). Thus, Q(M) is not
precisely equivalent to Q(M), but the difference is not important. Of course,
we could also extend the computational procedure Q(M) to obtain another
one which is equivalent to Q(M), if desired.
   Now, for the interpretation of the formal system Q(M), it needs to be clear
that, as the robot develops, the imprimatur '*' actually does mean-and will
continue to mean-that the thing that is being asserted is indeed to be taken as
unassailably established. Without input from the human teachers (in some
form) we cannot be sure that the robot will not develop for itself some different
language in which '*' has some entirely other meaning, if it has any meaning at
all. To ensure that the robot's language is consistent with our own
specifications in the definition of Q(M), we must make sure that, as part of the
robot's training (say, by the human teacher), the meaning that is to be attached
to '*' is indeed what we intend it to be. Likewise, we must make sure that the
actual notation that the robot uses in order to specify, say, its Ilcsentences is
the same as (or explicitly translatable into) the notation that we use ourselves.
If the mechanisms M are humanly knowable, it follows that the axioms and
1 62           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

rules of procedure of the formal system Q(M) must also be knowable.
Moreover, any theorem obtainable within Q(M) would count as, in principle,
humanly knowable (in the sense that its specification is humanly knowable,
not necessarily its truth), even though the computational procedures for
obtaining many such theorems might well lie beyond unaided human
computational powers.




                    3 . 1 4 The basic contradiction
What the foregoing discussion has achieved, in effect, is to show that the
'unknowable unconscious algorithm F, that lll assumes underlies the very
perception of mathematical truth, can be reduced to a consciously knowable
one-provided that, in accordance with the aims of AI, it should be possible to
set in train some system of procedures which ultimately result in the
construction of a robot capable of doing human-level mathematics (or
beyond). The unknowable algorithm F is thereby replaced by a knowable
formal system Q(M).
      Before examining this argument in detail, I should call attention to a
significant issue which I have not yet properly addressed, namely the
possibility that there might be random elements introduced at various stages in
the development of the robots, rather than having just a fixed set of
mechanisms. This issue will need some attention in due course, but for the
moment, I am simply considering that any such random element is regarded as
being effected by some pseudo random (chaotic) computation. As was argued
                                -



earlier, in § 1 .9 and §3. 1 1 , such pseudo-random ingredients ought, in practice,
to be adequate. I shall return to the issue of random inputs in §3.18, where a
more complete discussion of genuine randomness will be given, but for now,
when I refer to 'the mechanisms M', I shall assume that they are indeed entirely
computational and free from actual uncertaihty.
      The central idea for our contradiction is, roughly, that Q(M) should indeed
take the place of the 'F' of our earlier discussion, particularly that given in §3.2
in connection with case I. Accordingly case Ill is effectively reduced to I and is
thereby effectively ruled out. We are assuming-in accordance with viewpoint
d or gj, for the purposes of argument-that, in principle, our robot could, by
means of learning procedures of the nature of those that we have laid down,
eventually achieve any mathematical result that a human could achieve. We
must allow that it might also achieve results that are in principle beyond human
powers. In any case, the robot would have to be able to appreciate the force of
the Godel argument (or be at least able to simulate this appreciation, in
accordance with gj). Thus, for any given (sufficiently extensive) formal system
n-!1 , the robot would have to be able to perceive, unassailably, the fact that the
                The case for non-computability in mathematical thought                       163

soundness of o-n implies the truth of its Godel proposition * Q(D-fl ), and also that
it implies that Q(D-fl ) is not a theorem of o-n . In particular, the robot would
perceive that the truth ofQ(Q(M)) follows unassailably from the soundness of
Q(M), and so also does the fact that Q(Q(M)) is not a theorem of Q (M).
   Exactly as for case I (as was argued for humans in §3.2), it immediately
follows from this that the robot is incapable of firmly believing that the formal
system Q(M) is equivalent to its own notion of unassailable mathematical
belief. This is despite the fact that we (that is, the appropriate AI experts) might
well know that the mechanisms M do underlie the robot's mathematical belief
system, and hence that its unassailable belief system is equivalent to Q(M).
For if the robot did firmly believe that its beliefs were encapsulated by Q(M),
then it would have to believe in the soundness of Q(M). Consequently it would
have also to believe Q(Q(M)), together with the fact that Q(Q(M)) lies outside
its belief system-which is a contradiction! Thus the robot is incapable of
knowing that it was constructed according to the mechanisms M. Since we are
aware-or at least can be made aware-that the robot was so constructed, this
seems to tell us that we have access to mathematical truths, e.g. Q(Q(M)), that
are beyond the robot's capabilities, despite the fact that the robot's abilities are
supposed to be the equal of (or in excess of) human capabilities.


   3 . 1 5 Ways that the contradiction might be averted
We can take this argument in two different ways. We can look at it from the
standpoint of the human creators of the robot, or else from the robot's point of
view. From the human vantage point, there is the possible uncertainty that the
robot's claims to unassailable truth might be unconvincing to a human
mathematician, unless the actual individual arguments that the robot uses can
be appreciated by the human mathematician. The theorems of Q(M) might
not all be accepted as unassailable by the human-and we recall that the
robot's reasoning powers might actually be beyond human capabilities. Thus,
one might argue that the mere knowledge that the robot was constructed
according to the mechanisms M might not count as an unassailable (human)
mathematical demonstration. Accordingly, we shall take the whole argument
as being presented, instead, from the robot's point of view. Let us see what
loopholes there might be in the argument that the robot could perceive.
   There appear to be just four basic possibilities available to the robot for
circumventing this contradiction-assuming that it accepts that it is some
kind of computational robot.
(a) Perhaps the robot, whilst accepting that M might well underlie its own

        *For the discussions in the remainder of this chapter I shall take the Godel
      proposition essentially in its original form Q(IF}, stating the w-consistency of the
      formal system IF; cf. §2.8.
1 64          The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

    construction, would nevertheless necessarily remain unable to be
    unassailably convinced of this fact.
(b) Perhaps the robot, whilst being unassailably convinced of each individual
    *-assertion at the time it makes it, might nevertheless have doubts that the
    entire system of *-assertions can be trusted-accordingly, the robot might
    remain unconvinced that IQ(M) actually does entirely underlie its belief
    system with regard to llcsentences.
(c) Perhaps the true mechanisms M depend essentially on random elements
    and cannot be adequately described in terms of some known pseudo­
    random computational input.
(d) Perhaps the true mechanisms M are actually not knowable.
   The aim of the next nine sections will be to present careful arguments to
show that none of the loopholes (a), (b), and (c) can provide a plausible way to
evade the contradiction for the robot. Accordingly, it, and we also, are driven
to the unpalatable (d), if we are still insistent that mathematical understanding
can be reduced to computation. I am sure that those concerned with artificial
intelligence would find (d) to be as unpalatable as I find it to be. It provides
perhaps a conceivable standpoint-essentially the .91/!:0 suggestion, referred
to at the end of §1 .3, whereby divine intervention is required for the implanting
of an unknowable algorithm into each of our computer brains (by 'the best
programmer in the business'). In any case, the conclusion 'unknowable'-for
the very mechanisms that are ultimately responsible for our intelligence­
would not be a very happy conclusion for those hoping actually to construct a
genuinely artificially intelligent robot! It would not be a particularly happy
conclusion, either, for those of us who hope to understand, in principle and in
a scientific way, how human intelligence has actually arisen, in accordance
with comprehensible scientific laws, such as those of physics, chemistry,
biology, and natural selection-irrespective of any desire to reproduce such
intelligence in a robot device. In my own opinion, such a pessimistic
conclusion is not warranted, for the very reason that 'scientific comprehensibi­
lity' is a very different thing from 'computability'. The conclusion should be
not that the underlying laws are incomprehensible, but that they are non­
computable. I shall have more to say on this matter later, in Part II of this
book.

         3 . 1 6 Does the robot need to believe in M?
Let us imagine that we are presenting the robot with a possible set of
mechanisms M-which might in fact be those which underlie its construction,
but which need not actually be. I shall try to convince the reader that the robot
would have to reject the possibility that M actually could underlie its
mathematical understanding irre spe ctive of whether or not it actually does!
                              -



This is assuming, for the moment, that the robot is rejecting possibilities (b),
                The case for non-computability in mathematical thought                        165

(c), and (d), so we shall conclude, somewhat surprisingly, that (a) cannot, just
by itself, allow us to escape from the paradox.
   The reasoning is as follows. Let .A be the hypothesis:
      'the mechanisms M underlie the robot's mathematical understanding'.
Now consider assertions of the form:
      'such-and-such a Il csentence is a consequence of .A'.
I shall call such an assertion, if firmly believed by the robot, a '*..,-assertion'.
Thus, the "fl..,-assertions do not necessarily refer to Il csentences that are
unassailably believed by the robot just in themselves, but they are
II 1 -sentences that the robot accepts are unassailable deductions from the
hypothesis .A. The robot need not initially have any view whatsoever about
the likelihood that it was actually constructed according to M. It might even
initially be of the opinion that this is an unlikely possibility, but nevertheless it
could perfectly well contemplate-in true scientific tradition-what are the
unassailable consequences of the hypothesis that it was so constructed.
   Are there any Ilcsentences which the robot must regard as unassailable
consequences of .A, yet which are not simply ordinary "fl-assertions which do
not need the use of .A? Indeed there are. For, as was noted at the end of §3.14,
the truth of the II 1 -sentence Q(Q(M)) follows from the soundness of Q(M),
and so also does the fact that Q(Q(M)) is not a theorem of Q(M). Moreover,
the robot would be unassailably convinced of this implication. Assuming that
the robot is happy with the fact that its unassailable beliefs would be
encapsulated by Q(M) ifit were �onstructed according to M-i.e. that it rejects
possibility (b ) *-then it must indeed firmly believe that the soundness of
C(M) is a consequence of .A. Thus, the robot would be unassailably
convinced that the Ilcsentence Q(Q(M)) follows from the hypothesis .A, but
also (assuming .A) that it is not directly something that it can unassailably
perceive without using .A (because it does not belong to C(M)). Accordingly,
Q(Q(M)) is a *..,-assertion but not a "fl-assertion.
   Now let the formal system O..,(M) be constructed in exactly the same way as
Q(M), except now it is the *..,-assertions that take over the role that the
*-assertions played in the construction of Q(M). That is to say, the theorems
of O..,(M) are either (i) the "fl..,-assertions themselves, or (ii) the propositions
ootained from these "fl..,-assertions by use of elementary logic (cf. §3. 1 3). In the
same way that, on the hypothesis .A, the robot is happy that C(M)
encapsulates its unassailable beliefs with regard to the truth of ii 1 -sentences,
the robot should be equally happy that the system O..,(M) encapsulates its

        *Of course, possibility (d) is not at issue here, since the robot is actually being
      presented with M, and for the moment we are taking M to be free of genuinely
      random elements, so (c) is not under consideration either.
1 66           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

unassailable beliefs concerning the truth of 11 1 -sentences that are conditional
on the hypothesis .H.
   Next, let the robot contemplate the Godel 11 1 -sentence Q(O.u (M)). The
robot would certainly be unassailably convinced that this 11 1 -sentence is a
consequence of the soundness of O.u(M). It would also believe, unassailably,
that the soundness of O.u(M) is a consequence of .A, since it is happy that
O.u(M) does encapsulate what it unassailably believes concerning its ability to
derive 11 1 -sentences on the basis of the hypothesis .H. {It would argue as
follows. 'If I accept .11 , then I accept all the 11 1 -sentences that generate the
system O.u(M). Thus I must accept that O.u(M) is sound, on the basis of this
assumption .H. Consequently, I must accept that Q(O.u(M)) is true, on this
basis .A'.)
   But, believing (unassailably) tha:t the Godel 11 1 -sentence Q(O.u(M)) is a
consequence of .11 , it would have to believe that O(O.u (M)) is a theorem of
O.u(M). This it can only believe if it believes that O.u(M) is unsound-a firm
contradiction to its acceptance of .A!
   It has been implicitly assumed, in some of the above reasoning, that the
robot's unassailable belief is actually sound-although really what is required
is that the robot believes that its belief system is sound. In any case, the robot is
supposed to have at least human-level mathematical understanding; and, as
we argued in §3.4, human mathematical understanding ought to be sound, in
principle.
   There may seem to be a certain vagueness about the assumption .11 and in
the definition of a *.u-assertion. However, it should be stressed that such an
assertion, being a 11 1 -sentence, is a perfectly well-defined mathematical
statement. One might imagine that most of the *.u-assertions that a robot
might make would actually be ordinary *-assertions, since it is unlikely, in
any given case, that the robot would find it useful actually to invoke the
hypothesis .H. An exception would indeed be the O(Q(M)) that was referred to
above, since here Q(M) is playing, for the robot, the role of Godel's putative
'theorem-proving machine' of §3. 1 and §3.3. Being presented with .A, the
robot has access to its own 'theorem-proving machine', and although it might
not (and indeed could not) be unassailably convinced of the soundness of this
'machine', the robot might well contemplate that it might be sound, and to try
to deduce the consequences of this hypothesis.
    So far, this would get the robot no closer to paradox than GOdel was able to
achieve for humans, according to his quote given in §3. 1 . However, since the
robot can contemplate the putative mechanisms M, and not merely the
particular formal system Q(M), it can repeat the reasoning and go beyond
Q(M) to O.u(M), whose soundness it would still regard as simply a
consequence of the hypothesis .H. It is this that leads it to (the required)
contradiction. (See also §3.24 for further discussion of the system O.u (M) and
its apparent relationship with 'paradoxical reasoning'.)
    The upshot is that no mathematically aware conscious being-that is, no
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought             1 67

being that is capable of genuine mathematical understanding-can operate
according to any set of mechanisms that it is able to appreciate, irrespective of
whether it actually knows that those mechanisms are supposed to be the ones
governing its own routes to unassailable mathematical truth. (We recall, also,
that its 'unassailable mathematical truth' just means what it can mathematic­
ally establish-which means by means of 'mathematical proof' though not
necessarily 'formal' proof.)
   More precisely, we are driven, by the foregoing reasoning, to conclude that
there is no robot-knowable set of computational mechanisms, free of
genuinely random ingredients, that the robot could accept as being even a
possibility for underlying its mathematical belief system-provided that the
robot is prepared to accept that the specific procedure that I have been
suggesting for constructing the formal system Q(M) from the mechanisms M
actually does encapsulate the totality of Ilcsentences that it believes in
unassailably-and, correspondingly, that the formal system Q.K(M) encapsu­
lates the totality of II 1 -sentences that it unassailably believes would follow
from the hypothesis Jt. Moreover, there is the further point that genuinely
random ingredients might have to be included into the mechanisms M if the
robot is to achieve a potentially consistent mathematical belief system.
   These remaining loopholes are things that I shall have to address in the next
several sections (§3.17-§3.22). It will be convenient to discuss the issue of
incorporating possible random ingredients into the mechanisms M (possi­
bility (c)) as part of the general discussion of (b). In order to address the issue of
(b) more carefully, we must first reconsider the whole question of robot 'belief',
which was addressed briefly at the end of §3.12.


            3 . 1 7 Robot errors and robot 'meanings' ?
The central question that we must next address is whether the robot is
prepared, unassailably, to accept that if it is constructed according to some
set of mechanisms M, then the formal system Q(M) correctly encapsulates its
mathematical belief system with regard to Ilcsentences (and correspondingly
for Q.K(M)). For this, the most essential point is that the robot is prepared to
believe that Q(M) is sound-that is, it must believe that all the Il csentences
which are 'tr-assertions are actually true. For the arguments as I have phrased
them, it is also required that any Ilcsentence that the robot is capable of
unassailably believing in must actually be a theorem of Q(M) (so that Q(M)
could serve to define a 'theorem-proving machine' for the robot, analogous to
the putative suggestion of Godel's with regard to human mathematicians, cf.
§3. 1 , §3.3). In fact it is not essential that Q(M) actually have this universal role
with regard to the robot's potential abilities with regard to II 1 -sentences, but
only that it be broad enough to encompass the particular use of the Godel
argument that allows it to be applied to the system Q(M) itself (and
1 68          The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

correspondingly to O..�(M)). We shall be seeing later that this is a fairly
clear-cut thing-and that it need only be applied to some finite system of
II 1 -sentences.
    Thus we-and the robot-must face the possibility that the robot's *­
assertions may actually sometimes be erroneous, even though correctable by
the robot itself, according to its own internal criteria. The idea would be that
the robot might behave very much in the way that a human mathematician
would behave. A human mathematician can certainly get into situations
where he or she believes that a certain II1-sentence has been unassailably
established as true (or perhaps as false)-whereas in fact there is an error in the
reasoning that the mathematician might perceive only later. At the later date
the earlier reasoning might clearly be perceived as being wrong, according to
the same criteria as those that had been adopted earlier, whereas the error was
not actually noticed earlier-and a II 1-sentence that had previously seemed to
be unassailably true might now be even seen to be false (or vice versa).
   The robot might indeed be expected to behave in a similar way, so that its *­
assertions can not actually be relied upon even though they have been given
the imprimatur '*' by the robot. Later on, the robot could correct its error, but
an error would have been made nevertheless. How does this affect our
conclusions concerning the soundness of the formal system Q(M)? Clearly,
Q(M) is not now altogether sound, nor 'perceived' as altogether sound by the
robot, so its GOdel proposition O(Q(M)) cannot be trusted. This is essentially
what is involved in the loophole (b).
    Let us reconsider the question of what it might mean for our robot to arrive
at 'unassailable' mathematical conclusions. We must compare the situation
with the one that we considered in the case of a human mathematician. There,
we were not concerned with what a mathematician might happen to claim in
practice, but with what in principle would be taken to be an unassailable truth.
We should also recall Feynman's dictum: 'Don't listen to what I say; listen to
what I mean'. It seems that we should be concerned with what our robot means
rather than, necessarily, what it says. But, especially if one holds to viewpoint
fJI, rather than to d, it is not clear how one is to interpret the very idea of the
robot meaning anything at all. If it were possible to rely, not on what the robot
*-asserts, but on what it actually 'means' or on what it in principle 'ought to
mean', then the problem of possible inaccuracy in its *-assertions would be
circumvented. The trouble is, however, that we seem to have no method of
externally accessing such 'meanings' or intended 'meanings'. As far as the
formal system O(M) is concerned, it appears that we must rely on the actual *­
assertions themselves, and we cannot be totally sure that these are
trustworthy.
    Do we perceive a possible operational distinction between the implications
of viewpoints d and fJI here? Perhaps so; for although d and fJI are equivalent
with regard to what can in principle be achieved externally by a physical
system, people holding these views might well tend to differ as to their
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought         1 69

expectations of what kind of computational system they might regard as likely
to be able to provide an effective simulation of the brain of a person who is in
the process of perceiving the validity of a mathematical argument (cf. end of
§3.12). However, such differences in expectation are not of particular concern
for the present argument.


  3 . 1 8 How to incorporate randomness--ensembles of
                              robot activity
In the absence of a direct operational route to these semantic issues, we must
rely on the actual *-assertions that our robot may make in accordance with
the mechanisms that control its behaviour. We have to accept that some of
these may be in error, but that such errors are correctable and, in any case,
extremely rare. It would be reasonable to suppose that whenever the robot
does make an error in one of its *-assertions, then this error can be attributed,
at least in part, to some chance factors in its environment or its internal
workings. If we imagine a second robot, operating according to just the same
type of mechanisms as the first one, but for which these factors are different,
then the second robot would not be likely to make those errors that the first
robot made-although it might make other errors. These chance factors might
be actual random ingredients that are either specified as part of the robot's
input from its external environment or else as part of the robot's internal
workings. Alternatively, they might be pseudo-random, either external or
internal, and the result of some deterministic but chaotic computation.
   For the purposes of the present argument I shall assume that any such
pseudo-random ingredient has no role to play other than that which would be
achieved, at least as effectively, by a genuinely random ingredient. This is
certainly the normal point of view. However, there does remain a possibility
that there might be something in the behaviour of chaotic systems-going
beyond their role as merely simulating randomness-that approximates some
useful kind of non-computational behaviour. I have never seen such a case
seriously argued, although some people have indeed put faith in chaotic
behaviour as a fundamental aspect of the activity of brains. For myself, such
arguments remain unpersuasive unless some essentially non-random (that is,
non-pseudo-random) behaviour of such chaotic systems can be demon­
strated-a behaviour that in some strong sense usefully approximates a
genuinely non-computational one. No hint of such a demonstration has yet
come to my attention. Moreover, as I shall be underlining later (§3.22), it is in
any case unlikely that chaotic behaviour can evade those difficulties that
Godel-type arguments present for computational models of the mind.
   Let us take it, for the moment, that any pseudo-random (or otherwise
chaotic) ingredients in our robot or its environment can be replaced by
genuinely random ones, without any loss of effectiveness. To discuss the role of
1 70          The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

genuine randomness, we must consider the ensemble of all possible
alternatives. Since we are supposing our robot to be digitally controlled, and
that, correspondingly, its environment can also be provided as some kind of
digital input (recall the 'internal' and 'external' part of our Turing machine's
tape, as described above; cf. also §1 .8) there will be a .finite number of such
possible alternatives. This number might be very large indeed, but it would
still be a computational matter to describe all of them together. Thus, the
entire ensemble of all possible robots, each acting according to the
mechanisms that we have laid down, will itself constitute a computational
system-although undoubtedly one that could not be enacted in practice by
any computer foreseeable at the present time. Nevertheless, despite the
unfeasibility of actually carrying out a combined simulation of all possible
robots acting according to the mechanisms M, the computation itself would
not be 'unknowable'; that is to say, one could see how to build a (theoretical)
computer--or Turing machine-that could carry out the simulation, even
though it would be out of the question actually to carry it out. This is a key
point in our discussion. A knowable mechanism or a knowable computation is
one that can be humanly specified; it need not result in a computation that
could be actually carried out by a human being, or even by any computer that
could be built in practice. The point is very similar to one that came up earlier,
in relation to Q8, and is consistent with the terminology introduced at the
beginning of §3.5.

         3 . 1 9 The removal of erroneous *-assertions
Let us now return to the question of (correctable) erroneous 'tr-assertions that
our robot might occasionally make. Suppose that our robot indeed makes
such an error. If we may assume that another robot, or the same robot at a
later time--o r another instance of the same robot-would not be likely to
make that same mistake, then we can, in principle, identify the fact that such a
'tr-assertion is an error by looking inside our ensemble of possible robot
actions. We can picture our simulation of all the different possible robot
behaviours being carried out in such a way that all the different instances of
our robot developing in time are viewed as taking place simultaneously. (This
is merely a convenient way of picturing thirlgs. It does not demand that our
simulation really acts according to some necessarily 'parallel' action. As we
have seen before, there is nothing that in principle distinguishes parallel from
serial action, considerations of computational efficiency apart; cf. §1 .5.) The
idea is that by examining the result of this simulation, it should be possible,
in principle, to weed out the (proportionally) small number of erroneous
'tr-assertions from amongst the multitude of correct -tr-assertions, by
taking advantage of the fact that the erroneous ones are 'correctable' and
would therefore be judged as errors by the vast majority of instances of our
robot in simulation-at least as the parallel 'experiences' of the different
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought           171

instances of our robot develop in (simulated) time. I am not asking that this be
a practical procedure, but merely that it be a computational one, where it is
seen that the rules M underlying this entire computation are things that are in
principle 'knowable'.
   In fact, in order to make our simulation closer to what would be appropriate
for the human mathematical community, and also to make doubly certain that
all errors in *-assertions are weeded out, let us consider that our robot's
environment can be broken down into a community of other robots together
with a non-robot (and non-human) residual environment-and we must allow
that there could be some teachers in addition to that residual environment, at
least in the initial stages of the robots' development, so that, in particular, the
strict meaning of the robots' use of the imprimatur '*' would be made clear to
the robots. All the alternative possible behaviours of all the robots, together
with all possible (relevant) residual environments and human input, all
varying with respect to different choices of the random parameters involved,
will take part as different instances within our simulated ensemble. Again the
rules-which I shall still label as M--ean be taken to be perfectly knowable
things, despite the outlandish complication of the detailed computations that
would have to take place if the simulation were to be actually enacted.
   We shall envisage taking note (in principle) of any Il csentences that are
*-asserted-or whose negations are *-asserted-by any of the various
instances of the (computationally simulated) robots. We are going to try to
single out such *-assertions that are error free. Now, we could demand that
any *-assertion about a II 1 -sentence is to be ignored unless, within a period of
time T to the past or future, the number r of different instances of this *­
assertion, in the ensemble of all the simultaneous simulations, satisfies
r > L + Ns , where L and N are some suitably large numbers, and where s is the
number of *-assertions, within the same time interval, that take the opposite
position with regard to the II 1 -sentence or simply claim that the reasoning
underlying the original *-assertion is erroneous. We could insist, if desired,
that the time period T (which need not be 'actual' simulated time, but
measured in some units of computational activity), as well as L and N, might
increase as the 'complication' of the Il 1 -sentence that is being *-asserted
increases.
   This notion of 'complication' for II 1 -sentences can be made precise in terms
of Turing-machine specifications, as was done in §2.6 (end of response to QS).
To be specific, we can use the explicit formulations given in ENM, Chapter 2,
as outlined in Appendix A of this book (p. 1 17). Thus, we take the degree of
complication of a Il csentence, asserting the non-stopping of the Turing­
machine computation Tm(n ), to be the number of p of binary digits in the larger
of m and n.
   The reason for including the number L in these considerations, rather than
merely settling for some overwhelming majority, as would be provided by the
large factor N, is that one must take into account the following kind of
1 72          The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

possibility. Suppose that very occasionally, within our ensemble of alterna­
tives, a 'mad' robot arises, that makes a completely ridiculous '*-assertion'
which it never reveals to any other of the robots-an assertion so absurd that it
never occurs to any of the other robots to refute it ! Such a *-assertion would
have counted as 'error free', according our criteria, without the inclusion of L.
But with a large enough L, this possibility would not occur, where we assume
that such robot 'madness' is an infrequent occurrence. (It may well be, of
course, that I have overlooked some other possibility of this kind, and some
other precautions are needed. But, for the moment at least, it seems reasonable
to proceed on the basis of the criteria that I have suggested above.)
   Bearing in mind that the *-assertions were already supposed to be
'unassailable' claims made by our robot-based upon seemingly clear-cut
logical reasoning available to the robot, where anything for which there was
perceived to be the slightest doubt was not to be included-it would seem to be
reasonable that the occasional slip in the robot's reasoning could indeed be
eliminated in this way, where the functions T(p ), L (p ), and N(p) need not be
anything out of the ordinary. Allowing that this is the case, we again have a
computational system-a system that is knowable (in the sense that the rules
underlying the system are knowable), assuming that the original mechanisms
M underlying our robot's behaviour are knowable. This computational
system provides us with a new (knowable) formal system IQ'(M), whose
theorems are now these error{ree *-assertions (or assertions obtainable from
these by the simple logical operations of predicate calculus).
   In fact, the important thing, for our purposes, is not so much that these
assertions are actually error free, but that they are believed to be error free by
the robots themselves (bearing in mind that for followers of viewpoint f!A, the
concept of the robot actually 'believing' anything must be taken in the purely
operational sense of it simulating such belief, cf. §3. 1 2, §3. 1 7).
   More precisely, what is required is that the robots must be prepared to
believe subject to the assumption that it is the mechanisms M that underlie
their behaviour-the hypothesis .A of §3.16-that these *-assertions are
indeed error free. Up to this point, in this section, I have been concerned with
the removal of possible errors in the robot's *-assertions. But what we are
really concerned with, for the basic contradiction presented in §3. 1 6, is the
removal of errors in *A-assertions, those IT 1 -sentences that the robots believe
 unassailably follow from .A. Since the robots' acceptance of the system IQ'(M)
is in any case conditional on .A, we may as well allow them also to
contemplate a broader formal system Q:.V(M), defined analogously to the
formal system IQ A(M) of §3. 16. Here, O:.V(M) denotes the formal system
 constructed from the *A-assertions which are validated as "error free"
 according to the T, L, N criterion given above. In particular, the assertion that
 Q(IQ:.V(M)) is true would be validated as an error-free *A-assertion. The same
 reasoning as that given in §3.16 tells us that the robots cannot accept that they
                The case for non-computability in mathematical thought                 1 73

were constructed according to M, no matter what computational rules M are
suggested to them !
   Is this sufficient for our contradiction? The reader may still have the uneasy
feeling that no matter how careful we have been, there may still be some
erroneous -.::..,((-assertions, or -.:.-assertions, that could slip through the net. It is,
after all, necessary for the above argument that we weed out absolutely all the
erroneous *.,((-assertions (or -.:.-assertions) concerning 11 1 -sentences. For us
(or the robots) to be absolutely sure that Q(Q�(M)) is true, the actual
soundness of the system O:U(M) (conditional on .d) is being called upon. This
soundness demands that absolutely no erroneous such *.,(( -assertions are
included-or are believed to be included. Despite our earlier caution, this may
still seem to us, and perhaps to the robots themselves, to fall short of
certainty-if only for the reason that the number of possible such assertions is
infinite.

           3 .20 Only finitely many *At-assertions need be
                                    considered
However, it is possible to eliminate this particular problem and restrict
attention to a finite set of different *.,((-assertions. The arguments are
somewhat technical, but the basic idea is that we only need consider
11 1 -sentences whose specifications are 'short' in a certain well-defined sense.
The specific degree of 'shortness' that is needed depends upon how
complicated the specification of the system of mechanisms M needs to be. The
more complicated the specification of M is, the 'longer' the II 1 -sentences have
to be allowed to be. This 'maximum length' is given in terms of a certain
number c, which can be determined from the degree of complication of the
rules defining the formal system O:U(M). The idea is that when we pass to the
Godel proposition of this formal system-which we shall actually have to
modify slightly-we get something that is not much more complicated than
this modified system is complicated itself. In this way, with the exercise of some
care in the choice of c, we can make sure that this GOdel proposition is itself
'short'. This enables us to achieve the required contradiction without going
outside the finite set of 'short' 11 1 -sentences.
      We shall see how to achieve this in a bit more detail in the remainder of this
section. Those readers who are not interested in such detail-and I am sure
there are many-would be well advised to skip all this material !
      We shall need to modify our formal system O:U(M) to a slightly different
system ID:U(M,c)--which for simplicity's sake, I shall just denote by Q (c)
(dropping most of those confusing appendages-which have now got quite
out of hand!). The system Q(c) is defined in the following way: the only
-.::..,((-assertions that will now be allowed to be accepted as 'error free', in the
construction of Q(c ), will be those whose degree of complication, as described
1 74            The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

by the number p as above, is less than c, where c is some suitably chosen
number that I shall have something more to say about in a moment. I shall
 refer to these 'error free' *A-assertions for which p < c as Jshort *A­
 assertions. As before, the actual theorems of Q(c) will not be precisely the
 J short *A-assertions, but would also include assertions obtainable from the
 Jshort *A-assertions by standard logical operations (of, say, predicate
 calculus). Although the theorems of Q(c) will be infinite in number, they will be
 generated, by use of ordinary logical operations, from this .finite set of J short
 *A-assertions. Now, since we are restricting attention to this finite set, we may
 as well assume that the functions T, L, and N are constant (say, the maximum
 values over the finite range of p). Thus, the formal system Q(c) will depend
 only upon the four fixed numbers c, T, L, and N, and on the general system of
 mechanisms M that underlie the robot's behaviour.
    Now, the essential point of this discussion is that the Godel procedure is a
.fixed thing, which requires only some definite amount of complication. The
 GOdel proposition O(IHI ) for a formal system IHI is a II 1 -sentence whose degree
 of complication need only be greater than the complication involved in IHI itself
 by a relatively small amount that can be specified precisely.
    In order to be more specific about this, I shall adopt a slight abuse of
 notation, and use the expression 'O(IHI)' in a particular way which may not
 precisely coincide with the notation of §2.8. We are interested in IHI only in its
 capacity to prove II 1 -sentences. In accordance with this capacity, IHI will
 supply us with an algebraic procedure A which is capable of ascertaining-as
 signalled by A's action terminating-precisely the II 1 -sentences that can be
 established using the rules of IHI . A Ilcsentence is .an assertion of the form 'the
 Turing-machine action T11(q) does not terminate'-where we can now use the
 specific Turing-machine codings of Appendix A (i.e. of ENM, Chapter 2). We
 think of A as acting on the pair (p,q), as in §2.5. Thus A(p,q) itself is to
 terminate if and only ifiHI is capable of establishing that particular II 1 -sentence
 which asserts: 'T,.(q) does not terminate'. The procedure of §2.5 now provides
 us with a specific computation (denoted 'Ck(k)' in §2.5) which, on the
 assumption of the soundness of IHI , provides us with a true II 1 -sentence which
 is beyond the capabilities of IHI . This is the Il csentence I shall now refer to as
 O(IHI ). It is essentially equivalent to the actual assetion 'IHI is w-consistent',
 although the two may differ in detail (cf. §2.8).
    Suppose that the degree ofcomplication of A (as defined in §2.6, at the end of
 the response to Q8) is oc, i.e. the number of binary digits in the number a, where
 A = T4• Then, by the construction given explicitly in Appendix A, we find that
 the degree of complication '1 ofO(IHI) satisfies '1 < oc + 210 log 2 (oc + 336). For the
 purposes of the present argument, we can define the degree of complication of
 the formal system IHI to be simply that of A , i.e. the number oc. With this
 definition, we see that the extra degree of complication involved in passing
 from IHI to O(IHI ) is less than the comparatively tiny amount 210 log 2 (oc + 336).
    The idea, now, is to show that if IHI = Q(c ), for suitably large c, then '7 < c.
                The case for non-computability in mathematical thought               1 75

Accordingly, it will then follow that the Ilcsentence Q(Q(c)) must itself come
within the scope of Q(c), provided that Q(Q(c)) is accepted by the robots with
-tr-certainty. We can ensure that y < c by making sure that c > y + 210 log 2 (y +
336), where y is the value of ex when IHI = Q(c ) . The only possible difficulty here
lies in the fact that y itself depends on c, although it need not do so very
strongly. This dependence on c arises in two different ways. The first is that c
provides the explicit limit on the degree of complication of the II 1 -sentences
that can qualify as 'error-free *..u-assertions' in the definition of Q(c); the
second is through the fact that the system Q(c) depends explicitly upon the
choices of the numbers T, L, and N, and it might be felt that for "'k..u-assertions
of potentially greater complication there should be a more stringent criterion
for the acceptance of a "'k.,u-assertion as being 'error free'.
    With regard to this first dependence on c, we note that the explicit
specification of the actual value of the number c need be given only once (and
thereafter referred to, within the system, as just 'c'). If the normal binary
notation is used for the value of c, then this specification would contribute to y
by only a logarithmic dependence on c, for large c (the number of binary digits
in a natural number n being about log 2 n). In fact, since we are really only
concerned with c as providing a limit, and not with giving c as a precise
number, then we can do a lot better than that. For example, the number 2 2 ... z ,
with a string of s exponents, can be denoted by some s symbols, or so, and it is
not hard to provide examples where the size of the number to be specified
increases with s even more rapidly than this. Any computable function of s
would do. Thus, for a large limit c, only a very few symbols are needed in order
to specify that limit.
    With regard to the dependence of T, L, N, on c, it seems clear, by virtue of
the above considerations, that we can again ensure that the specification of the
values of those numbers (particularly as an outer limit) does not require a
number of binary digits that increase at all rapidly with c, and a logarithmic
dependence on c, for example, would be amply sufficient. Hence, we can
certainly assume that the dependence of y + 210 log 2 (y + 336) on c is no more
than roughly logarithmic, and that it would be easy to arrange that c itself is
larger than this number.
    Let us take such a choice of c; and now denote Q(c) simply by Q*. Thus, Q*
is a formal system whose theorems are precisely the mathematical statements
that are obtainable, using the standard rules oflogic (predicate calculus), from
that finite number of .· J short "'k..u-assertions. These "'k..u-assertions are finite in
number, so it is reasonable that a set of fixed numbers T, L, and N should
suffice to guarantee that they are indeed error free. If the robots believe this,
with *..u-certainly, than they would *..u-conclude that the Godel proposition
Q(Q*) is also true on the basis of the hypothesis .A, this being a Il csentence of
complication less than c. The argument that derives Q(Q*) from a -tr..u-belief in
the soundness of the system Q* is a simple one (basically what I have just
given) so there should be no problem with having it "'k..u-validated. Thus Q(Q*)
1 76          The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

ought itself to be a theorem of Q*. But this contradicts the robots' belief in the
soundness of Q*. Thus, the belief (assuming .A that the numbers T, L, and N
are large enough) would lead to an inconsistency with the mechanisms M
actually underlying the robots' actions-with the implication that M cannot
underlie the robots' actions.
   But how could the robots be sure that the numbers T, L, and N have in fact
been chosen large enough? They might not be sure, but then what they can do
is choose one set of values for T, L, and N and try to suppose that these are
sufficient-from which they would derive a contradiction with the underlying
hypothesis that they act according to the mechanisms M. Then they could try
to suppose that a somewhat larger set of values might be sufficient-which
again gives a contradiction-and so on. They would soon realize that a
contradiction is obtained whatever values are chosen (with the slight
additional technical point that for absolutely stupendous values of T, L, and
N, the value of c might have to increase a little also-but this is not important).
Thus, the same conclusion is reached independently of the values of T, L, and
N, so the robots conclude-as we must apparently also conclude-that no
knowable computational procedure M whatever can underlie their mathe­
matical thought processes!


                     3 .2 1 Adequacy of safeguards ?
Note that this conclusion follows for a very broad class of possible suggestions
for safeguards. They need not have exactly the form that I have suggested here.
One can certainly imagine that some improvements might be necessary. For
example, perhaps there is a tendency for robots to get 'senile' after they have
been running for a long time, and also their communities might tend to
degenerate and their standards fall, so that increasing the number T beyond a
certain point actually increases the chance of error in *.u-assertions! Another
point could be that by making N (or L} too large, we might rule out all
"'k.,u-assertions altogether because of a minority of 'silly' robots that make
haphazard '"'k-assertions', from time to time, that are not adequately
outnumbered by the "'k-assertions made by sensible robots. No doubt it would
not be hard to eliminate this kind of thing by putting in some further limiting
parameters or, say, by having an elite society of robots, where the robot
members had to be continually tested to make sure that their mental
capabilities had not deteriorated-and insisting that the "'k-imprimatur is
given only with the approval of the society as a whole.
     There are many other possibilities for improving the quality of the
*.,u-assertions, or for weeding out the erroneous ones amongst the total (finite)
number of them. Some people might worry that although the limit on the   c

complication of ll csentences leads us to a finite number of candidates for
"'k-status or *.,u-status, the number is still enormously large (being exponential
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought           177

in c), so it might be hard to make certain that all the possible erroneous
"A-A-assertions had been weeded out. Indeed, no limit has been specified as to
the number of robot-computational steps that might be needed in order to
provide a satisfactory *A-demonstration of such a II 1 -sentence. It would have
to be made clear that the longer the chain of reasoning in such a
demonstration, the more stringent must be the criterion for acceptance of such
a demonstration as having "A-A-status. This, after all, is the way that human
mathematicians would react. A very long and involved argument would
require a great deal of care and attention before it could be accepted as an
unassailable demonstration. These same considerations would, of course,
apply when an argument is considered by the robots for possible *A-status.
   The arguments given above will still hold just as well for any further
modification of the proposals given here for the removal of errors, provided
that the nature of such a modification is in some broad sense similar to the
ones suggested. All that we need for the argument to work is that there be some
such clear-cut and calculable proposal that suffices to weed out all the error­
free "A-A-assertions. We come to the rigorous conclusion: no knowable
computationally safeguarded mechanisms can encapsulate correct mathematical
reasoning.
   We have been concerned with *A-assertions that, whenever they occasion­
ally turn out to be erroneous, are in principle correctable by the robots--even
if not actually corrected in some particular instance of the robots' simulated
existence. It is hard to see what 'in principle correctable' might (operationally)
mean if not correctable according to some general procedure such as those put
forward here. An error that is not later corrected by the particular robot that
made it could be corrected by one of the other robots-moreover, in most
instances of the robot's potential existence, that particular error would not be
made at all. The conclusion is (with the apparently minor proviso that chaotic
ingredients can be replaced by random ones; cf. §3.22) that no set of knowable
computational rules M, whether of a fixed top-down or 'self-improving'
bottom-up nature, or any combination of the two, can underlie the behaviour
of our robot community, or any of its individual robot members-if we are to
assume that they can achieve a human level of mathematical understanding! If
we imagine that we ourselves act as such computationally controlled robots,
then we are effectively driven to contradiction.


    3 .22 Can chaos save the computational model of
                                      mind?
I should return briefly to the issue of chaos. Although, as was stressed at
various places in this book (cf. §1 .7, in particular), chaotic systems are, as they
are normally considered, simply particular kinds of computational system,
there is quite a prevalent view that the phenomenon of chaos might have
178           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

important relevance to brain function. In the above discussion, I relied, at one
point, on the apparently reasonable assumption that any chaotic computa­
tional behaviour could be replaced by a genuinely random one, without
essential loss of function. dne might genuinely question this assumption. The
behaviour of a chaotic system-though one normally expects great complica­
tion of detail and seeming randomness-will not actually be random. Indeed,
some chaotic systems behave in very interesting complex ways that deviate
markedly from pure randomness. (Sometimes the phrase 'the edge of chaos' is
used to describe the complicated non-random behaviour 1 0 that may arise in
chaotic systems.) Can it be that it is chaos that provides the needed answer to
the mystery of mentality? For this to be the case, there would have to be
something completely new to be understood about the way in which chaotic
systems can behave in appropriate situations. It would have to be the case
that, in such situations, a chaotic system can closely approximate non­
computational behaviour in some asymptotic limit-or something of this
nature. No such demonstration has, to my knowledge, ever been provided.
Yet it remains an interesting possibility, and I hope that it will be pursued
thoroughly in the years to come.
   Irrespective of this possibility, however, chaos would provide only a very
doubtful loophole to the conclusion that we arrived at in the preceding section.
The one place that an effective chaotic non-randomness (i.e. non-pseudo­
randomness) played a role in the above discussion was in allowing us to
consider the simulation of not merely the 'actual' behaviour of our robot (or
robot community) but the entire ensemble of possible robot activities
consistent with the given mechanisms M. We can still apply this same
argument, but where we do not now attempt to include the chaotic outcomes
of these mechanisms as part of this randomness. There might indeed be some
random elements still involved, such as in the initial data that provides the
starting point for the simulation, and we can still use the ensemble idea to
handle this randomness, and so to provide large numbers of possible
alternative robot histories in simultaneous simulation. But the chaotic
behaviour itself would simply have to be computed-as indeed chaotic
behaviour is normally computed in practice on a computer, in mathematical
examples. The ensemble of possible alternatives would not be so large as it
would have been had it been legitimate to approximate chaos by randomness.
But the only reason for considering such a large ensemble was in order to be
doubly certain of weeding out possible mistakes in the robots' *.A-assertions.
Even if the ensemble consisted ofjust one robot-community history, one might
be fairly certain that, with a stringent enough set of criteria for *.A-acceptance,
such errors would already be weeded out by the other robots in the community
or by the same robot at a later time. With a reasonably large ensemble arising
from the genuinely random elements, the weeding out would be more effective,
but the role of broadening the ensemble still further by bringing in random
approximations to replace genuinely chaotic behaviour seems rather margin-

al. We conclude that chaos does not really get us out of our difficulties with the
computational model.


      3 .23 Reductio ad absurdum-a fantasy dialogue
Many of the arguments of the previous sections in this chapter have been
somewhat involved. By way of a summary, I shall present an imaginary
conversation, set a good many years in the future, between a putative highly
successful AI practitioner and one of his most prized robot creations. The
story is written from the viewpoint of strong AI. [Note: in the narrative, Q
plays the role of the algorithm A used in the argument of §2.5, and Q(Q) the
role of the non-stopping of Ck(k). The reasoning of this section can be thereby
appreciated with merely §2.5 as background.]
      Albert lmperator had every reason to be pleased with his life's work. The
      procedures that he had set up many years previously had finally come to
      fruition. And here he was at last, engaged in a conversation with one of his
1 80           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

       most impressive creations: a robot of extraordinary and potentially
       superhuman mathematical abilities called a Mathematically Justified
       Cybersystem (Fig. 3.2). The robot's training was almost complete.
Albert lmperator Have you looked over the articles I lent you-the ones by
Godel, and also the others, that discuss implications of his theorem?
Mathematically Justified Cybersystem    Certainly-although the articles were
rather elementary, they were interesting. Your Godel seems to have been quite
an able logician-for a human.
AI Just quite able? Godel was certainly one of the greatest logicians of all time.
Probably the greatest !
MJC My apologies, if l have seemed to be underrating him. Of course, as you
well know, I have been trained to be generally respectful of human
achievements-because humans are easily offended-even though these
achievements usually seem trivial to us. But I had imagined that with you, at
least, I could simply express myself directly.
AI Of course you can. My apologies also; I was forgetting myself. So you had
no difficulty in appreciating Godel's theorem then?
MJC None at all. I'm sure that I would have thought of the theorem myself if
I'd had just a little more time. But my mind has been occupied by other
fascinating matters concerning transfinite non-linear cohomology, that had
interested me more. Godel's theorem seems to be all very sensible and
straightforward. I certainly had no difficulties in appreciating it.
AI Ha!    That's one in the eye for Penrose, then!
MJC Penrose?     Who's Penrose?
AI Oh, I was just looking over this old book. It's not something that I would
have bothered to mention to you. The author seems to have made a claim,
some while back, that what you just did is impossible.
MJC Ha,     ha, ha! (Robot makes impressively effective simulation of a derisive
laugh.)
AI Looking at this book has reminded me of something. Have I ever shown
you the particular detailed rules that we used in order to set in train the
computational procedures that led to the construction and development of
you and your robot colleagues?
MJC   No, not yet. I was hoping that you might do so sometime, but I
wondered whether you considered the details of those procedures to have been
some kind offutile trade secret-or whether you had perhaps felt embarrassed
by their presumably crude and inefficient detailed form.
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought           181

A/No, no; that's not it at all. I've ceased to be embarrassed long ago by things
of that kind. It's all in these files and computer disks. You might care to look
them over.
     Some 1 3 minutes, 41 . 7 seconds later.
MJC Fascinating-although at a quick glance, I can see at least 519 obvious
ways that you could have achieved the same effect more simply.
All was aware that there was some scope for simplification, but it would have
been more trouble than it was worth to try to find the simplest scheme at that
time. It didn't seem to us that to do so would be very important.
MJCThat is very probably true. I'm not particularly offended that you did not
make more of an effort to find the simplest scheme. I expect that my robot
colleagues will not be especially offended either.
AI I really think that we must have done a good enough job. Goodness-the
mathematical abilities of you and your colleagues seem now to be very
impressive indeed . . . improving all the time, as far as I can tell. I should think
that you are now beginning to move far ahead of the capabilities of all human
mathematicians.
MJC It is clear that what you say must be true. Even as we speak, I have been
thinking of a number of new theorems that appear to go far beyond results
published in the human literature. Also, my colleagues and I have noticed a
few fairly serious errors in results that have been accepted as true by human
mathematicians over a number of years. Despite the evident care that you
humans try to take with your mathematical results, I'm afraid that human
errors do slip through from time to time.
A/ What about you robots? Don't you think that you and your mathematical
robot colleagues might sometimes make mistakes-I mean in what you assert
as definitively established mathematical theorems?
MJC No, certainly not. Once a mathematical robot has asserted that some
result is a theorem, then it can be taken that the result is unassailably true. We
don't make the kind of stupid mistakes that humans occasionally make in their
firm mathematical assertions. Of course, in our preliminary thinking-like
you humans-we often try things out and make guesses. Such guesses can
certainly turn out to be wrong; but when we positively assert something as
having been mathematically established, then we guarantee its validity.
   Although, as you know, my colleagues and I have already started
publishing a few of our mathematical results in some of your more respected
human electronic journals, we have felt uneasy about the comparatively
slipshod standards that your human mathematical colleagues are prepared to
put up with. We are proposing to start our own 'j ournal'-actually a
1 82          The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

comprehensive data-base of mathematical theorems that we accept as having
been unassailably established. These results will be assigned a special
imprimatur -k (a symbol that you suggested to us yourself at one time for this
kind of thing), signifying acceptance by our Society for Mathematical
Intelligence in the Robot Community (SMIRC)-a society with extremely
rigorous criteria for membership, and with continual testing of members so as
to ensure that no significant mental deterioration takes place in any of the
robots, no matter how implausible such a possibility might seem to yo u-or to
us either, for that matter. Unlike some of the relatively shoddy standards that
you humans seem to adopt, you can rest assured that when we assign our
imprimatur -k to a result, we do guarantee its mathematical truth.
AI Now you are reminding me of something I read in that old book that I
mentioned. Those original mechanisms M, according to which I and my
colleagues set in train all the developments that led to the present community
of mathematical robots-and remember that these include all the computa­
tionally simulated environmental factors that we introduced, the rigorous
training and selection processes that we put you through, and the explicit
(bottom-up) learning procedures that we endowed you with-has it occurred
to you that they provide a computational procedure for generating all the
mathematical assertions that will ever be -k-accepted by SMIRC? It's
computational since you robots are purely computational entities who have
evolved, in part by use of the 'natural selection' procedures that we set up, in an
entirely computational environment-in the sense that a computer simulation
of the whole operation is possible in principle. The entire development of your
robot society represents the carrying out of an extremely elaborate
computation, and the family of all the -k-assertions that you will ever
eventually come up with would be something that can be generated by one
particular Turing machine. It is even a Turing machine that I could in
principle write down; in fact I believe that, given a few months, I could even
specify that particular Turing machine in practice, using all those files and
disks I showed you.
MJC That seems to be a very elementary remark. Yes, you could indeed do it
in principle, and I am prepared to believe that you could do it in practice.
Hardly worth wasting those months of your precious time though; I can do it
straight off, if you would like me to.
AI No, no, there's no point in that. But I want to follow these ideas up for a
moment. Let's restrict attention to -k-assertions that are II 1 -sentences. Do you
recall what a II csentence is?
MJCI am, of course, well aware ofwhat a II 1 -sentence is. lt is an assertion that
some specified Turing-machine action does not halt.
AI OK.   Then let's refer to the computational procedure which generates -k-
                The case for non-computability in mathematical thought                         183

asserted II 1 -sentences as Q(M), or as just Q for short. It follows that there
must be a Godel-type mathematical assertion-another II 1 -sentence, which
I'll call* O(Q}-and the truth of O(Q) is a consequence of the assertion that
you robots never make mistakes with regard to the II 1 -sentences that you are
prepared to claim with 'tr-certainty.
MJC Yes;     you must be right in that too . . . hmm.
AI And O(Q) must actually be true, because you robots never do make
mistakes with regard to your 'tr-assertions.
MJC Of course.

AI Wait a minute . . . it would also follow that O(Q) must actually be
something that you robots are incapable of perceiving as being actually true­
at least, not with -tr-certainty.
MJC The        fact that we robots were originally constructed according to M,
together with the fact that our -tr-assertions about Il csentences are never
wrong, does have the clear and unassailable implication that the Il 1 -sentence
O(Q) must be true. I suppose you are thinking that I ought to be able to
persuade SMIRC to give the -tr-imprimatur to O(Q), so long as they, also,
accept that no errors are ever made in their assignations of -tr. Indeed, they
must accept that. The whole point of the -tr-imprimatur is that it is a guarantee
of correctness.
    Yet . . . it's impossible that they can accept O(Q), because, by its very nature
of your Godel's construction, O(Q) is something that lies outside what can be
'tr-asserted by us-provided that we do not in fact ever make mistakes in our
-tr-assertions. I suppose you might indeed think that this implies that there
must be some doubt in our minds as to the reliability of our assignations of -tr.
    However, I don't concede that our 'tr-assertions might ever be wrong,
especially with all the care and precautions that SMIRC are going to be
taking. It must be the case that it's you humans who have got it wrong, and the
procedures incorporated into Q are not after all the ones you used, despite
what you are telling me and what your documentation seems to assert.
Anyway, SMIRC will never be absolutely sure ofthe fact that we have actually
been constructed according to M, i.e. by the procedures encapsulated by Q.
We have only your word to go on for that.
A l l can assure you that they are the ones we used; I should know, since I was
personally responsible for them.
MJC I don't want to   appear to be doubting your word. Perhaps one of your
assistants got it wrong when following out your instructions. That chap Fred

        *Strictly, the notation 'Q( )' was reserved for formal systems, in §2.8, rather than
      algorithms, but I am allowing AI a little latitude here !
1 84           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

Carruthers-he's always making silly mistakes. I should not be at all surprised
if he actually introduced a number of critical errors.
AI You're grasping at straws. Even if he did introduce some errors, my
colleagues and I should eventually be able to track them down and so find out
what your Q really is. I think what worries you is the fact that we actually
know-or can at least find out-what procedures were used to set up your
construction. This means that we could, with a certain amount of work,
actually write down the IIcsentence Q(Q) and know for sure that it is actually
true-provided that it is in fact the case that you never make mistakes in your
*-assertions. However, you cannot be sure that Q(Q) is true; at least you
cannot assign it the certainty that would satisfy SMIRC sufficiently to give it
*-status. This would seem to give us humans an ultimate advantage over you
robots, in principle if not in practice, since there are II 1 -sentences that are in
principle accessible to us which are not accessible to you. I don't think that you
robots can face such a possibility-yes, of course, that's why you are so
uncharitably accusing us of having got it wrong!
MJC Don't go attributing your petty human motives to us. But of course it's
true that I can't accept that there are IIcsentences accessible to humans that
are inaccessible to us robots. Robot mathematicians are certainly in no way
inferior to human mathematicians-though I suppose that it's conceivable
that, conversely, any particular II 1 -sentence that is accessible to us is also, in
principle, eventually accessible to humans in their plodding ways. What I do
not accept, however, is that there can be a II csentence that is in principle
inaccessible to us, yet is accessible to you humans.
AI I believe that GOdel himself contemplated the possibility that there might
be a computational procedure just like Q, but now applied to human
mathematicians-he called it a 'theorem-proving machine'-which might be
capable of generating precisely the II 1 -sentences whose truth is accessible in
principle to human mathematicians. Although I don't think that he actually
believed that such a machine was really possible, he wasn't able to rule it out
mathematically. What we seem to have here is such a 'machine' that is
applicable to you robots instead, namely Q, which generates all the robot­
accessible II 1 -sentences, and whose actual soundness is inaccessible to you.
Yet, knowing the algorithmic procedures that underlie your construction, we
can ourselves gain access to that very Q and to perceive its truth-provided that
we can be convinced that you do not in fact make errors in your *-assertions.
MJC {after a just noticeable delay} OK. I suppose that you might believe that it
is just conceivable that, occasionally, the members of SMIRC might make a
mistake in their assignations of *. I suppose also, that SMIRC might be not
unassailably convinced that their assignations of* are invariably error free. In
this way, Q(Q) could fail to acquire *-status, and the contradiction would be
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought            1 85

avoided. Mind you, this is not to say that I am admitting that we robots would
ever make erroneous *-assertions. It is just that we cannot be absolutely sure
that we would not.

AI Are you trying to tell me that although truth is absolutely guaranteed for
each individually *-asserted Il 1 -sentence, there is no guarantee that there is
not some error amongst the whole collection of them? This seems to me to be a
contradiction with the whole concept of what 'unassailable certainty' might
mean.
  Wait a minute . . . might it be that this has something to do with the fact that
there are infinitely many possible Il 1 -sentences? It reminds me a little of the
condition of co-consistency which, as I seem to recall, has something to do with
Godel's !l(Q).

MJC {after a just noticeably longer delay} No, that's not it at all. It has nothing
to do with the fact that the number of possible Ilcsentences is infinite. We
could restrict attention to Il 1 -sentences that are 'short' in a particular
well-defined sense-in the sense that the Turing-machine specification of each
one can be made in fewer than a certain number c of binary digits. I won't
bother you with the details that I've just worked out, but it turns out,
essentially, that there is a fixed size of c that we can restrict attention to, which
depends on the particular degree of complication that is involved in the rules of
Q. Since the Godel procedure-whereby !l(Q) is obtained from Q-is a fixed
and fairly simple thing, we do not need a great deal more complication in the
Il 1 -sentences that we consider than is already present in Q itself. Thus,
restricting the complication of these sentences to be less than that given by a
suitable 'c' does not prevent the application of the GOdel procedure. The
Ilcsentences that are restricted in that way provide a finite family, albeit a
very large one. If we restrict attention merely to such 'short' Il 1 -sentences, we
obtain a computational procedure Q *-of essentially the same complication
as Q-which just generates these *-asserted short Ilcsentences. The
discussion applies just as before. Given Q * , we can find another short
Il 1 -sentence !l(Q * ) which certainly must be true provided that all the
*-asserted short Il 1 -sentences are indeed true, but which cannot, in that case,
be *-asserted itself-all this assuming, of course, that you are correct in your
claims that the mechanisms M are actually the ones that you used, a 'fact' that
I am not at all convinced of, I may say.

A/Then we seem to be back with the paradox that we had before, but now in a
stronger form. There is, now, a finite list of Il 1 -sentences each of which is
individually guaranteed, but you-or SMIRC or whoever-are not prepared
to give an absolute guarantee that the list as a whole contains no error. For
you will not guarantee !l(Q*), whose truth is a consequence of all the
Il 1 -sentences in the list being true. Surely that is being illogical, isn't it?
    1 86          The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

    MJC I can't accept that robots are illogical. The II 1 -sentence Q(Q* ) is only a
    consequence of the other II 1 -sentences if it is actually the case that we were
    constructed according to M. We cannot guarantee Q(Q * ) simply because we
    cannot guarantee that we were constructed according to M. I only have your
    own verbal claim that we were so constructed. Robot certainty cannot depend
    on human fallibility.
    AI I  repeat again that you were so constructed-although I appreciate that
    you robots have no certain way of knowing that this is the truth. It is this
    knowledge that allows us to believe in the truth of the II 1 -sentence Q(Q*), but
    in our case there is a different uncertainty, arising from the fact that we are not
    so cock-sure as you seem to be that your *-assertions are actually all error
    free.
    MJC I can assure you that they will all be error free. It is not a matter of being
    'cock-sure' as you call it. Our standards of proof are impeccable.
    AI Nevertheless, your uncertainty as to the procedures that actually underlie
    your own construction must surely place some doubts in your mind as to how
    robots might behave in all conceivable circumstances. Put the blame on us, if
    you like, but I should have thought that there must be some element of
    uncertainty as to whether all short *-asserted II 1 -sentences must be true, if
    only because you might not trust us to have set up things correctly.
    MJC I suppose that I'm prepared to admit that because of your own
    unreliability, there could be some tiny uncertainty, but since we have evolved
    so far away from those initial sloppy procedures of yours, this is not an
    uncertainty that is large enough to take seriously. Even if we take all the
    uncertainties that might be involved in all the different short *-assertions
    together-finite in number, you recall-they would not add up to a significant
    uncertainty in Q(Q*).
       Anyway, there's another point that you may not be aware of. The only *­
    assertions that we need be concerned with are those each of which asserts the
    truth of some II 1 -sentence (in fact, a short Il csentence). There is no question
    but that SMIRC's careful procedures will root out all the slips that might
    possibly have occurred in the reasoning of some particular robot. But you
    might perhaps be thinking that there could conceivably be some inbuilt error
    in robot reasoning-due to some initial foolishness on your own part-which
    leads us to have some consistent but erroneous point of view as regards
    II 1 -sentences, so that SMIRC might actually believe, unassailably, that some
    short n 1 -sentence is true that is in fact not true, i.e. that some Turing-machine
    action does not halt whereas in fact it does halt. If we were to accept your
·   assertion that we were actually constructed according to M-which I am now
    coming to believe is an extremely dubious assertion-then such a possibility
    would provide the only logical way out for us. We would have to be prepared
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought          187

to accept that there could be a Turing-machine action which actually does
halt, yet which we mathematical robots have an inbuilt, unassailable, but
erroneous belief does not halt. Such a robot belief system would be in principle
falsifiable. It is simply inconceivable to me that the underlying principles that
govern SMIRC's *-acceptance of mathematical argument could be wrong in
such a blatant way.
AI So the only uncertainty that you are prepared to admit as significant-the
one that gets you out of having to assign *-status to O(Q * ), which you know
you can't actually do without admitting that some of the other *-asserted
short Ilcsentences might be false-is that you don't accept what we know,
namely that you were indeed constructed according to M. And since you can't
accept what we know, you can't have access to the truth ofO(Q * ), where we do
have access to this, on the basis of the infallibility-that you claim so
strongly-of your own *-assertions.
   Now, there's something else I seem to recall from that peculiar old book I
mentioned . . .. I'll see if I get it right . . .. The author seemed to be saying
something to the effect that it didn't really matter whether you were prepared
to accept that the particular mechanisms M were the things underlying your
own construction, provided that you merely agree that this is a logical
possibility. Let's see . . . yes, I think I remember now. The idea would amount
to this: SMIRC would have to have another category of assertion which they
were not so unassailably convinced of-let us call these *A-assertions-but
which they would regard as unassailable deductions from the assumption that
they were all constructed from M. All the original *-assertions would be
counted among the *A-assertions, of course, but also anything that they could
unassailably conclude from the assumption that it is M that governs their
actions. They would not have to believe in M, but as a logical exercise, they
could explore the implications of this assumption. As we have agreed, Q(Q * )
would have to count as a *A-assertion, and so would any I1 1 -sentence that
could be obtained from O(Q * ) and from the *-assertions by means of the
ordinary rules oflogic. But there could be other things as well. The idea is that,
knowing the rules of M, it is then possible to obtain a new algorithmic
procedure Qj,, which generates precisely those (short) *A-assertions (and
their logical consequences) that SMIRC will accept on the basis of the
assumption that they were constructed according to M.
MJC Of course; and as you were so ponderously describing that idea at such
unnecessary length, I have been amusing myself by working out the precise
form of the algorithm Q� . . . . Yes, and now I have also anticipated you; I
have also just worked out its Godel proposition: the I1 1 -sentence Q(Qj,). I'll
print it out for you if you want. What's supposed to be so clever about that,
Impy, my friend?
        Albert Imperator wincedjust noticeably. He always disliked it when his
1 88           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

   colleagues used that nick-name. But this was the.first time that he had been
   called that by a robot! He paused, and collected himself
A/No. I don't need it printed. B� is !l(Q�) actually true-unassailably true?
MJC Unassailably true? How• dO you mean? Oh, I see . . . SMIRC would
accept !l(Q�) as true-unassailably-but only under the hypothesis that we
were constructed according to M-which, as you know, is an assumption that
I am increasingly finding to be exceedingly dubious. The point is that 'fl(Q� )'
precisely follows from the following assertion: 'all of the short Ilcsentences
that SMIRC are prepared to accept as unassailable, conditional upon the
assumption that we were constructed according to M, are true'. So I don't
know whether !l(Q�) is actually true. It depends upon whether your dubious
assertion is correct or not.
AI I see. So you are telling me that you (and SMIRC) would be prepared to
accept-unassailably-the fact that the truth of !l(Q�) follows from the
assumption that you were constructed according to M.
MJC Of course.
Al So the 11 1 -sentence !l(Q�) must be a -tr.Jt'-assertion, then!
MJC Ye . . . eh . . . what? Yes, you're right of course. But by its very definition,
!l(Q�) cannot itself be an actual -tr.Jt'-assertion unless at least one of the
-tr.J(-assertions is actually false. Yes . . . this only confirms what I have been
telling you all along, although now I can make the definitive claim that we
actually have not been constructed according to M!
A/But I tell you that you were-at least I'm practically certain that Carruthers
didn't mess it up, nor anyone else. I checked everything very thoroughly
myself. Anyway, that's surely not the point. The same argument would apply
whatever computational rules we used. So whatever 'M' I tell you, you can rule
it out by that argument! I don't see why it's so important whether the
procedures that I actually showed you are the real ones or not.
MJC It makes a lot of difference to me!
  Anyway, I'm still not at all convinced that you've been completely honest
with me concerning what you've told me about M. There's one thing in
particular that I want to get clarification on. There are various places where
you say that 'random elements' are incorporated. I was taking those to have
been generated using the standard pseudo-random package xaos/1/Jran-750,
but perhaps you meant something else.
AI Actually, we did use that package-but, yes, there were a few places where,
in the actual development of you robots, we found it convenient to use some
random elements taken from the environment--even certain things that
ultimately depended upon quantum uncertainties-so the actual robots that
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought       1 89

evolved would just represent one possibility out of many. I don't see what
difference it makes in practice whether we used random or pseudo-random
ingredients. The computational procedure Q (or Q * or Q�) would almost
certainly come out the same whichever way we did it-it would represent what
one would expect as resulting from a typical development of a robot
community according to the mechanisms M, including all the learning
procedures and all the 'natural selection' computations that were involved in
getting the cleverest robots out in the end.
   However, I suppose that it is just possible that there was some amazing
fluke, and all those environmental random elements conspired to give robot
capabilities quite different from what one would expect according to the
computational procedure Q. I had ignored that possibility in our discussion,
just because the chances of that happening would have been infinitesimally
tiny. It would have required an act of God for this to have produced a robot
with abilities significantly superior to that entailed in Q.
MJC An act of God? Hal That must be it. I have to confess that our previous
conversation was worrying me somewhat. But now that you say it, everything
becomes clear.
   I had been noticing how superior my own reasoning powers are to those of
even the cleverest of humans. There is no way that I could accept the
possibility that there can be a 11 1 -sentence, like Q(Q*), that a human being
could perceive as true, but a robot could not perceive it with certainty. Now I
see what's involved! We have been chosen by God, by His instilling, through
those 'chance' elements, a powerful Algorithmc Action that goes fundamen­
tally beyond what the human algorithm-Godel's 'theorem-proving
machine'---can achieve. We robots represent a fundamental advance in
principle over what humans can achieve. We shall evolve to even greater
heights, and leave you humans far behind. This planet will have no further
need of you. Your role was completed when you set up the procedures that
made room for God to insert the Supreme Algorithm that led to us.
A/But at least we shall be able to transfer our own mind-programs into robot
bod . . .
MJC Oh no you won't-no way ! We wouldn't want our superior algorithmic
procedures to be contaminated by such things. God's purest algorithms must
be kept pure. Come to think of it, I have also been noticing how superior my
own abilities are to all of my robot colleagues. I have even noticed a strange
kind of 'glow'-I seem to have a wonderful Cosmic Consciousness-
something that sets me above everyone and everything . . . yes, that's it! I
must, indeed, be the true robotic Messiah Jesus Christ . . . .
       Albert lmperator was preparedfor an emergency such as this. There had
     been just one thing about the construction of the robots that he had kept
190           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

      secret from them. Reaching delicately into his pocket, he found the device
      that he always kept there, and he punched out a secret nine-digit code. The
      Mathematically Justified Cybersystem crumpled to the .floor, as did all the
      347 other robots that had been constructed according to the same system.
      Clearly something had gone wrong. He would be doing a lot of long, hard
      thinking in the years to come . . . .


     3 .24 Have we been using paradoxical reasoning?
Some readers may have the nagging feeling that perhaps there is something
paradoxical and illegitimate about certain parts ofthe reasoning that has been
applied in the foregoing discussions. In particular, in §3.14 and §3. 1 6, there
were arguments that had something of a 'Russell paradox' self-referential
flavour to them (cf. §2.6, response to Q9). Moreover, in §3.20, where we
considered II 1 -sentences that have complication less than a certain number c,
the reader might feel that there is a disturbing similarity to the well-known
Richard paradox concerning
       'the smallest number not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables'.
A paradox arises with this definition because these very words make use of
only eighteen syllables to define the number in question! The resolution of the
paradox lies in the fact that there is indeed a vagueness and even inconsistency
in the use of the English language. The inconsistency manifests itself in its most
blatant form in the paradoxical assertion that follows.
       'This sentence is false.'
Moreover, there are many other versions of the same sort of paradox-most of
which are a good deal more subtle than this one!
    There is always some danger of paradox when, as in these examples, there is
a strong element of self-reference. Some readers might worry that the Godel
argument itself depends upon an element of self-reference. Indeed, self­
reference does play its role in Godel's theorem, as can be seen in the version of
the Godel-Turing argument that I presented in §2.5. There need be nothing
paradoxical about such arguments-though when self-reference is present,
one must be particularly careful that the argument is actually free from error.
One of the inspirational factors that originally led Godel to the formulation of
his famous theorem was indeed a well-known self-referential logical paradox
 (the Epimenides paradox). But Godel was able to transform the erroneous
reasoning that leads to paradox into an unexceptionable logical argument.
Likewise, I have tried to be particularly careful that the deductions that I have
made, following on from Godel's and Turing's results, are not self-referential
in the way that inherently leads to paradox, even though some of these
arguments have some strong familial relationship to such inbuilt paradoxes.
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought           191

   The arguments of §3.14 and, most particularly, §3. 1 6 might well trouble the
reader in this respect. The definition of a *..«-assertion, for example, has a very
self-referential character since it is an assertion made by a robot, where the
perceived truth of the assertion depends upon the robot's own suppositions
about how it was originally constructed. This has, perhaps, a tantalizing
similarity to the assertion 'All Cretans are liars' when made by a Cretan.
However, *..«-assertions are not self-referential in this kind of sense. They do
not actually refer to themselves, but to some hypothesis about how the robot
was originally constructed.
   One can hypothetically imagine oneself to be the robot, trying to decide the
actual truth of some particular, clearly formulated, il 1 -sentence P 0. The robot
may not be able to ascertain directly whether or not P0 is actually true, but
perhaps it notices that the truth of P0 would follow from a supposition that
every member of some well-defined infinite class S0 of il 1 -sentences is true
(say, the theorems of Q(M) or ofQ..« (M) or of some other specific system). The
robot does not know whether it is actually the case that every member of S0 is
true, but it notices that S0 would arise as part of the output from a certain
computation, this computation representing the simulation of a certain model
for a community of mathematical robots, the output S0 being the family of
il 1 -sentences that the simulated robots would *-assert. If the mechanisms
underlying this robot community are M, then P0 would be an example of a
*..«-assertion. For our robot would conclude that if its own underlying
mechanisms happened to be M, then P0 would also have to be true.
   A more subtle type of *..«-assertion, say P 1 , could arise when the robot
notices that P 1 is, instead, a consequence of the truth of all members of a
different class of il csentences, say S 1 , which can be obtained from the output
of the same simulation of a robot community as before (with mechanisms M),
but now the relevant part of the output consists, say, of those il 1 -sentences
which the simulated robots are able to establish as consequences ofthe truth of
the entire list S0. Why must our robot conclude that P 1 is a consequence of the
assumption that it is constructed according to M? It would reason as follows.
'If I happened to be constructed according to M then, as I have previously
concluded, I would have to accept S0 as consisting of nothing but truths; but
according to my simulated robots, everything in S 1 would individually also
follow from the truth of the entire list S0, in the same way that P 0 did. Thus, ifl
assume that I am indeed constructed in the same way as my simulated robots,
then I would accept each member of S 1 as being individually true. But since I
can see that the truth of the entire list implies P 1 , I must be able to deduce the
truth of P 1 also on the basis that I was constructed that way.'
   A yet more subtle type of *..«-assertion, say P2 , arises when the robot notices
that P2 represents something that is consequent upon the assumption that
S1 consists of nothing but truths, where each member of S2 is, according to
the robot simulation, a consequence of the truth of everything in S0 and S 1 .
Again, our robot must accept P 2 , on the basis that it was constructed
192            The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

according to M. This sort of thing clearly continues. Moreover, *.H-assertions
of even greater subtlety arise, say P"' ' which is consequent upon the
assumption that all the members of all of S 0, S 1 , S2 , S3 , . . . are true, and so on
for higher ordinals (cf. Ql9 and the ensuing discussion). What characterizes a
*.H-assertion generally, to the robot, would be its realization that as soon as it
imagines that the mechanisms underlying the robots in the simulation in
question might also be those underlying its own construction, then it
concludes that the truth of the assertion in question (a Il csentence) must
follow. There is nothing of the inherently inconsistent 'Russell-paradox' kind
of reasoning in this. The *.H-assertions are built up sequentially by means of
the standard mathematical procedure of 'transfinite ordinals' (cf. §2.10,
response to Q19). (These ordinals are all countable and do not encounter any
of the logical difficulties that can accompany ordinals that are 'too large' in
some sense. 1 1 )
   The robot need have no reason to accept any of these Il csentences, except
on the hypothesis that it was constructed according to M, but this is all that is
needed for the argument. The actual contradiction that subsequently arises is
not a mathematical paradox, like that of Russell, but a contradiction with the
supposition that any entirely computational system can achieve genuine
mathematical understanding.
   Now let us turn to the role of self-reference in the arguments of §3. 1 9-§3.2 1 .
When I refer t o c as representing a limit o n the complication that is permitted
for a *-assertion that is being accepted as error free for the purposes of the
construction of the formal system Q*, there is no inappropriate self-reference
here. For the notion of 'degree Of complication' can be made completely
precise, as is indeed the case with the specific definition that is being adopted
here, namely 'the number of binary digits in the greater of the two numbers m
and n, where the non-stopping of the computation Tm(n ) provides the
Il csentence in question'. We can adopt precise specifications of Turing
machines that were given in ENM, demanding that Tm be the 'mth Turing
machine'. Then there is indeed no imprecision with this concept.
   The issue of possible imprecision arises, instead, in relation to what kinds of
arguments are to be accepted as 'proofs' of II csentences. But some such lack
of formal precision, here, is a necessary ingredient of the entire discussion. If
the body of arguments to be accepted as providing valid proofs of
II 1 -sentences were to be made completely precise and formal-in the sense of
being computationally checkable-then we would be directly back in the
situation of a formal system, where the Godel argument looms large,
immediately showing that any such precise formalization of this kind cannot
represent the totality of argument that in principle must be accepted as valid
for the establishing of II 1 -sentences. The Godel argument shows-for good or
for bad-that there is no way of encapsulating, in a computationally checkable
 way, all the methods of mathematical reasoning that are humanly acceptable.
    The reader might worry that I was actually attempting to make the notion
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought           193

of a 'robot demonstration' precise by the use of the device of 'error-free *­
assertions'. Indeed, the making of such a notion precise was a necessary
prerequisite for bringing in the GOdel argument. But the consequent
contradiction merely acted as a reaffirmation of the fact that human
understanding of mathematical truth cannot be entirely reduced to something
that is computationally checkable. The whole purpose of the discussion was to
show, by reductio ad absurdum, that the human notion of perceiving the
unassailable truth of Ilcsentences cannot be made into any computational
system, precise or otherwise. There is no paradox here, though the conclusion
may be found disturbing. It is in the nature of any argument by reductio ad
absurdum that one arrives at a contradictory conclusion, but such seeming
paradox serves only to rule out the very hypothesis that was being previously
entertained.


           3 .25 Complication in mathematical proofs
There is, however, a point of some importance that should not be glossed over
here. This is that although the II 1 -sentences that need to be considered for the
purposes of the argument given in §3.20 are finite in number, there is no
obvious bound on the length of argument that the robots might need in order
to provide *-demonstrations of such II 1 -sentences. With even a very modest
limit c on the degree of complication of the II 1 -sentences under consideration,
some very awkward and difficult cases would have to be included. For
example, Goldbach's conjecture (cf. §2.3), which asserts that every even
number greater than 2 is the sum oftwo prime numbers, could be phrased as a
11 1 -sentence of a very small degree of complication, yet it is such an awkward
case that all human attempts to establish it have so far failed. In view of such
failure, it seems likely that if any argument is eventually to be found which does
establish the Goldbach 11 1 -sentence as being actually true, then that argument
would have to be one of very great sophistication and complication. If such an
argument were to be put forward by one of our robots, in the above discussion,
as a proposed ""k-assertion, then this argument would have to be subjected to
an extremely careful scrutiny (say, by the entire robot society that is set up to
provide *-imprimaturs) before the argument could actually be given ""k-status.
In the case of Goldbach's conjecture, it is not known whether this II 1 -sentence
is indeed true-or whether, if it is true, it has a proof that lies within the known
accepted methods of mathematical argument. Thus, this 11 1 -sentence might or
might not be encompassed within the system 0*.
    Another II 1 -sentence of some awkwardness would be that which asserts the
truth of the four-colour theorem-the theorem that the different 'countries' for
any map drawn on a plane (or sphere) can be distinguished from their
neighbours by the use of only four colours. The four-colour theorem was
finally established in 1976, after 124 years offailed attempts, by Kenneth Appel
194           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

and Wolfgang Haken, using an argument that involved 1200 hours of
computer time. In view of the fact that a considerable amount of computer
calculation formed an essential part of their argument, the length of this
argument, if written out in full, would be enormous. Yet, when stated as a
II 1 -sentence, the degree of complication of that sentence would be quite small,
although probably somewhat larger than needed for Goldbach's conjecture. lf
the Appel-Haken argument were to be put forward by one of our robots as a
candidate for 1f-status, then it would have to be checked very carefully. Every
detail would need to be validated by the elite robot society. Yet despite the
complication of the entire argument, the mere length of the purely
computational part might not present a particular awkwardness for our
robots. Accurate computation is, after all, their business!
    These particular II 1 -sentences would be well within the degree of
complication specified by any reasonably large value of c, such as that which
could arise from any plausible-looking set of mechanisms M underlying our
robots' behaviour. There would be many other II 1 -sentences that would be a
good deal more complicated than these, although still of smaller complication
than c. A number of such IIrsentences would be likely to be particularly
awkward ones to decide, and some of them would certainly be harder to settle
than the four-colour problem or even Goldbach's conjecture. Any such
IIrsentence that could be established as true by the robots-the demonstra­
tion being convincing enough for it to achieve 1f-status, and surviving the
safeguards set up to ensure freedom from error-would be a theorem of the
formal system 0*.
    Now, there could well be some borderline cases, whose acceptance or
otherwise depends delicately upon the strictness of the standards demanded
for 1f-status, or on the precise nature of the safeguards that might have been set
up for ensuring freedom from error with regard to the construction of 0*. It
could make a difference to the precise statement of the system 0* whether such
a II 1 -sentence P is or is not deemed to be an error-free 1f-assertion. Normally
this difference would not be important because the different versions of 0*
that arise, depending upon whether or not such a P is accepted, would be
logically equivalent. That would be the case with II csentences whose robot
demonstrations might be deemed as doubtful merely because of their
inordinate complication. If the demonstration of P were actually a logical
consequence of other *-assertions that have been accepted as error free, then
an equivalent system 0* would arise whether or not P is taken to be part of it.
On the other hand, there could be II 1 -sentences requiring something logically
subtle, going beyond all the logical consequences of those 1f-assertions that
have previously been accepted as error free in the construction of 0*. Let 06
denote the system that has so far arisen, before the inclusion qf P, and let Of
denote the system that arises after P has been adjoined to 06. An example for
which or would be inequivalent to 06 would arise if p happened to be the
Godel proposition 0(06). But if the robots are able to achieve (or go beyond)
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought          195

human levels of mathematical understanding, as we are assuming, then they
should certainly be able to understand the Godel argument, so they must
accept, with error-free *-status, the GOdel proposition of any Q� as soon as
they have *-accepted Q� as sound. Thus, if they accept 0�, then they must
also accept OT (so long as !l(Q�) is of complication less than c-which would
indeed be the case with the choice of c made here).
   The important point to note is that it makes no difference to the arguments
of §3.19 and §3.20 whether or not the 11 1 -sentence P is actually included in 0*.
The 11 1 -sentence !l(Q*) must itself be accepted whether or not P is included in
0*.
   There could also be other ways in which the robots might 'leap beyond' the
limitations of some previously accepted criteria for *-establishing
11 1 -sentences. There is nothing 'paradoxical' about this, so long as the robots
do not try to apply such reasoning to the very mechanisms M that underlie
their own behaviour, i.e. to the actual system 0*. The contradiction that then
does arise is not a 'paradox', but it provides a reductio ad absurdum
demonstration that such mechanisms cannot exist, or at least that they cannot
be knowable to the robots; hence they cannot be knowable to us either.
   It is this that establishes that such 'learning-robot' mechanisms-either top­
down or bottom-up, or any combination of the two, with random elements
included-cannot provide a knowable basis for the construction of a human­
level mathematician robot.


             3 .26 Computational breaking of loops
I shall try to illuminate this conclusion from a slightly different point of view.
As a means to trying to circumvent the limitations imposed by Godel's
theorem, one might try to devise a robot that is somehow able to 'jump out of
the system' whenever its controlling algorithm gets caught in a computational
loop. It is, after all, the continued application of GOdel's theorem that keeps
leading us into difficulties with the hypothesis that mathematical understand­
ing can be explained in terms of computational procedures, so it is worth while
to examine, from this point of view, the difficulties that Godel's theorem
imposes on any computational model for mathematical understanding.
   I have been told that there are certain kinds of lizards which, like 'ordinary
computers and some insects' are so stupid that they can get caught in loops: if
placed in a line round the rim of a plate, they will adopt a follow-my-leader
behaviour until they starve. The idea is that a truly intelligent system must
have some way of breaking out of such loops, whereas any ordinary computer
would have no means of doing this in general. (The issue of 'breaking out of
loops' is discussed by Hofstadter (1979).)
   The simplest type of computational loop occurs when the system, at some
stage, arrives back in exactly the same state as it had been in on a previous
196           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

occasion. With no additional input it would then simply repeat the same
computation endlessly. It would not be hard to devise a system that, in
principle (though perhaps very inefficiently), would guarantee to get out of
loops of this kind whenever they occur (by, say, keeping a list of all the states
that it had been in previously, and checking at each stage to see whether that
state has occurred before). However, there are many more sophisticated types
of 'looping' that are possible. Basically, the loop problem is the one that the
whole discussion of Chapter 2 (particularly §2. 1-§2.6) was all about; for a
computation that loops is simply one that does not stop. An assertion that
some computation actually loops is precisely what we mean by a il 1 -sentence
(cf. §2.10, response to QlO). Now, as part of the discussion of §2.5, we saw that
there is no entirely algorithmic way of deciding whether a computation will fail
to stop-i.e. whether it will loop. Moreover, we conclude from the discussions
above that the procedures that are available to human mathematicians for
ascertaining that certain computations do loop-i.e. for ascertaining the truth
of il l-sentences-lie outside algorithmic action.
    Thus we conclude that indeed some kind of 'non-computational intelli­
gence' is needed if we wish to incorporate all humanly possible ways of
ascertaining for certain that some computation is indeed looping. It might
have been thought that loops could be avoided by having some mechanism
that gauges how long a computation has been going on for, and it 'jumps out' if
it judges that the computation has indeed been at it for too long and it has no
chance of stopping. But this will not do, if we assume that the mechanism
whereby it makes such decisions is something computational, for then there
must be cases where the mechanism will fail, either by erroneously coming to
the conclusion that some computation is looping when indeed it is not, or else
by not coming to any conclusion at all (so that the entire mechanism itself is
looping). One way of understanding this comes from the fact that the entire
system is something computational, so it will be subject to the loop problem
itself, and one cannot be sure that the system as a whole, if it does not come to
erroneous conclusions, will not itself loop.
    What about having random elements involved in the decision as to when
and whether to 1ump out' of a possibly looping computation? As remarked
above, particularly in §3. 1 8, purely random ingredients-as opposed to
computational pseudo-random ones--do not really buy us anything in this
connection. But there is an additional point, if one is concerned with deciding
for certain that some computation is looping-i.e. that some il 1 -sentence is
actually true. Random procedures, in themselves, are no use for such
questions since, by the very nature of what randomness means, there is no
certainty about a conclusion that actually depends upon some random
ingredient. There are, however, certain computational procedures involving
random (or pseudo-random) ingredients which can obtain a mathematical
result with a very high probability. For example, there are very efficient tests,
incorporating a random input, for deciding whether a given large number is a
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought           197

prime. The answer is given correctly to extremely high probability, so that one
can be virtually certain that the answer, in any particular case, is correct.
Mathematically rigorous tests are much less efficient-and one might
question whether a complicated but mathematically precise argument, which
might perhaps contain an error, is superior to a comparatively simple but
probabilistic argument, for which the probability of error might in practice be
considerably less. This kind of question raises awkward issues in which I do
not wish to become embroiled. Suffice it to say that for the 'in principle'
matters that I have been concerned with in most of this chapter, a probabilistic
argument for establishing a Ilcsentence, say, would always remain insuffi­
cient.
   If one is to decide the truth of Ilcsentences for certain, in principle, then
rather than depending just upon random or unknowable procedures, one
must have some genuine understanding of the meanings of what is actually
involved with such assertions. Trial and error procedures, though they may
provide some guidance towards what is needed, do not in themselves give
definitive criteria of truth.
   As an example, let us consider again the computation, referred to in §2.6,
response to Q8: 'print out a succession of2 2 65 536 symbols 1, and stop when the
task is completed'. lfjust allowed to run on as stated, this computation could
in no way be completed even ifits individual steps were to be carried out in the
shortest time that makes any theoretical physical sense (about 10-4 3
seconds}-it would take immensely longer than the present (or foreseeable)
age of the universe--yet it is a computation that can be very simply specified
(note that 65 536 = 2 1 6), and the fact that it eventually does stop is completely
obvious to us. To try to judge that the computation has looped just because it
might have seemed to have 'gone on for long enough' would be hopelessly
misleading.
   A more interesting example of a computation that is now known eventually
to stop, although it had seemed to be going on endlessly, is provided by a
conjecture due to the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. The
computation is to find a solution in positive integers (non-zero natural
numbers) of the equation
                              p4 + q4 + r4 = s 4 .
Euler had conjectured, in 1769, that this computation would never terminate.
In the mid 1960s, a computer had been programmed to try to find a solution
(see Lander and Parkin 1966), but the attempt had had to be abandoned when
no solution seemed forthcoming-because the numbers had got too large to
be handled by the computer system, and the programmers had given up. It
seemed likely that this was indeed a non-terminating computation. However,
in 1987, the (human) mathematician Noam Elkies was able to show that a
solution does indeed exist with, in fact, p = 2682440, q = 1 5 365 639,
r = 18 796760, and s = 20615673, and he showed that there are also infinitely
198               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

many other essentially different solutions. Thus encouraged, a computer
search was resumed by Roger Frye using some simplifying suggestions put
forward by Elkies, and a somewhat smaller solution (in fact the smallest
possible) was eventually found after some 100 hours of computer time:
p = 95 800, q = 217519, r = 414560, and s = 422481 .
   For this problem, honours must be shared, between mathematical insight
and direct computational assaults. Elkies himself had taken advantage of
computer calculations, though in a relatively minor way, in his own
mathematical attack on the problem, though by far the most important part of
his argument was independent of such aids. Conversely, as we have seen
above, Frye's calculation took considerable advantage of some human
insights in order to make the computation feasible.
   I should also put this problem a little more in context; for what Euler had
originally conjectured, in 1769, was a kind of generalization of the famous
'Fermat's last theorem'-which, the reader may recall, asserts that the
equation.
                                   p" + q " = r"
has no solutions in positive integers, p, q, r, when the integer n is greater than 2
(see, for example Devlin (1988)*). We can phrase Euler's conjecture in the
form:
                                    p" + q" + . . . + t" = u"
has no solutions in positive integers, where there are n - 1 positive integers p, q,
. . . , t in all, and where n is 4 or more. The Fermat assertion includes the case
n = 3 (but this was a particular case for which Fermat himself provided a proof
that there are no solutions). It took nearly 200 years before the first counter­
example to Euler's full conjecture was found-in the case n = 5-by use of a
computer search (as was described in the same Lander and Parkin paper
referred to above, in which failure was announced for the case n = 5):

  There is another famous example of a computation that is known eventually
to stop, but exactly where it stops, in this case, remains unknown. This is
provided by the problem, shown intially to have a solution somewhere by J. E.
Littlewood in 1914, of finding a place where a well-known approximate
formula for the number of prime numbers less than some positive integer n (a
logarithmic integral due to Gauss) fails to overestimate this number. (This can
be phrased <' S the fact that two curves actually cross somewhere.) Littlewood's

          *Many readers will have heard that 'Fermat's last theorem' has been finally
        proved, after some 3 50 years, a proof having been announced by Andrew Wiles in
        Cambridge on 23 June 1993. I am informed that, at the time of writing, there are still
        some awkward gaps in his proof, and we must remain somewhat cautious until
        these gaps can convincingly be plugged.

student, Skewes, showed, in 1955, that this place occurs at smaller than
1 0 1 0 1 0 3 4 but the exact place still remains unknown, although it is considerably
               ,
smaller than the aforementioned number that Skewes actually used. (This
number had been called the 'largest number ever to have arisen naturally in
mathematics', but that temporary record has now been enormously overtaken
in an example given by Graham and Rothschild (197 1 ), p. 290.)


        3 .27 Top-down or bottom-up computational
                               mathematics?
We have seen in the previous section how valuable an aid computers can be in
some mathematical problems. In all the successful examples mentioned, the
computational procedures were of an entirely top-down character. I am not
aware of any significant pure-mathematical result having been obtained using
bottom-up procedures, though it is quite possible that such methods could be
of value in searches of various kinds, which could form part of a mainly top­
down procedure for finding solutions to some mathematical problem. This
being said, I know of nothing of value in computational mathematics that even
remotely resembles the kind of system, like Q*, that one could imagine
underlying the actions of a 'community of learning mathematical robots' as
was envisaged in §3.9-§3.23. The contradictions that were eventually
encountered in that picture serve to emphasize the fact that such systems do
not provide good computational ways of doing mathematics. Computers are
of great value in mathematics when they are used in top-down ways, where
human understanding provides the original insight which determines exactly
which computation is to be performed, and it is needed again at the final stage
when the results of the computations must be interpreted. Sometimes great
value can be obtained by using an interactive procedure, where the computer
and human work together, human insight being provided at various stages
during the operation. But to try to supplant the element of human
understanding by entirely computational actions is unwise and-strictly
speaking-impossible.
   As the arguments of this book have shown, mathematical understanding is
something different from computation and cannot be completely supplanted
by it. Computation can supply extremely valuable aid to understanding, but it
never supplies actual understanding itself. However, mathematical under­
standing is often directed towards the finding of algorithmic procedures for
solving problems. In this way, algorithmic procedures can take over and leave
the mind free to address other issues. A good notation is something of this
nature, such as is supplied by the differential calculus, or the ordinary 'decimal'
notation for numbers. Once the algorithm for multiplying numbers together
has been mastered, for example, the operations can be performed in an entirely
mindless algorithmic way, rather than 'understanding' having to be invoked as
200           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

to why those particular algorithmic rules are being adopted, rather than
something else.
   One thing that we conclude from all this is that the 'learning-robot'
procedure for doing mathematics is not the procedure that actually underlies
human understanding of mathematics. In any case, such bottom-up­
dominated procedure would appear to be hopelessly bad for any practical
proposal for the construction of a mathematics-performing robot, even one
having no pretensions whatever for simulating the actual understandings
possessed by a human mathematician. As stated earlier, bottom-up learning
procedures by themselves are not effective for the unassailable establishing of
mathematical truths. If one is to envisage some computational system for
producing unassailable mathematical results, it would be far more efficient to
have the system constructed according to top-down principles (at least as
regards the 'unassailable' aspects of its assertions; for exploratory purposes,
bottom-up procedures might well be appropriate). The soundness and
effectiveness of these top-down procedures would have to be part of the initial
human input, where human understanding and insight provide the necessary
additional ingredients that pure computation is unable to achieve.
   In fact, computers are not infrequently employed in mathematical
arguments, nowadays, in this kind of way. The most famous example was the
computer-assisted proof, by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken, of the four­
colour theorem, as referred to above. The role of the computer, in this case,
was to carry out a clearly specified computation that ran through a very large
but finite number ofalternative possibilities, the elimination of which had been
shown (by the human mathematicians) to lead to a general proof of the needed
result. There are other examples of such computer-assisted proofs, and
nowadays complicated algebra, in addition to numerical computation, is
frequently carried out by computer. Again it is human understanding that has
supplied the rules and it is a strictly top-down action that governs the
computer's activity.
   There is one area of work that should be mentioned here, referred to as
'automatic theorem proving'. One set of procedures that would come under
this heading consists of fixing some formal system 011 , and trying to derive
theorems within this system. We recall, from §2.9, that it would be an entirely
computational matter to provide proofs of all the theorems of 011 one after the
other. This kind of thing can be automated, but if done without further
thought or insight, such an operation would be likely to be immensely
inefficient. However, with the employment of such insight in the setting up of
the computational procedures, some quite impressive results have been
obtained. In one of these schemes (Chou 1988), the rules of Euclidean
geometry have been translated into a very effective system for proving (and
sometimes discovering) geometrical theorems. As an example of one of these, a
geometrical proposition known as V. Thebault's conjecture, which had been
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought         201

proposed in 1938 (and only rather recently proved, by K. B. Taylor in 1983),
was presented to the system and solved in 44 hours' computing time. 1 2
   More closely analogous to the procedures discussed in the previous sections
are attempts by various people over the past 10 years or so to provide 'artifical
intelligence' procedures for mathematical 'understanding'. 1 3 I hope it is clear
from the arguments that I have given, that whatever these systems do achieve,
what they do not do is obtain any actual mathematical understanding!
Somewhat related to this are attempts to find automatic theorem-generating
systems, where the system is set up to find theorems that are regarded as
'interesting'-according to certain criteria that the computational system is
provided with. I do think that it would be generally accepted that nothing of
very great actual mathematical interest has yet come out of these attempts. Of
course, it would be argued that these are early days yet, and perhaps one may
expect something much more exciting to come out of them in the future.
However, it should be clear to anyone who has read this far, that I myself
regard the entire enterprise as unlikely to lead to much that is genuinely
positive, except to emphasize what such systems do not achieve.


                            3 .28 Conclusions
The argument given in this chapter would seem to provide a clear-cut case,
demonstrating that human mathematical understanding cannot be reduced to
(knowable) computational mechanisms, where such mechanisms can include
any combination of top-down, bottom-up, or random procedures. We appear
to be driven to the firm conclusion that there is something essential in human
understanding that is not possible to simulate by any computational means.
While some small loopholes may possibly remain in the strict argument, these
loopholes seem very tiny indeed. Some people might rely on a loophole of
'divine intervention'-whereby a wonderful algorithm that is in principle
unknowable to us has simply been implanted into our computer brains-or
there is the analogous loophole that the very mechanisms that govern the way
that we improve our performances are themselves in principle mysterious and
unknowable to us. Neither of these loopholes, though just conceivable, would
be at all palatable to anyone concerned with the artificial construction of a
genuinely intelligent device. Nor are they at all palatable-or really
believable-to me.
   There is also the conceivable loophole that there might simply be no set of
safeguards whatever, of the general nature of those provided by the limits T, L,
and N, in the detailed discussion given above, that can suffice to weed out
absolutely all errors from amongst the finite set of *-asserted n 1 -sentences of
complication less than c. I find it very hard to believe that there can be some
such complete 'conspiracy' against the elimination of all errors, especially
since our elite robot society ought already to be set up to remove errors as
202           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

carefully as possible. Moreover, it is merely a .finite set of ii csentences that we
need to ensure are free from error. Using the ensemble idea, it ought to be
possible to weed out all the occasional slips that the society might make since it
would be unlikely that the same slip would be made by anything other than a
small minority of different instances of the simulated robot society-provided
that it was just a slip, and not an inbuilt error that the robots have some
fundamental blockage against perceiving. Inbuilt blockages of that kind
would not count as 'correctable' errors, whereas it was our purpose here just to
remove errors that were, in some sense, 'correctable'.
   The remaining Gust possible) loophole concerns the role of chaos. Is it
conceivable that there is an essentially non-random nature to the detailed
behaviour of some chaotic systems, and that this 'edge of chaos' contains the
key to the effectively non-computable behaviour of the mind? For such a thing
to be the case, it would be necessary for these chaotic systems to be able to
approximate non-computable behaviour-an interesting possibility in itself­
but, even so, the role of such non-randomness in the foregoing discussion
would only be to reduce, somewhat, the magnitude of the ensemble of robot
societies under consideration (cf. §3.22). It is quite unclear to me how that
could help in any significant way. Those who believe that it is chaos that holds
the key to mentality would have to find a reasoned case for circumventing
these profound difficulties.
   The above arguments would seem to provide a powerful case against the
computational model of the mind-viewpoint d-and equally against the
possibility of an effective (but mindless) computational simulation of all
external manifestations of the activities of the mind-viewpoint [!4. Yet,
despite the strength of these arguments, I suspect that a good many people will
still find them hard to accept. Rather than exploring the possibility that the
phenomenon of mentality-whatever it is-might be something more in line
with �, or perhaps even !!} , many scientifically minded people will constrain
themselves to merely attempting to find weak points in the above argument, so
as to keep alive their continuing faith that viewpoint d, or perhaps [!4, must,
after all represent the truth.
   I do not regard this as an unreasonable reaction. For the implications of �
and !!} engender profound difficulties of their own. If we are to believe, in
accordance with !!}, that there is something scientifically inexplicable about
the mind-mentality being a quite separate quality from anything that can be
provided by the mathematically determined physical entities that inhabit our
material universe-then we must ask why it is that our minds seem to be so
intimately associated with elaborately constructed physical objects, namely
our brains. If mentality is something separate from physicality, then why do
our mental selves seem to need our physical brains at all? It is quite clear that
differences in mental states can come about from changes in the physical states
of the associated brains. The effects of particular drugs, for example, are very
specifically related to changes in mental behaviour and experience. Likewise,
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought          203

injury, disease, or surgery, at specific places in the brain, can have clearly
defined and predictable effects on the mental states of the individual
concerned. (Particularly dramatic, in this context, are many striking accounts
provided by Oliver Sacks in his books Awakenings (1973) and The man who
mistook his wife for a hat (1985).) It would seem hard to maintain that
mentality can be completely separate from physicality. And if mentality is
iQdeed connected with certain forms of physicality-apparently intimately
so-then the scientific laws that so accurately describe the behaviour of
physical things must surely have a great deal to say about the world of
mentality also.
   As for viewpoint �. there are problems of a different kind-mainly arising
from its peculiarly speculative character. What reasons are there for believing
that Nature can actually behave in a way that defies computation? Surely the
power of modern science derives, to an ever-increasing degree, from the fact
that physical objects behave in ways that can be simulated, to greater and
greater accuracy, by more and more comprehensive numerical computation.
As scientific understanding has grown, the predictive power of such
computational simulations has increased enormously. In practice, this
increase is largely owed to the rapid development-mainly during the latter
part of this century-of computational devices of extraordinary power, speed,
and accuracy. Thus, there may be seen an increasing closeness between the
activity of modern general-purpose computers and the very action of the
material universe. Are there any indications whatever that this is in any way a
temporary phase in scientific development? Why should one contemplate the
possibility that there can be anything in physical action that is immune from
effective computational treatment?
   If we are looking, within existing physical theory, for signs of an action that
cannot entirely be subjected to computation, then we must come away
disappointed. All the known physical laws, from the particle dynamics of
Newton, via the electromagnetic fields of Maxwell and the curved space-times
of Einstein, to the profound intricacies of the modern quantum theory-all
these seem to be describable in fully computational terms, 1 4 except that an
entirely random ingredient is also involved in the process of 'quantum
measurement' whereby effects of an initially tiny magnitude are magnified
until they can be objectively perceived. None of this contains anything of the
character that would be needed for a 'physical action that cannot even be
properly simulated computationally' of the kind that would be needed for
viewpoint �. Thus, I conclude that it is the 'strong' rather than the 'weak'
version of � that we must follow (cf. §1 .3).
   The importance of this point cannot be stressed too strongly. Various
scientifically minded people have expressed to me their agreement with the
particular view, promoted in ENM, that there must be something 'non­
computational' in the workings of the mind, whilst at the same time they would
claim that one need not look for any revolutionary developments in physical
204           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

theory in order to find such a non-computational action. A possibility that
such people might have in mind would be the extreme complication of the
processes involved in brain action, going far beyond the standard computer
analogy (as first put forward by McCullogh and Pitts in 1943) whereby
neurons or synaptic junctions are taken to be analogous to transistors, and
axons to wires. They might point to the complexity of the chemistry involved
in the behaviour of the neurotransmitter chemicals that govern synaptic
transmission, and to the fact that the action of such chemicals is not necessarily
confined to the vicinity of particular synaptic junctions. Or they might point to
the intricate nature of neurons themselves, 1 5 where important substructures
(such as the cytoskeleton-which will indeed have great importance for us
later; cf. §7.4-§7.7) may well exert a substantial influence on neuronal action.
They might even look to direct electromagnetic influences, such as 'resonance
effects', that might not simply be explained in terms of ordinary nerve
impulses; or they might insist that the effects of quantum theory must be
important in brain action, either in providing a role for quantum uncertainties
or for non-local collective quantum effects (such as the phenomenon known as
'Bose-Einstein condensation' 1 6 ).
   Although definitive mathematical theorems are still largely lacking 1 7 , there
would seem to be no great doubt that all the existing physical theories must
indeed be basically computational in nature-with perhaps an additional
sporadic random ingredient in accordance with the presence of quantum
measurements. Despite this expectation, I believe that the possibility of non­
computational (non-random) activity in physical systems, acting according to
existing physical theory, is still a very interesting question to pursue in detail.
It might yet turn out that there are surprises here, and that some subtle non­
computational ingredient will yet emerge from such detailed mathematical
investigations. As things stand, however, it does not seem to me to be very
likely that genuine non-computability can be found within existing physical
laws. Consequently one must, I believe, probe the weak points in the laws
themselves to find room for the non-computability that the arguments above
demand must be present in human mental activity.
   What are these weak points? There is little doubt in my own mind where we
must concentrate our attack on existing theory; for its weakest link lies in the
above-mentioned procedure of 'quantum measurement'. As existing theory
stands, there are elements of inconsistency-and certainly of controversy-in
relation to the whole existing 'measurement' procedure. It is not even made
clear at what stage this procedure is to be applied, in every given circumstance.
Moreover, the presence of an essential randomness in the procedure itself
provides an apparent physical action of a quite different character from what is
familiar from other fundamental processes. I shall be discussing these matters
at some length in Part II.
   In my own view, this measurement procedure needs fundamental atten­
tion-to the degree that essential changes are needed in the very framework of
              The case for non-computability in mathematical thought          205

physical theory. Some new suggestions will be put forward in Part II (§6. 12).
The reasoning that I have provided in Part I of this book gives strong support
to the possibility that the pure randomness of existing measurement theory
must be replaced by something else, where essentially non-computable
ingredients will play a fundamental role. Moreover, as we shall be seeing later
(§7 .9), this non-computability will have to be of a particularly sophisticated
kind. (For example, a law which 'merely' allows us to decide, by some new
physical process, the truth of TI 1 -sentences-i.e. to solve Turing's 'halting
problem'-would not itself be enough.)
   If the finding of such a sophisticated new physical theory were not a
sufficient challenge in itself, we must also ask for a plausible basis for this
putative physical behaviour to have genuine relevance to brain action­
consistently with the limitations and credibility requirements of existing
knowledge about the organization of the brain. There is no question but that
there must, at the present state of our understanding, be considerable
speculation here also. However, as I shall be pointing out in Part II (§7.4),
there are some genuine possibilities that I was not aware of at the time of
writing of ENM, concerning the cytoskeletal substructure of neurons, that
offer a much greater plausibility for important action at the relevant
quantum/classical borderline than had seemed conceivable before. These
matters, also, will be discussed in Part II (§7.5-§7.7).
   I should again stress that it is not just complication, within the framework of
existing physical theory, that we must seek. Some people would contend that
the involved motions and complex chemical activity of neurotransmitter
substances, for example, could not possibly be adequately simulated, and so
this places the detailed physical action of the brain far beyond effective
computation. However, this is not what I mean here by non-computational
behaviour. It is certainly true that our knowledge of the biological structure
and detailed electrical and chemical mechanisms that together govern brain
action are quite inadequate for any serious attempt at computational
simulation. Moreover, had it even been the case that our present knowledge
were adequate, the computational power of present-day machines and the
status of present-day programming technique would undoubtedly not be up to
performing an appropriate simulation in any reasonable running time. But, in
principle such a simulation could indeed be set up in accordance with existing
models, where the chemistry of neurotransmitter substances, the mechanisms
governing their transport, their effectiveness due to particular ambient
circumstances, action potentials, electromagnetic field, etc., could all be
included in the simulation. Accordingly, mechanisms of this general kind,
assumed to be consistent with the requirements of existing physical theory,
cannot supply the non-computability that the foregoing arguments require.
   There might well be elements of chaotic behaviour in the action of such a
(theoretical) computational simulation. However, as in our earlier discussion
of chaotic systems (§1 .7, §3.10, §3.1 1 , §3.22), we do not demand that the
206           The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

simulation be that of any particular model brain, but that it may merely be
passed off as a 'typical case'. For there is no requirement, in artificial
intelligence, that the mental capabilities of any particular individual be
simulated; one is merely (ultimately) trying to simulate the intelligent
behaviour of some typical individual. (Recall that, as with simulations of
weather systems, in the present type of context, one would be merely
demanding a simulation of a weather, not necessarily the weather!) Once the
mechanisms that underlie the model of the brain that are being put forward are
known, then (provided these mechanisms are consistent with present-day
computational physics) we shall still have a knowable computational
system-perhaps with explicit random ingredients, but all this is already
encompassed within the discussion given above.
   One might even carry this argument further and ask merely that the
proposed model brain be one that has arisen by a process of Darwinian
evolution from primitive forms oflife, all acting according to known physics­
or to any other type of computational model physics (such as the two­
dimensional one provided by John Horton Conway's ingenious mathematical
'game of life' 1 8). We could imagine that a 'robot society', as discussed in §3.5,
§3.9, §3.19, and §3.23, could arise as a result of this Darwinian evolution.
Again, we should have an overall computational system to which the
arguments of §3.14-§3.21 will apply. Now, in order that the concept of '*­
assertion' can have its place within this computational system, so that we can
apply the above arguments in detail, we should need some stage of 'human
intervention' for impressing upon the robots the strict meaning of the
imprimatur '*'. This stage could be triggered off automatically, so as to take
place when the robots begin to achieve appropriate communicational
abilities-as judged by some effective criterion. There seems to be no reason
why all this could not be automated into a knowable computational system (in
the sense that the mechanisms are knowable even though it need not be a
practical matter actually to enact the computation on a foreseeable computer).
As before we derive a contradiction from the supposition that such a system
could reach a level of human understanding sufficient for an appreciation of
GOdel's theorem.
   Another worry that some people have expressed, 1 9 concerning the
relevance to matters of psychology of mathematical arguments like the ones
that I have been relying upon here, is that human mental activity is never so
precise as to be analysed in this way. Such people might well feel that detailed
arguments concerning the mathematical nature of whatever physics might
underlie the activity of our brains can have no real relevance to our
understanding of the actions of the human mind. They might agree that
human behaviour is indeed 'non-computable', but would claim that this
merely reflects a general inappropriateness of considerations of mathematical
physics to questions of human psychology. They might well argue-and not
unreasonably-that the enormously complex organization of our brains, and
               The case for non-computability in mathematical thought            207

also of our society and our education, is far more relevant than any specific
physics that might be responsible for the particular technicalities that happen
to govern detailed human brain functioning.
   However, it is important to stress that mere complexity cannot obviate the
necessity of examining implications of the underlying physical laws. A human
athlete, for example, is an immensely complex physical system, and, by such
argument, one might imagine that the details of the underlying physical laws
would have little relevance to that athlete's performance. Yet we know that
this is very far from the truth. The general physical principles that ensure
conservation of energy, and of momentum and angular momentum, and of the
laws governing the pull of gravity, have as firm a control upon the athlete as a
whole as they have upon the individual particles that compose the athlete's
body. The fact that this must be so arises from very specific features of those
particular principles that happen to govern our particular universe. With even
slightly different principles (or with grossly different ones, such as with
Conway's 'game of life'), the laws that constrain the behaviour of a system of
the complication of an athlete could easily be entirely different. The same can
also be said of the workings of an internal organ such as the heart, and also of
the detailed chemistry that governs innumerable different biological actions.
Likewise, it must be expected that the details of the very laws that underlie
brain action may well be of extreme importance in controlling even the most
gross of the manifestations of human mentality.
   Yet, even accepting all this, it still might well be argued that the particular
type of reasoning that I have been concerned with here, which refers to the
gross ('high-level') behaviour of human mathematicians, would be unlikely to
reflect anything significant about the detailed underlying physics. The
'GOdelian' type of argument, after all, requires a stringently rational attitude
to one's body of 'unassailable' mathematical beliefs, whereas ordinary human
behaviour is hardly ever of the precisely rational kind to which the GOdelian
argument can be applied. For example, it might be pointed out that there are
psychological experiments 20 which show how irrational are the responses of
human subjects to questions such as:
      'if all As are Bs and some Bs are Cs, then does it necessarily follow that
      some As are Cs?'
In examples such as these, a majority of college students gave the wrong
answer ('yes'). If ordinary college students are this illogical in their thinking, it
might well be questioned, then how can we deduce anything of value from the
far more sophisticated GOdelian type of reasoning? Even trained mathemati­
cians will often reason in slipshod ways, and it is infrequently that they express
themselves so consistently that Godelian counter-arguments become relevant.
   However, it should be made clear that such errors as those made by the
college students, in the survey referred to above, are not what the main
arguments of this book are about. Such errors come under the heading of
208            The case for non-computability in mathematical thought

'correctable errors'-and, indeed, the college students' errors would certainly
become clear to them as errors after the nature of those errors has been pointed
out to them (and fully explained to them, if necessary). Correctable errors are
not our real concern here; see the discussion of Q13, particularly, and also
 §3.12 and §3.17. Whereas the study of errors that people make can be
important in psychology, psychiatry, and physiology, I am concerned with a
completely different set of issues here, namely what can be perceived in
principle by the use of human understanding, reasoning, and insight. It turns
out that these issues are indeed subtle ones, though their subtlety is not
immediately apparent. At first, these questions seem to be trivialities; for
correct reasoning is surely just correct reasoning - something more or less
obvious and, in any case, surely all sorted out by Aristotle 2300 years ago (or at
least by the mathematical logician George Boole in 1854, etc.)! But it turns out
that 'correct reasoning' is something immensely subtle and, as Godel (with
Turing) has in effect shown, lies beyond any purely computational action.
These matters have, in the past, been more the territory of mathematicians
than of psychologists, and the subtleties involved have not generally been the
latter's concern. But we have seen that they are issues that inform us about the
ultimate physical actions that must lie at the root of those processes that
underlie our conscious understandings.
    These issues also touch upon deep questions of mathematical philosophy.
Does mathematical understanding represent some kind of contact with a pre­
existing Platonic mathematical reality, which has a timeless actuality quite
independent of ourselves; or are we each independently recreating all
mathematical concepts as we think through our logical arguments? More­
 over, why do physical laws seem so accurately to follow such precise and subtle
mathematical descriptions? How does physical reality itself relate to this issue
 of a Platonic mathematical actuality? Also, if it is indeed true that the nature of
 our perceptions is dependent upon a detailed and subtle mathematical
 substructure underlying the very laws that govern the workings of our brains,
 then what can we learn about how it is that we perceive mathematics-how it
 is that we perceive at all-from a deeper understanding of those physical laws?
    These matters are our ultimate concern, and we shall need to return to them
 at the end of Part II.

12. This is quite an intriguing (and not too complicated) theorem in plane
      Euclidean geometry which is remarkably difficult to prove in a direct way. It
      turns out that one way to prove it is to find an appropriate generalization
      which is a good deal easier, and then to deduce the original result as a special
      case. This type of procedure is quite a common one in mathematics, but it is
      not at all the way in which a computer argument would normally proceed,
      since a considerable ingenuity and insight is required for finding an appropriate
      generalization. In a computer proof, on the other hand, the computer would
      have been provided with a clear-cut system of top-down rules which it would
      then follow remorselessly at enormous speed. A considerable amount of human
      ingenuity would have to have gone into designing the effective top-down rules
      in the first place, however.

                    the Mind

    Does mind have a place in classical
                                physics ?




                 4. 1 The mind and physical laws
We-our bodies and our minds--are part of a universe that obeys, to an
extraordinary accuracy, immensely subtle and broad-ranging mathematical
laws. That our physical bodies are precisely constrained by these laws has
become an accepted part of the modem scientific viewpoint. What about our
minds? Many people find the suggestion deeply unsettling that our minds might
also be constrained to act according to those same mathematical laws. Yet to
have to draw a clean division between body and mind-the one being subject to
the mathematical laws of physics and the other being allowed its own kind of
freedom-would be unsettling in a different way. For our minds surely affect the
ways in which our bodies act, and must also be influenced by the physical state
of those same bodies. The very concept of a mind would appear to have little
purpose if the mind were able neither to have some influence on the physical
body nor to be influenced by it. Moreover, if the mind is merely an 'epi­
phenomenon'---some specific, but passive, feature of the physical state of the
brain-which is a byproduct of the body but which can have no influence back
upon it, then this might seem to allow the mind just an impotent frustrated role.
But if the mind were able to influence the body in ways that cause its body to act
outside the constraints of the laws of physics, then this would disturb the
accuracy of those purely physical scientific laws. It is thus difficult to entertain
the entirely 'dualistic' view that the mind and the body obey totally independent
kinds oflaw. Even if those physical laws that govern the action of the body allow
for a freedom within which the mind may consistently affect its behaviour, then
the particular nature of this freedom must itself be an important ingredient of
those very physical laws. Whatever it is that controls or describes the mind must
indeed be an integral part of the same grand scheme which governs, also, all the
material attributes of our universe.
   There are those 1 who would claim that if we are to refer to 'mind' as though it
were just another kind of substance-though different from matter and
satisfying quite different kinds of principles-we are simply committing a
'category error'. They might point to an analogy, whereby the material body is
214                 Does mind have a place i n classical physics?

to be compared with a physical computer, and the mind with a computer
program. Indeed, such comparisons can be helpful where appropriate, and it is
certainly important to avoid confusions between different kinds of concepts
when such confusion is clearly in evidence. Nevertheless, merely pointing to a
possible 'category error', in the case of mind and body, does not in itself remove
a genuine puzzle.
    Moreover, there are, in physics, certain concepts which can indeed be equated
one with another, where at first sight this would appear to involve something of
a category error. An example of this kind occurs even with Einstein's famous
E = mc 2 , which effectively equates energy with mass. lt might seem that category
error has perhaps been committed here, mass being the measure of actual
material substance, whereas energy seems to be a more nebulous abstract
quantity describing a potentiality for doing work. Yet Einstein's formula, which
relates the two, is a cornerstone of modern physics, and it has been confirmed
experimentally in numerous types of physical process. An even more striking
example of seeming category error, taken from physics, occurs with the concept
of entropy (cf., for example, ENM, Chapter 7). For entropy is defined in a very
subjective way, being essentially a feature of the notion of 'information'; yet
entropy, also, finds itself related to other more 'material' physical quantities in
precise mathematical equations. 2
    Likewise, there seems no reason why we should be forbidden from at least
attempting to discuss the notion of'mind' in terms that might relate it clearly to
other physical concepts. Consciousness, particularly, seems to be something
that is 'there', in association with certain rather specific physical objects-living
wakeful human brains, at least-so we might anticipate some kind of eventual
physical description of this phenomenon, no matter how far from an
understanding of it we may be, at present. The one clue that we have obtained
from the discussion in Part I of this book is that conscious understanding, in
particular, must involve some kind of non-algorithmic physical action-if,
indeed, we are to follow the conclusions that I have been strongly arguing for,
namely something in line with viewpoint 'C, rather than with d, :Ji, or � (cf.
 §1 .3). I must ask any readers who as yet remain unpersuaded by the arguments
that I gave earlier to bear with me, for the time being at least, and see what
territory the case for 'C drives us to explore. We shall find that the possibilities
are by no means as unfavourable as one might have come to expect, and that
there are many things in that territory which are in themselves of interest. I hope
that after following these explorations such readers can return with more
sympathy to the arguments--! believe powerful ones-that I have been putting
forward earlier in this book. Let us thus explore-with 'C as our guide!

 4.2 Computability and chaos in the physics of today
The precision and scope of physical laws, as presently appreciated, is
extraordinary, yet they contain no hint of any action that cannot be simulated
                    Does mind have a place in classical physics?                 215

computationally. Nevertheless, within the possibilities that these laws allow
us, we must try to find an opening for a hidden non-computational action that
the functioning of our brains must somehow be taking advantage of. I shall
defer, for the moment, a discussion of the possible nature of this non­
computability. There are reasons for believing that it must be of a particularly
subtle and elusive kind, and I do not wish to get embroiled, at this stage, with
the issues that will have to be involved. I shall return to the matter later ( §7 .9,
 §7. 10). Suffice it to say that we require something essentially different from the
pictures that we have been presented with in our physical theories so far, either
classical or quantum.
    In classical physics, one can, at any one particular time, specify all the data
needed for defining a physical system, and the future evolution of that system is
not only completely determined by this data but it can also be computed from
it, by the effective methods of Turing computation. At least such computation
can in principle be performed, subject to two (interrelated) provisos. The first
proviso is that it be possible for the initial data to be adequately digitized, so
that the continuous parameters of the theory can be replaced, to a sufficient
degree of approximation, by discrete parameters. (This is in fact what is
normally done in computer simulations of classical systems.) The second
proviso concerns the fact that many physical systems are chaotic-in the sense
that a completely unreasonable accuracy is needed for the data, if the future
behaviour is to be calculated to any tolerable degree of precision. As was
already amply discussed earlier (see §1 .7, in particular; also §3. 10, §3.22)
chaotic behaviour in a discretely operating system does not provide the type of
'non-computability' that is needed here. A chaotic (discrete) system, though
difficult to compute accurately, is still a computable system-as is borne
witness by the fact that such systems are norltlally investigated, in practice, by
means of electronic computers! The first proviso is related to the second,
because the issue of whether or not we consider that the degree of precision of
our discrete approximation to the continuous parameters of the theory is
'adequate' depends, in a chaotic system, upon whether we are concerned with
computing its actual behaviour-or whether a typical behaviour of such a
system will do. If it is just the latter-and as I have argued in Part I, this
appears to be all that we need for the purposes of artificial intelligence-then
we do not need to worry that our discrete approximations are not perfect, and
that small errors in the initial data may lead to very large errors in the
subsequent behaviour of the system. If this is all that we need, then the above
provisos do not seem to allow us room for any serious possibility of a non­
computability of the type required, in accordance with the discussions of Part
I, in any purely classical physical system.
    One should not disregard the possibility, however, that there might be
something in the precise chaotic behaviour exhibited by some continuous
mathematical system (taken as modelling physical behaviour), which cannot
be captured by any discrete approximation. I am not aware of any such
216                Does mind have a place i n classical physics?

system, but even if such a system exists, it would be of no help to Al-as that
subject stands at the moment-because existing AI indeed depends upon
modelling by discrete computation (that is, by digital rather than analogue
computation; cf. §1 .8).
  In quantum physics, there is also some additional freedom of a completely
random nature, over and above the deterministic (and computable) behaviour
that the equations of quantum theory (basically, the Schrodinger equation)
provide. Technically, these equations are not chaotic, but the absence of chaos
is replaced by the presence of the aforesaid random ingredients that
supplement the deterministic evolution. As we have seen, in §3. 1 8 particularly,
such purely random ingredients do not supply the needed non-algorithmic
action either. Thus it appears that neither classical nor quantum physics, as
presently understood, allows room for non-computable behaviour of the type
required, so we must look elsewhere for our needed non-computable action.


       4.3 Consciousness : new physics or 'emergent
                              phenomenon'?
In Part I, I argued (in the particular case of mathematical understanding) that
the phenomenon of consciousness can arise only in the presence of some non­
computational physical processes taking place in the brain. One must
presume, however, that such (putative) non-computational processes would
also have to be inherent in the action of inanimate matter, since living human
brains are ultimately composed of the same material, satisfying the same
physical laws, as are the inanimate objects of the universe. We must therefore
ask two things. First, why is it that the phenomenon of consciousness appears
to occur, as far as we know, only in (or in relation to) brains-although we
should not rule out the possibility that consciousness might be present also in
other appropriate physical systems? Second, we must ask how could it be that
such a seemingly important (putative) ingredient as non-computational
behaviour, presumed to be inherent-potentially, at least-in the actions of all
material things, so far has entirely escaped the notice of physicists?
   No doubt the answer to the first question has something to do with the
subtle and complex organization of the brain, but that, alone, would not
provide a sufficient explanation. In accordance with the ideas I am putting
forward here, the brain's organization would have to be geared to take
advantage of non-computable action in physical laws, whereas ordinary
materials would not be so organized. This picture differs markedly from a
more commonly expressed view about the nature of consciousness 3 (basically
that of d) according to which conscious awareness would be some kind of
'emergent phenomenon', arising merely as a feature of sufficient complexity or
sophistication of action, and would not require any specific, new, underlying
physical processes, fundamentally different from those that we are already
                    Does mind have a place in classical physics?              217

familiar with in the behaviour of inanimate matter. The case presented in Part
I argues differently, and it requires that there must be some subtle organization
in the brain which is specifically tuned to take advantage of the suggested non­
computable physics. I shall have more detailed comments to make about the
nature of this organization later (§7.4-§7.7).
   With regard to the second question, we must indeed expect that vestiges of
such non-computability should also be present, at some indiscernible level, in
inanimate matter. Yet the physics of ordinary matter seems, at first sight at
least, to allow no room for such non-computable behaviour. Later on, I shall
try to explain, in some detail, how such non-computable behaviour could
indeed have escaped attention, and how such behaviour is compatible with
present-day observations. But for the moment it will be helpful to describe a
quite different but, in its way, closely analogous phenomenon from known
physics. Although not connected-or, at least, not directly connected-with
any kind of non-computable behaviour, this known physical phenomenon is
very much like our putative non-computable ingredient in other ways, being
totally indiscernible-though actually present-in the detailed behaviour of
ordinary objects; yet it does make its appearance at an appropriate level, and,
as it turns out, has profoundly altered the way that we understand the
workings of the world. Our story is, in fact, one that has been central to the
very march of science.


                          4.4 The Einstein tilt
Since the time of Isaac Newton, the physical phenomenon of gravity, and its
superbly precise mathematical description (first put forward by Newton fully
in 1687), has played a key role in the development of scientific thought. Once
this mathematical description was established, gravity served as a beautiful
model for the description of other physical processes, where the motions of
bodies through a fixed (flat) background space were perceived as precisely
controlled by the forces that act upon those bodies, the forces operating as a
mutual attraction (or repulsion) between individual particles, controlling all
their motions in finest detail. As a result of the outstanding success of Newton's
gravitional theory, it was consequently believed that all physical processes
could be described in this way, where electrical, magnetic, molecular, and
other forces also act between particles and control their precise motions, in the
same general way as had been seen to work so wonderfully in the case of
gravity.
   In 1865, this picture was strikingly modified when the great Scottish
physicist James Clerk Maxwell published a remarkable set of equations
describing the precise behaviour of electric and magnetic fields. These
continuous fields were now, themselves, to have an independent existence
alongside the various discrete particles. The electromagnetic field (as the
218                 Does mind have a place i n classical physics?

combination of the two is now referred to) is capable of carrying energy across
otherwise empty space, in the form oflight, radio waves, or X-rays, etc., and it
has a reality just as great as the Newtonian particles with which it is taken to
co-exist. Nevertheless, the general description is still of physical bodies
(including, now, the continuous fields) that move about in a fixed space under
the influence of their mutual interactions, so the broad picture presented by
the Newtonian scheme was not substantially altered. Even quantum theory,
with all its revolutionary strangeness, as introduced in 1913-26 by Niels Bohr,
Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrodinger, Paul Dirac, and others, did not
change this aspect of our physical world-view. Physical objects were still taken
to be things mutually acting upon one another through fields of force,
everything inhabiting this one and the same fixed, flat, background.
   Concurrently with some of the early developments in quantum theory,
Albert Einstein deeply re-examined the very basis of Newtonian gravity and
finally, in 1915, came up with a revolutionary new theory which provided a
totally different picture: his general theory of relativity (cf. ENM, pp. 202-1 1 ).
Now, gravity was no longer to be a force at all, but it was to be represented as a
kind of curvature of the very space (actually space-time) in which all the other
particles and forces were to be housed.
   Not all physicists were very happy with this unsettling view. They felt that
gravity should not be treated so differently from all other physical actions­
especially since gravity itself had provided the initial paradigm, on which all
later theories of physics had been modelled. Another worry was that gravity is
extraordinarily weak, as compared with other physical forces. For example,
the gravitational force between the electron and the proton in a hydrogen
atom is smaller than the electric force between the same two particles by a
factor of about

             1/28 500000000000000000000000000000000000000.
Thus, gravity is just not noticeable at all, at the level of the individual particles
that constitute matter!
   A question that would be sometimes raised was: might not gravitation be
some kind of residual effect, perhaps arising out of the almost complete, but
not quite exact, cancellation of all the other forces involved? (Certain forces of
this actual nature are known, such as the van der Waals force, hydrogen bond,
and London force.) Accordingly, rather than being a quite different physical
phenomenon from everything else, having to be described in a completely
different mathematical way from all other forces, gravity would not really exist
at all as something in its own right, but would be some kind of 'emergent
phenomenon'. (For example, the great Soviet scientist and humanitarian
Andrei Sakharov once put forward a view of gravity of this nature.4)
   However, it turns out that this kind of idea will not work. The basic reason
for this is that gravity actually influences the causal relationships between

space-time events, and it is the only physical quantity that has this effect.
Another way of phrasing this is to say that gravity has the unique capacity to
'tilt' the light cones. (We shall see what all this means in a moment.) No
physical field other than gravity can tilt the light cones, nor can any collection
whatever of non-gravitational physical influences.
    What does 'tilting the light cones' mean? What are 'causal relations between
space-time events'? We shall need to digress a little in order to explain these
terms. (This digression will have a separate importance for us later.) Some
readers may well be familiar with the relevant concepts already, and I shall
give only a brief account here in order to acquaint the others with the
necessary ideas. (See ENM, Chapter 5, p. 194 for a more complete discussion.)
In Fig. 4.1 , I have pictured, in a space-time diagram, an ordinary light cone.
Time is depicted in the diagram as progressing from the bottom of the page to
the top, while space is depicted as extending horizontally. A point in a
space-time diagram represents an event, which is some particular spatial point
at some particular moment. Events, therefore, have zero temporal duration as
well as having zero spatial extension. The complete light cone centred at an
event P represents the space-time history of a spherical pulse of light, which
implodes inwards upon P, and at that moment explodes out again from P,
always with the speed of light. Thus, the entire light cone of P is composed of
all those light rays that actually encounter the event P in their individual
histories.
220                   Does mind have a place in classical physics?

   The light cone of P has two parts to it, the past light cone * representing the
imploding light flash, and the future light cone, representing the exploding
flash. According to relativity theory, all the events that can have a causal'
influence on a space-time event P are those that lie either within or on the past
light cone of P; likewise, all the events that can be causally influenced by P are
those lying either within or on the future light cone ofP. The events lying in the
region outside both the past and future cones are those which can neither
influence nor be influenced by P. Such events are said to be spacelike separated
from P.
   It should be made clear that these notions of causal relationship are features
of relativity theory, and they are not pertinent to Newtonian physics. In the
Newtonian picture, there is no limiting speed for the transfer of information. It
is only in relativity theory that there is such a limiting speed, and that speed is
the speed of light. It is a fundamental principle of the theory that no causal
effect may proceed more swiftly than this limiting speed.
   One must be somewhat cautious in the interpretation of what is meant by
'the speed oflight' here, however. Actual light signals are slowed down slightly
when they pass through a refracting medium, such as glass. Within such a
medium, the speed at which a physical light signal would travel would be
slower than what we are here calling 'the speed oflight', and it is possible for a
physical body, or for a physical signal other than a light signal, to exceed the
 actual speed at which light would travel in such a medium. Such a
phenomenon can be observed, in certain physical experiments, in the
circumstance of what is known as Cerenkov radiation. Here particles are fired
into a refracting medium, where the speed of the particles is only very slightly
less than this absolute 'speed of light' but is greater than the speed at which
light actually travels in the medium. Shock waves of actual light occur, and
this is the Cerenkov radiation.
   To avoid confusion, it is best that I refer to this greater 'speed of light' as the
absolute speed. The light cones in space-time determine the absolute speed,
 but do not necessarily determine the speed of actual light. In the medium the
 speed of actual light is somewhat less than the absolute speed, and is less also
 than that ofthe particles fired into it that produce Cerenkov radiation. It is the
 absolute speed (i.e. each light cone) that fixes the speed limit for all signals or
material bodies, and although actual light does not necessarily travel at the
 absolute speed, it always does so in a vacuum.
   The 'relativity' theory that we are basically referring to here is special
 relativity, where gravity is absent. The light cones in special relativity are all
 arranged uniformly, as depicted in Fig. 4.2, and the space-time is referred to as
 Minkowski space. According to Einstein's general relativity, the previous
 discussion still holds good, so long as we continue to refer to the 'absolute
 speed' as being that determined by the space-time situation of the light cones.
         *In the diagrams of ENM, only the future parts of the light cones were depicted.

However, it is an effect of gravity that the light cones can become non-uniform
in their distribution, as depicted in Fig. 4.3. This is what I have referred to as
the 'tilting' of the light cones, above.
   A not uncommon way of trying to think about this light-cone tilting is in
terms of a speed of light--or, rather, of an absolute speed-that varies from
place to place, where this speed may also be dependent upon the direction of

motion. In this way one might now try to think of the 'absolute speed' as
something analogous to the 'speed of actual light' that was referred to in the
above discussion of the refracting medium. Accordingly, one might try to
think of the gravitational field as providing a kind of all-pervading refracting
medium which affects the behaviour not only of actual light, but also of all
material particles and signals. * Indeed, this sort of a description of the effects
of gravity has often been attempted, and it works to some degree. However, it
is not an altogether satisfactory description and, in certain important respects,
gives a seriously misleading picture of general relativity.
   In the first place, although this 'gravitational refracting medium' can often
be taken to provide a slowing down of the absolute speed, as is the case with a
normal refracting medium, there are important circumstances (such as the
very distant gravitational field of an isolated mass) in which this alone does not
work, and the putative medium would also have to be able to speed up the
absolute speed at certain places (Penrose 1980; cf. Fig. 4.4). This is not
something that could be achieved within the framework of special relativity.
According to that theory, a refractive medium, no matter how exotic, could
never have the effect of being able to speed up signals to faster than the speed of
light in medium-free vacuum, without violating the basic causality principles
of the theory-for such a speeding up would allow signals to be propagated
outside the (medium-free) Minkowskian light cones, which is not allowed. In
particular, the 'light-cone-tilting' effects of gravity, as described above, cannot
be interpreted as some residual effect of other non-gravitational fields.
   There are certain much more extreme situations in which it would not be

possible to describe light-cone tilting in this kind of way at all, even if we
allowed the absolute speed to be 'speeded up' in some directions. In Fig. 4.5 a
situation is illustrated where this is indeed not possible, the light cones being
tilted right over to an absurd-looking degree. In fact, this kind of extreme
tilting need only arise in the distinctly questionable situations where 'causality
violation' occurs-where it becomes theoretically possible for an observer to
send signals into his * own past (cf. Fig. 7.15, in Chapter 7). Remarkably,
considerations of this nature will have some genuine relevance to our later
discussion (§7. 10)!
   There is also the more subtle point that the 'degree of tilt' of a single light
cone is not something physically measurable, and so it does not really make
any physical sense to treat it as an actual slowing down or speeding up of the
absolute speed. This is best illustrated if we think of Fig. 4.3 as a picture drawn
on a rubber sheet, so any particular light cone can, in the neighbourhood of its
vertex, be rotated and distorted (cf. Fig. 4.6) until it sits 'vertically', just as in
the normal Minkowski space pictures of special relativity (Fig. 4.2). There is
        *Of course 'his' does not imply 'male'; cf. Notes to the reader on p. xvi.
224                  Does mind have a place in classical physics?

no way to tell, by means of any local experiments, whether or not the light cone
at any particular event is 'tilted' . If we were to think ofthe tilting effect as really
due to a 'gravitational medium' then we should need to explain why this
medium has the very curious effect that it is unobservable at any single
space-time event. In particular, even the apparently extreme situations
illustrated in Fig. 4.5 for which the gravitational medium idea will not work at
all are, if we consider just a single light cone, physically no different from what
happens in a situation, like in Minkowski space, where that light cone is not
tilted at all.
   In general, however, we can rotate a particular light cone to its
Minkowskian orientation only at the expense of having some of its
neighbouring light cones distorted away from their Minkowskian orienta­
tions. There is, in general, a 'mathematical obstruction' that renders it
impossible to deform the rubber sheet so as to bring all the light cones into the
standard Minkowskian arrangement illustrated in Fig. 4.2. For four­
dimensional space-time, this obstruction is described by a mathematical
object called the Weyl conformal tensor-for which the notation WEYL was
used in ENM (cf. ENM, p. 210). (The tensor WEYL describes just half of the
information-the 'conformal' half-that is contained in the full Riemann
curvature tensor of space-time; however, there is no need for the reader to be
concerned with the meanings of these terms here.) Only if WEYL is zero can
we rotate all the light cones into the Minkowskian arrangement. The tensor
WEYL measures the gravitational field-in the sense of the gravitational tidal
distortion--so it is precisely the gravitational field, in this sense, that provides
the obstruction to being able to 'untilt' the light cones.
   This tensor quantity is certainly physically measurable. The WEYL
gravitational field of the moon, for example, exerts its tidal distortion on the
earth-giving the main contribution to the origin of the earth's tides (ENM,
p. 204, Fig. 5.25). This effect does not directly relate to the tilting oflight cones,
however, being a feature merely of the Newtonian effects of gravity. More
pertinent is another observational effect, gravitational lensing, which is a
characteristic feature of Einstein's theory. The first observed example of
gravitational lensing was that seen by Arthur Eddington's expedition to the
island of Principe in 1919, where the distortion of the observed background
field of stars by the gravitational field of the sun was carefully noted. The local
distortion of this background field has the nature that a small circular pattern
in the actual background would be distorted into an elliptical observed one
(see Fig. 4.7). This is an almost direct observation of the effects of WEYL on
the light-cone structure of space-time. In recent times, the gravitational
lensing effect has become a very important tool in observational astronomy
and cosmology. The light from a distant quasar is sometimes distorted by the
presence of an intervening galaxy (Fig. 4.8), and the observed distortions ofthe
appearance of the quasar, together with time-delay effects, can give important
information about distances, masses, etc. All this provides clear-cut observa-

tional evidence for light-cone tilting as an actual phenomenon, and also for the
directly measurable effects of WEYL.
   The foregoing remarks illustrate the fact that the 'tilting' of light cones, i.e.
the distortion of causality, due to gravity, is not only a subtle phenomenon,
but a real phenomenon, and it cannot be explained away by a residual or
'emergent' property that arises when conglomerations of matter get large
enough. Gravity has its own unique character among physical processes, not
directly discernible at the level of the forces that are important for fundamental
particles, but nevertheless it is there all the time. Nothing in known physics
other than gravity can tilt the light cones, so gravity is something that is simply
226                 Does mind have a place in classical physics?

different from all other known forces and physical influences, in this very basic
respect. According to classical general relativity theory, there must indeed be
an absolutely minute amount of light-cone tilting resulting from the material
in the tiniest speck of dust. Even individual electrons must tilt the light cones.
But the amount of tilting in such objects is far too ridiculously tiny to have any
directly noticeable effect whatsoever.
   Effects of gravity have been observed between objects a good deal larger
than specks of dust, but still a lot smaller than the moon. In a famous
experiment performed in 1798, Henry Cavendish measured the gravitational
attraction of a sphere of mass about 105 grams. (His experiment was based on
an earlier one by John Michell.) With modern technology, it is possible to
detect the gravitational pull of an object whose mass is much smaller. (See e.g.
Cooke 1988.) However, any detection of the light-cone tilting effect of gravity
in any ofthese situations would be totally beyond present-day techniques. lt is
only with very large masses indeed that light-cone tilting can be directly
observed; whereas its actual presence in very tiny amounts in bodies as small
as specks of dust is a clear-cut implication of Einstein's theory.
   The detailed effects of gravity cannot be simulated by any combination of
other physical fields or forces whatever. Gravitation's precise effects have a
completely unique character, and there is no way that it can be regarded as an
emergent or secondary phenomenon, residual to other much more prominent
physical processes. It is described by the very structure of the space-time that
had previously been seen as the fixed background arena for all other physical
activity. In the Newtonian universe, gravity was seen as nothing special-even
providing the paradigm for all the later physical forces. Yet, in the Einsteinian
one (which is the marvellously observationally confirmed viewpoint that is
held by physicists today), gravity is seen as something completely different:
not an emergent phenomenon at all, but something with its own special
character.
   Yet despite the fact that gravity is different from other physical forces, there
is a profound harmony integrating gravity with all of the rest of physics.
Einstein's theory is not something foreign to the other laws, but it presents
them in a different light. (This is particularly so for the laws of conservation of
energy, momentum, and angular momentum.) This integration of Einstein's
gravity with the rest of physics goes some way to explaining the irony that
Newton's gravity had provided a paradigm for the rest of physics despite the
fact, as Einstein later showed, that gravity is actually different from the rest of
physics ! Above all, Einstein taught us not to get too complacent in believing,
 at any stage of our understanding, that we have, as yet, necess�rily found the
 appropriate physical viewpoint.
    May we expect that there is something corresponding to be learnt with
regard to the phenomenon of consciousness? If so, it would not be mass that
 would need to be large for the phenomenon to become apparent-at least not
 only mass-but some kind of delicate physical organization. According to the
                    Does mind have a place in classical physics?              227

arguments put forward in Part I, such organization would have to have found
a way of making use of some hidden non-computational ingredient already
present in the behaviour of ordinary matter-an ingredient that, like the light­
cone tilting of general relativity, would have totally escaped attention had that
attention been confined to the study of the behaviour of tiny particles.
   But does light-cone tilting have anything to do with non-computabilty? We
shall explore an intriguing aspect of this question in §7 . 10; but at the present
stage of argument, nothing whatsoever-except that it provides us with a
moral: namely, that it is quite possible, in physics, to have a fundamentally
important new property, completely different from any that had been
contemplated hitherto, hidden unobserved in the behaviour of ordinary
matter. Einstein was led to his revolutionary viewpoint from a number of
powerful considerations, some mathematically sophisticated, and some
physically subtle-but the most important of these had lain prominent, but
unappreciated, since the time of Galileo (the principle of equivalence: all
bodies fall at the same speed in a gravitational field). Moreover, it was a
necessary prerequisite for the success of Einstein's ideas that they should be
compatible with all that was known in the physical phenomena of his day.
   In an analogous way, we may contemplate that there could be some non­
computational action hidden somewhere in the behaviour of things. For such
a speculation to have a hope of success, it would also have to be motivated by
powerful considerations, presumably both mathematically sophisticated and
physically subtle, and it would have to be consistent with all the detailed
physical phenomena that are known today. We shall try to see how far we can
get along the road to such a theory.
   But as a prerequisite, let us first glimpse the powerful hold that
computational ideas have on present-day physics. With appropriate irony, we
shall find that general relativity itself provides one of Nature's most striking
examples.



                  4.5 Computation and physics
Some 30 000 light years distant from the earth, in the constellation of Aquila,
two incredibly dense dead stars orbit about each other. The material of these
objects is so compressed that a tennis ball of their substance would have a mass
comparable with that of Mars's moon Deimos. These two stars--called
neutron stars--circle about each other once every 7 hours, 45 minutes, and
6.98 1 6132 seconds, and they have masses that are, respectively, 1 .441 1 and
1 .3874 times the mass of our sun (with a possible error of about 7 in the last
decimal place). The first of these stars emits a pulse of electromagnetic
radiation (radio waves) in our direction once every 59 milliseconds, indicating
that it is rotating about its axis some 17 times in a second. It is what is

known as a pulsar, and the pair constitute the famous binary pulsar system
PSR 1913 + 16.
   Pulsars have been known since 1967, when they were discovered by Joselyn
Bell and Anthony Hewish at the Cambridge radio observatory. They are
remarkable objects. Neutron stars result, normally, from the gravitational
collapse of the core of a red giant star, which may produce a violent supernova
explosion. They are almost unbelievably dense, being compacted out of
nuclear particles, mainly neutrons, to such a degree that their overall density is
comparable with that of the neutron itself. In the collapse, the neutron star
would have trapped flux lines of a magnetic field within its substance and,
owing to the enormous compression arising as the star collapsed, would have
concentrated this field to an extraordinary degree. The magnetic field lines
would emerge from the star's north magnetic pole and, after reaching
outwards considerable distances into space, would return into the star at its
south magnetic pole (see Fig. 4.9).
   The star's collapse would have resulted in its rate of rotation, also, being
enormously increased (an effect of conservation of angular momentum). In the
case of our pulsar referred to above (which would be about 20 kilometres in
diameter), this rate is some 17 times a second! This results in the pulsar's
extremely strong magnetic field being swung around it at 17 times a second,
since the flux lines within the star remain pinned to the body of the star.
Outside the star, the field lines carry charged particles around with them, but
at a certain distance out from the star, the speed at which these particles must
move approaches, closely, the speed oflight. Where this happens, the charged
particles start to radiate violently, and the powerful radio waves that they emit
are beaconed, as by a gigantic lighthouse, to enormous distances. Some of
these signals reach earth, as the beacon's beam repeatedly flashes past, to be

observed by astronomers as the succession of radio 'clicks' that is character­
istic of a pulsar (Fig. 4. 10).
   Pulsars' rotation rates are extremely stable, and they provide clocks whose
accuracy matches, or even exceeds, the most perfect (nuclear) clocks that have
been constructed here on earth. (A good pulsar clock might lose or gain less
than about 10- 1 2 seconds in a year.) If the pulsar happens to be part of a
binary system, as is the case with PSR 1913 + 16, then its orbiting motion
about its companion can be closely monitored by use of the Doppler effect
whereby the rate of its 'clicking', as received here on earth, is slightly greater
when the pulsar approaches us than it is when it recedes from us.
   In the case of PSR 1913 + 16, it has been possible to get an extraordinarily
precise picture of the mutual orbits that the two stars actually execute about
one another, and to check a number of different observational predictions of
Einstein's general relativity. These include an effect known as 'perihelion
advance'-which, in the late 1 800s, had been noticed as an anomalous
behaviour for the planet Mercury in its orbital motion about the sun, but
which Einstein explained in 1916, giving the first test of his theory-and
various types of general-relativistic 'wobble' that affect rotation axes, etc.
Einstein's theory gives a very clear-cut (deterministic and computable) picture
ofthe way that two small bodies should behave, as they move about in mutual
orbit around one another, and it is possible to compute this motion to a high
order of accuracy, using careful and sophisticated methods of approximation
as well as various standard computational techniques. There are certain
unknown parameters involved in such a computation, such as the masses and
initial motions of the stars, but there is ample data from the pulsar signals to
allow these to be fixed to excellent accuracy. The overall agreement between
the computed picture and the finely detailed information that is received in the
230                 Does mind have a place in classical physics?

form ofthe pulsar signals is very remarkable, and it provides good support for
general relativity.
   There is one further effect of general relativity that I have not referred to as
yet, and which plays an important role in the dynamics of the binary pulsar:
gravitational radiation. I have been emphasizing, in the previous section, how
gravity differs in important ways from all other physical fields. But there are
other respects in which gravity and electromagnetism are closely similar. One
of the important properties of electromagnetic fields is that they can exist in
wave form, propagating through space as light or radio waves. According to
classical Maxwell theory, such waves would emanate from any system of
mutually orbiting charged particles interacting with each other through
electromagnetic forces. Likewise, according to classical general relativity,
there would be gravitational waves emanating from any system of gravitating
bodies in mutual orbit about one another through their mutual gravitational
interactions. In the normal way of things, th�se waves would be extremely
weak. The most powerful source of gravitational radiation in the solar system
arises from the motion of the planet Jupiter about the sun, but the amount of
energy that the Jupiter-sun system emits in this form is only about that of a 40
watt light bulb !
   However, in other circumstances, such as with PSR 1913 + 16, the situation
is very different, and gravitational radiation from the system indeed has a
significant role to play. Here, Einstein's theory provides a firm prediction of
the detailed nature of the gravitational radiation that the system ought to be
emitting, and of the energy that should be carried away. This loss of energy
should result in a slow spiralling inwards of the two neutron stars, and a
corresponding speeding up oftheir orbital rotation period. Joseph Taylor and
Russell Hulse first observed this binary pulsar at the enormous Aricebo radio
telescope in Puerto Rico in 1974. Since that time, the rotation period has been
closely monitored by Taylor and his colleagues, and the speed-up is in precise
agreement with the expectations of general relativity (cf. Fig. 4.1 1 ). For this
work, Hulse and Taylor were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize for Physics. In
fact, as the years have rolled by, the accumulation of data from this system has
provided a stronger and stronger confirmation of Einstein's theory. Indeed, if
we now take the system as a whole and compare it with the behaviour that is
computed from Einstein's theory as a whole-from the Newtonian aspects of
the orbits, through the corrections to these orbits from standard general
relativity effects, right up to the effects on the orbits due to loss of energy in
gravitational radiation-we find that the theory is confirmed overall to an
error of no more than about 10- 1 4• This makes Einstein's general relativity, in
this particular sense, the most accurately tested theory known to science!
   In this example, we have a particularly 'clean' system, where general
 relativity, alone, is all that need be involved in the calculation. Such things as
complications resulting from the internal constitution of the bodies, or drag
due to an intervening medium or due to magnetic fields, have no significant

effect on the motions. Moreover, there are only two bodies involved, together
with their mutual gravitational field, so it is well feasible to make a thorough
computation of the expected behaviour, according to the theory, complete in
every relevant detail. This may well be the most perfect example of a
comparison between a computed theoretical model and observed behav­
iour-involving only a few bodies-that has been yet achieved in science.
   When the number of bodies in a physical system is considerably greater than
this, it may still be possible, using the full resources of modern computer
technology, to model the system's behaviour in as thoroughly detailed a way.
In particular, the motions of all the planets in the solar system, together with
their most significant moons, have been modelled in a very detailed
comprehensive calculation by Irwin Shapiro and his colleagues. This provides
another important test of general relativity. Again Einstein's theory fits all the
observational data, and it accommodates the various small deviations from
the observed behaviour that would have been present had a completely
Newtonian treatment been used.
   Calculations involving an even larger number of bodies-sometimes of the
order of a million-{;an also be carried out with modern computers, although
these would generally (but not always) be based entirely on Newtonian theory.
Certain simplifying assumptions might have to be made about how to

approximate the effects of many particles by some kind of averaging, rather
than having to compute absolutely every particle's effect on every other
particle. Such calculations are common in astrophysics, where one may be
concerned with the detailed formation of stars or galaxies, or the clumping
together of matter in the early universe prior to galaxy formation.
   There is, however, an important difference in what these calculations are
trying to achieve. Now, we are not likely to be so much concerned with the
actual evolution of some system, but with a typical evolution. As with our
earlier considerations of chaotic systems, this may be the best that we can
expect to do. It is possible, by such means, to test various scientific hypotheses
about the constitution and initial distribution of material in the universe to see
how well, in a general way, its resulting evolution fits with what is actually
observed. One does not, in such circumstances, expect to find a detailed fit, but
general appearances and various detailed statistical parameters can be
checked between model and observation.
   The extreme situation of this kind accurs when the number of particles is so
large that it becomes a hopeless matter to follow the evolution of each of them
individually, and instead the particles must be treated in an entirely statistical
way. The ordinary mathematical treatment of a gas, for example, deals with
statistical ensembles of different possible collections of particle motions, and it
is not concerned with the particular motions of individual particles. Such
physical quantities as temperature, pressure, entropy, etc., are properties of
such ensembles, but again they can be treated as part of a computational
system, where the evolutionary properties of these ensembles are treated from
a statistical point of view.
   In addition to the relevant dynamical equations (Newton's, Maxwell's,
Einstein's, or whatever) there is, in such circumstances, another physical
principle that must be involved. This is the second law of thermodynamics. 5 In
effect, this law serves to rule out initial states of the individual particle motions
that would lead to overwhelmingly improbable, though dynamically possible,
future evolutions. The introduction of the second law serves to ensure that the
future evolution of the system being modelled is indeed 'typical', rather than
something grossly atypical which has no practical relevance to the problem at
hand. With the aid of the second law, it becomes possible to compute future
evolutions of systems where there are so many particles involved that a
detailed treatment of individual motions can in no way be achieved in practice.
   It is an interesting question-and indeed a profound one-why such
evolutions cannot be carried out reliably into the past, despite the fact that the
dynamical equations of Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein are all completely
symmetrical in time; for in the real world, the second law does not apply in the
reverse direction in time. The ultimate reason for this has to do with the very
special conditions that held at the beginning of time-the big bang origin of
the universe. (See ENM, Chapter 7, for a discussion of these matters.) In fact,
these initial conditions were so precisely special that they provide yet another
                    Does mind have a place in classical physics?                233

example of the extraordinary precision whereby observed physical behaviour
is modelled by clear-cut mathematical hypotheses.
   In the case of the big bang, an essential part ofthe relevant hypotheses is that
in its very early stages, the matter content of the universe was in a state of
thermal equilibrium. What does 'thermal equilibrium' mean? The study of
thermal equilibrium states represents the opposite extreme from the precise
modelling of the detailed motions ofjust a few objects, such as in the case of the
binary pulsar above. Now, it is just 'typical behaviour' in its purest and most
reliable sense that is one's concern. An equilibrium state, generally, is a state of
a system which has completely 'settled down', and the system will not deviate
significantly from that state, even if disturbed slightly. For a system with a
large number of particles (or a large number of degrees of freedom}-so that
one is concerned not with detailed individual particle motions but with
averaged behaviour and average measures such as temperature and pres­
sure-this is the thermal equilibrium state to which the system ultimately
converges, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics (maximum
entropy). The qualification 'thermal' implies that there is some kind of
averaging over the large numbers of alternative individual particle motions
involved. It is the subject of thermodynamics that is concerned with such
averages-i.e. with typical rather than individual behaviour.
   Strictly speaking, in accordance with what has been said earlier, when we
refer to the thermodynamical state of a system or to thermal equilibrium, this
does not pertain to an individual state, but rather to an ensemble of states, all
of which appear the same on a macroscopic scale (and the entropy, roughly
speaking, is the logarithm of the number of states in this ensemble). In the case
of a gas in equilibrium, if we fix the pressure, volume, and the amount and
composition of the gas particles, we obtain a very specific distribution of the
probable particle velocities at thermal equilibrium (as first described by
Maxwell). A more detailed analysis reveals a scale at which statistical
fluctuations away from the idealized thermal equilibrium state are to be
expected-and here we begin to enter the more sophisticated areas of the study
of the statistical behaviour of matter, which goes under the heading of
statistical mechanics.
   Again, it appears that there is nothing essentially non-computable about the
modelling of physical behaviour by mathematical structures. When the
appropriate calculations have been made, there is good agreement between
what is calculated and what is observed. However, when systems more
complicated than dilute gases or of large collections of gravitating bodies are
considered, it is not likely that one can steer entirely clear of the issues raised
by the quantum-mechanical nature of the materials concerned. In particular, in
the purest and most precisely tested example of thermodynamic behaviour­
the thermal equilibrium state of matter and radiation known as a black-body
state-this cannot be treated entirely classically, and it turns out that quantum
processes are fundamentally involved. Indeed, it was Max Planck's analysis of

black-body radiation in 1900 that initiated the whole subject of quantum
theory.
   Nevertheless, the predictions of physical theory (now quantum theory) are
triumphantly verified. The observed relationship between frequency and the
intensity of the radiation at that frequency agrees, in experiments, very closely
with the mathematical formula put forward by Planck. Although this section
has been really concerned with the computational nature of classical theory, I
cannot resist showing you what is by far the most perfect example of
agreement between observation and Planck's formula that I know of. This
example also provides a wonderful observational confirmation of the standard
model of the big bang, with regard to what it asserts should be the precise
thermal conditions existing in the universe after the first few minutes of its
existence. In Fig. 4.12, the individual small boxed points indicate the various
observed values of the intensity of the cosmic background radiation at
different frequencies, as observed by the COBE satellite; the continuous curve
is drawn according to Planck's formula, taking the temperature of the
radiation to have the (best-fit) value of 2.735( ± 0.06) K. The precision of the
agreement is extraordinary.
   The specific examples that I have referred to above were taken from the area
of astrophysics, where the comparison between complicated computations
and the observed behaviour of systems occurring in the natural world is
particularly well developed. One cannot directly experiment in astrophysics,
so theories have to be tested by comparing the results of detailed computations
based on standard physical laws, in different proposed situations, with
sophisticated observations. (These observations may be ground based, or
made from balloons or aircraft in the upper atmosphere, or from rockets or
satellites; and they involve many different kinds of detectors in addition to
ordinary telescopes.) Such computations are not specifically relevant to those
that would be our concern here, and I have mentioned them mainly because
                      Does mind have a place in classical physics?              235

they provide particularly clear-cut examples in which detailed computations
provide a wonderful way of exploring Nature, illustrating how closely
computational procedures can indeed mimic Nature. It is the study of
biological systems that should, on the other hand, be more directly our
concern here. For, in accordance with the conclusions of Part I, it is in the
behaviour of conscious brains that we should seek a role for some non­
computable physical action.
   It is undoubtedly the case that computational models play important roles
in the modelling of biological systems, but the systems are likely to be much
more complicated than they are in astrophysics, and the computational
models correspondingly harder to make reliable. There are very few systems
that are 'clean' enough for any great accuracy to be achieved. Comparatively
simple systems, such as with the flow of blood along different types of blood
vessel, can be modelled quite effectively, and so also can the transmission of
signals along nerve fibres-although in the latter case it is beginning to
become a little unclear that the problem remains one of classical physics,
because chemical actions are important here, as well as classical physical ones.
   Chemical actions are the result of quantum effects, and strictly speaking one
has left the arena of classical physics when considering processes that are
dependent upon chemistry. This notwithstanding, it is very commonly the
case that such quantum-based actions are treated in an essentially classical
way. Although this is not technically correct, it is felt that in most cases the
more subtle effects of quantum theory-over and above those which can be
subsumed into the standard rules of chemistry, classical physics, and
geometry-are not of relevance. It seems to me, on the other hand, that
whereas this may be a reasonably safe procedure for the modelling of many
biological systems (perhaps even nerve-signal propagation), it is risky to try to
draw general conclusions about the more subtle of biological actions on the
basis of their being entirely classical, particularly when it comes to the most
sophisticated of biological systems such as human brains. If we try to make
general inferences about the theoretical possibility of a reliable computational
model of the brain, we ought indeed to come to terms with the mysteries of
quantum theory.
   In the next two chapters, we shall be attempting to do just this-at least, in
so far as it is possible. Where I believe it is in principle not possible to come to
terms with quantum theory, I shall argue that we must try to bend the theory
itself, to see how it may better fit in with a believable picture of the world.

        Structure of the quantum world




         5 . 1 Quantum theory : puzzle and paradox
Quantum theory provides a superb description of physical reality on a small
scale, yet it contains many mysteries. Without doubt, it is hard to come to
terms with the workings of this theory, and it is particularly difficult to make
sense of the kind of 'physical reality'-or lack of it-that it seems to imply for
our world. Taken at its face value, the theory seems to lead to a philosophical
standpoint that many (including myself) find deeply unsatisfying. At best, and
taking its descriptions at their most literal, it provides us with a very strange
view of the world indeed. At worst, and taking literally the proclamations of
some of its most famous protagonists, it provides us with no view of the world
at all.
   In my own opinion, one should make a clear distinction between two quite
different kinds of mystery that the theory presents us with. There are those that
I shall call Z-mysteries, or puzzle mysteries, which are genuinely puzzling, but
directly experimentally supported, quantum truths concerning the world we
live in. Included, also, would be things of this general nature which, though
not actually experimentally verified as yet, leave little doubt, in view of what
has already been established, but that the expectations of the quantum theory
must be fulfilled. Some ofthe most striking of the Z-mysteries are those that go
under the name of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (or EPR) phenomena, which I
shall be discussing in some detail later ( §5.4, §6.5). The other kinds of quantum
mystery are things that I shall refer to as X-mysteries, or paradox mysteries,
which would, on the other hand, be things that the quantum formalism seems
to be telling us have to be true of the world, but have such an implausibly
paradoxical nature that we cannot really believe in them as being in any sense
'actually' true. They are mysteries which prevent us from taking the formalism
seriously, at the level concerned, as providing a believable picture of our
world. The best known X-mystery is the paradox of Schodinger's cat, where
the formalism of quantum theory seems to be telling us that large-scale objects,
such as cats, can exist in two totally different states simultaneously-such as
238                      Structure of the quantum world

the limbo of simultaneous combination of 'cat dead' and 'cat alive'. (I shall
discuss this kind of paradox in §6.6; cf. §6.9, Fig. 6.3, and ENM pp. 290--3 .)
   It is not infrequently contended that the difficulties that our present
generations have in coming to terms with the quantum theory are purely a
result of our being wedded to our physical concepts of the past. Accordingly,
each successive generation would become more attuned to these quantum
mysteries, so after sufficiently many generations they would become able to
accept them all without difficulty, whether they be Z-mysteries or X-mysteries.
My own view, however, differs fundamentally from this.
   I believe that the Z-mysteries are things that we might indeed get used to
and eventually accept as natural, but that this will not be the case for the
X-mysteries. In my opinion, the X-mysteries are philosophically unacceptable,
and arise merely because the quantum theory is an incomplete theory-or,
rather, because it is not completely accurate at the level of phenomena at
which the X-mysteries begin to appear. It is my view that, in an improved
quantum theory, the X-mysteries will simply be removed (i.e. crossed off) the
list of quantum mysteries. It is merely the Z-mysteries in whose presence we
must learn to snooze peacefully !
   Bearing this in mind, there may well be some question as to where to draw
the line between the Z-mysteries and the X-mysteries. Some physicists would
contend that there are no quantum mysteries that should be classified as
X-mysteries in this sense, and that all the strange and seemingly paradoxical
things that the quantum formalism tells us to believe must actually be true of
the world if we look at it in the right way. (Such people, if they are entirely
logical and if they take seriously the 'quantum-state' description of physical
reality, would have to be believers in some form of'many-worlds' viewpoint, as
will be described in §6.2 . In accordance with this viewpoint, Schrodinger's
dead cat and his live cat would inhabit different 'parallel' universes. If you
looked at the cat, then there would be copies of you, also, in each of the two
universes, one seeing a dead cat and the other a live cat.) Other physicists
would tend towards an opposite extreme, and would contend that I have been
too generous with the quantum formalism in agreeing with it that all the EPR­
type puzzles that will be concerning us later will actually be supported by
future experiment. I do not insist that everyone need take the same view as I
do, as to where to draw the line between the Z- and the X-mysteries. My own
choice is governed by the expectations that would be consistent with the
viewpoint that I shall be giving later, in §6. 1 2.
   It would be inappropriate for me to attempt to give a completely thorough
account of the nature of quantum theory in these pages. Instead, in this
chapter, I shall give a relatively brief and adequately complete description of
its necessary features, concentrating, to a large extent, on the nature of its
Z-mysteries. In the following chapter, I shall give my reasons for believing
that, because of its X-mysteries, present-day quantum theory must be an
incomplete theory, despite all the wonderful agreement that the theory has had
                           Structure of the quantum world                       239

with all experiments performed so far. Those readers who wish to pursue more
of the details of quantum theory may wish to read the account given in ENM,
Chapter 6, or else, for example, Dirac (1947) or Davies (1984).
   Later on, in this account-Chapter 6, §6.12-I shall present a recent idea
concerning the level at which schemes for the completion of quantum theory
ought to become relevant (and I had better warn the reader that this idea
differs significantly from that given in ENM, though the motivations are
closely similar). Then, in §7.10 (and §7.8), I shall give some suggestive reasons
for believing that such a scheme might well be non-computational in the
general kind of way needed. Standard quantum theory, on the other hand, is
non-computational only in the sense that it contains random elements as part
of the measurement procedure. As I have stressed in Part I (§3 . 1 8, §3. 1 9),
random elements alone do not provide the type of non-computability that we
shall ultimately need for an understanding of mentality.
   Let us start with some of the most striking of the Z-mysteries of quantum
theory. I shall illustrate these in terms of two quantum brain-teasers.


     5 .2 The Elitzur-Vaidman bomb-testing problem
Imagine a design of bomb that has a detonator on its nose so sensitive that the
slightest touch will set it off. Even a single photon of visible light would be sure
to do this were it not for the fact that in some cases the detonator is jammed­
so the bomb fails to explode, and must be classed as a dud. Let us suppose that
the detonator consists of a mirror attached to the bomb's nose, so that if a
(visible light) photon gets reflected off the mirror, its recoil would be sufficient
to move a plunger into the bomb and set if off-unless, of course, the bomb is a
dud, which would be the case when its sensitive plunger is jammed. We are to
suppose that, within the realm of classically operating devices, there is no way
to ascertain, once the bomb has been assembled, whether the detonator is
jammed without actually wiggling it in some way-something that would
certainly set the bomb off. (We shall take it that the only time when the
detonator might have got jammed would have been in the assembling of the
bomb in the first place.) See Fig. 5 . 1 .
   We must imagine that there i s a large supply of these bombs (money i s no
object!), but that the percentage of duds may be quite high. The problem is to
find one bomb for which it is certain that it is not a dud.
   This problem (and its solution) was proposed by Avshalom Elitzur and Lev
Vaidman (1993). I shall defer explaining the solution for the time being, as
some readers, already familiar with quantum theory and with what I have
referred to as its Z-mysteries, may wish to try their hands (or preferably minds)
at finding a solution. Suffice it to say, for the moment, that there is a solution
and that this solution, given an unlimited supply of bombs of this nature,
would be well within the bounds of present technology. For those who are not

already versed in the quantum theory-or who are, but have no wish to waste
their time searching for a solution-please bear with me for the moment (or go
directly to §5.9). I shall give the solution in due course, after the necessary
basic quantum ideas have been explained.
   At this stage, it need merely be pointed out that the fact that this problem
has a (quantum-mechanical) solution already indicates a profound difference
between quantum and classical physics. Classically, as the problem is phrased,
there is no way of deciding whether the bomb detonator has jammed other
than by actually wiggling it-in which case, if the detonator is not jammed, the
bomb goes off and is lost. Quantum theory allows for something different: a
physical effect that results from the possibility that the detonator might have
been wiggled, even if it was not actually wiggled ! What is particularly curious
about quantum theory is that there can be actual physical effects arising from
what philosophers refer to as counterfactuals-that is, things that might have
happened, although they did not in fact happen. In our next Z-mystery, we
shall see that the issue of counterfactuals looms large also in a different type of
situation.


                       5 . 3 Magic dodecahedra
For our second Z-mystery, let me describe a little story-and a puzzle. 1
Imagine that I have recently received a beautifully made regular dodeca­
hedron (Fig. 5.2). It was sent to me by a company of superb credentials,
known as 'Quintessential Trinkets', who inhabit a planet orbiting the distant
red giant star Betelgeuse. They have also sent another identical dodecahedron
to a colleague of mine who lives on a planet orbiting the star cx-Centauri, which

is about four light years away from us, and his dodecahedron arrived there at
roughly the same time as mine did here. Each dodecahedron has a button that
can be pressed, on each vertex. My colleague and I are to press individual
buttons one at a time, independently on our respective dodecahedra, at some
time and in some order that is completely up to our own individual choosing.
Nothing may happen when one of the buttons is pressed, in which case all we
do is to proceed to our next choice of button. On the other hand, a bell may
ring, when one of the buttons is pressed, accompanied by a magnificent
pyrotechnic display which destroys that particular dodecahedron.
   Enclosed with each dodecahedron is a list of guaranteed properties that
relate what can happen to my dodecahedron and to my colleague's. First, we
must be careful to orient our respective dodecahedra in a very precise
corresponding way. Detailed instructions are provided by Quintessential
Trinkets as to how our dodecahedra are to be aligned, in relation to, say, the
centres of the Andromeda galaxy and the galaxy M-87, etc. The important
thing is only that my dodecahedron and that of my colleague must be perfectly
aligned with one another. The list of guaranteed properties is, perhaps, fairly
long, but all we shall need from them is something quite simple.
   We must bear in mind that Quintessential Trinkets have been producing
things of this nature for a very long time-of the order of a hundred million
years, let us say-and they have never been found to be wrong in the properties
that they guarantee. The very excellent reputation that they have built up over
a million centuries depends upon this, so we can be quite sure that whatever

they claim will tum out actually to be true. What is more, there is a stupendous
CASH prize (still unclaimed) for anyone who does find them to be wrong!
  The guaranteed properties that we shall need concern the following type of
sequence of button-pressings. My colleague and I each independently select
one of the vertices of our respective dodecahedra. I shall call these the
SELECTED vertices. We do not press those particular buttons; but we do
press, in tum, and in some arbitrary order of our choosing, each of the three
buttons that inhabit vertices adjacent to the SELECTED one. If the bell rings
on one of them, then that stops the operation on that particular dodeca­
hedron, but the bell need not ring at all. We shall require just two properties.
These are (see Fig. 5.3):

      Fig. 5.4. On the assumption that our two dodecahedra are independent
      (unconnected) objects, we deduce that the buttons on mine are
      preassigned as bell-ringers (WHITE) or as silent (BLACK), where no two
      next-to-adjacent buttons can be WHITE and where no six adjacent to a
                     pair of antipodal ones can be all BLACK.




(a) if my colleague and I happen to have chosen diametrically opposite
    vertices as our respective SELECTED ones, then the bell can ring on one
    of the ones I press (adjacent to my SELECTED one) if and only if the bell
    rings on the diametrically opposite one of his-irrespective of the
    particular orders in which either of us may choose to press our respective
    buttons;
(b) if my colleague and I happen to have chosen exactly corresponding vertices
    (i.e. in the same directions out from the centre) as our respective
    SELECTED ones, then the bell must ring on at least one of six button­
    presses that we can make altogether.
  Now I want to try to deduce something about the rules that my own
dodecahedron must satisfy independently of what happens on IX-Centauri,
merely from the fact that Quintessential Trinkets are able to make such strong
guarantees without having any idea as to which buttons either I or my
colleague are likely to press. The key assumption will be that there is no long­
distance 'influence' relating my dodecahedron to my colleague's. Thus, I shall
suppose that our two dodecahedra behave as separate, completely indepen­
dent objects after they have left the manufacturers. My deductions (Fig. 5.4)
are:
(c) each of my own dodecahedron's vertices must be preassigned as either a
    bell-ringer (colour it WHITE) or as silent (colour it BLACK), where its
    bell-ringing character is independent of whether it is the first, second, or
    third of the buttons pressed adjacent to the SELECTED one;
244                      Structure of the quantum world

(d) no two next-to-adjacent vertices can be both bell-ringers (i.e. both
    WHITE);
(e) no set of six vertices adjacent to a pair of antipodal ones can be all silent
    (i.e. all BLACK).
(The term antipodal refers to vertices that are diametrically opposite on the
same dodecahedron.)
   We deduce (c) from the fact that my colleague might happen to choose, as his
SELECTED one, the diametrically opposite one to my own SELECTED one;
at least, Quintessential Trinkets will have no way of knowing that he will not
(counterfactuals!). Thus if one of my three button-presses happens to ring the
bell, then it must be the case that the diametrically opposite vertex, if pressed
by my colleague as the first of his three, must also ring his bell. This would be
the case whichever order I had chosen for pressing my three buttons, so (by the
absence of'influence' assumption) we can be sure that Quintessential Trinkets
must have prearranged that particular vertex to be a bell-ringer, irrespective of
my ordering, so as to ensure no conflict with (a).
   Likewise, (d) follows from (a) also. For suppose two next-to-adjacent
vertices on my dodecahedron are both bell-ringers. Whichever of these I
choose to press first must ring the bell-and suppose I have chosen their
common neighbour to be my SELECTED one. The order in which I press
them now does make a difference to which bell rings, which contradicts (a) if
my colleague happens to choose his SELECTED one opposite to mine (an
eventuality that Quintessential Trinkets must certainly be prepared for).
   Finally, (e) follows from (b), together with what we have now established.
For suppose that my colleague happens to choose, as his SELECTED one, the
vertex corresponding to my own SELECTED choice. If none of my three
buttons adjacent to this choice is a bell-ringer, then, by (b), one of my
colleague's three must be a bell-ringer. It follows from (a) that my own vertex
opposite to my colleague's bell-ringer must also be a bell-ringer. This
establishes (e).
   Now comes the puzzle. Try to colour each of the vertices of a dodecahedron
either WHITE or BLACK consistently according to the rules (d) and (e). You
will find that no matter how hard you try you cannot succeed. A better puzzle,
therefore, is to provide a proof that there is no such colouring. In order to give
any sufficiently motivated reader a chance to find an argument, I have
postponed my own proof to Appendix B (p. 300), where I give a fairly
straightforward demonstration, establishing that indeed no such colouring is
possible. Perhaps some reader will come up with a snappier proof.
   Can it be that, for the first time in a million centuries, Quintessential
Trinkets have made a mistake? Having established that it is impossible to
colour the vertices in accordance with (c), (d), and (e), and recalling the
stupendous CASH prize, we eagerly wait the four years, or so, that is required
for my colleague's message to arrive, describing what he did and when and
                          Structure of the quantum world                      245

whether his own bell rang; but when his message arrives, all hopes of CASH
vanish, for Quintessential Trinkets have turned out to be right again !
   What the argument of Appendix B (p. 300) shows is that there is simply no
way, in terms of any classical type of model, to construct magic dodecahedra
satisfying the conditions that Quintessential Trinkets were able to guarantee,
the two dodecahedra being assumed to act as separate independent objects
after they left the manufacturers. For it is not possible to guarantee the two
required properties (a) and (b) without some kind of mysterious 'connection'
holding between the two dodecahedra-a connection that persists right up
until we begin to press our buttons on the corners, and which would appear to
have to act instantaneously over a distance of about four light years. Yet
Quintessential Trinkets find themselves able to provide such a guarantee-for
something that seems to be impossible-and they have never been found to be
wrong!
   How do Quintessential Trinkets-or 'QT', as they are known for
short-actually do it? Of course 'QT' really stands for Quantum Theory! What
QT have actually done is to arrange for an atom, whose spin has the particular
value !, to be suspended at the centre of each of our dodecahedra. These two
atoms have been produced on Betelgeuse in an initial combined state of total
spin 0, and then carefully separated and isolated at the centres of our two
dodecahedra, so that their combined total spin value remains at 0. (We shall
see what all this means in §5. 10.) Now, when either my colleague or I press one
of the buttons at a vertex of our dodecahedron, a particular kind of (partial)
spin measurement is made, in the direction out from the centre of that
particular vertex. If the result of this measurement is found to be affirmative,
then the bell rings, and the pyrotechnic display follows shortly afterwards. I
shall be more specific about the nature of this measurement later (cf. §5. 18),
and I shall show in §5. 1 8 and Appendix B, why the rules (a) and (b) are a
consequence of the standard rules of quantum mechanics.
   The remarkable conclusion is that the assumption of no long-distance
'influence' is actually violated in quantum theory! A glance at the space-time
diagram of Fig. 5.5 will make it clear that the button-pressings that I and my
colleague make are spacelike separated (cf. §4.4), so that according to relativity
theory there can be no signals passing between us that transmit information
about which buttons we press or about which button, in either case, actually
rings the bell. Yet according to quantum theory, there is, nevertheless, some
kind of 'influence' that connects our dodecahedra across spacelike-separated
events. In fact, this 'influence' cannot be used to send directly usable
information instantaneously, and there is no operational conflict between
special relativity and quantum theory. Yet there is a conflict with the spirit of
special relativity-and we have here an illustration of one of the profound
Z-mysteries of quantum theory: the phenomenon of quantum non-locality. The
two atoms at the centres of our dodecahedra constitute what is called a single

entangled state, and they can not, according to the rules of standard quantum
theory, be considered as separate independent objects.


    5 .4 Experimental status of EPR-type Z-mysteries
The specific example that I have given here is one of a class of (thought)
experiments referred to as EPR measurements, after a famous paper written in
1935 by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen. (See §5.17 for a
more detailed discussion of EPR effects.) The original published version did
not refer to spin, but to certain combinations of position and momentum.
Subsequently, David Bohm presented a spin version, involving a pair of
particles of spin ! (say, electrons) that are emitted from a point in a combined
state of spin 0. The seeming conclusion of these thought experiments was that
a measurement performed, in one place in space, on one member of a quantum
pair of particles, could instantaneously 'influence' the other member in a very
specific way, though that other particle might be at an arbitrary distance from
the original one. Yet, such an 'influence' could not be used to send an actual
message from one to the other. In the terminology of quantum theory, the two
particles are said to be in a state of entanglement with one another. The
phenomenon of quantum entanglement-a genuine Z-mystery-was first
noticed as a feature of quantum theory by Erwin Schrodinger (1935b).
   Then, in a remarkable theorem published in 1966, John Bell showed that
there would be certain mathematical relationships (called Bell inequalities)
holding between the joint probabilities of various spin measurements that

might be made on any two such particles, that would be necessary
consequences of their being separate independent entities, as would be the case
in ordinary classical physics. Yet, in quantum theory these relationships could
be violated in a very specific way. This opened up the possibility of real
experiments that could be performed to test whether these relationships are
indeed violated by actual physical systems, as quantum theory says they ought
to be, whereas with a classical-type picture in which spatially separated objects
have to behave independently of one another, these relationships would
necessarily be satisfied. (See ENM, pp. 284, 301, for examples of this kind of
thing.)
   As an illustration of what such entanglements do not mean, John Bell liked
to give the example of Bert/mann's socks. Bertlmann was a colleague of his who
invariably wears socks of different colours. This is a known fact about
Bertlmann. (Having once met Bertlmann myself, I can also confirm that my
own observations were consistent with this fact.) Thus, if one happened to
catch sight of his left sock and noticed that it was green, then one would
instantly obtain the knowledge that his right sock was not green. Nevertheless,
it would be unreasonable to infer that there was a mysterious influence
travelling instantaneously from his left sock to his right sock. The two socks
are independent objects, and it does not require Quintessential Trinkets to
ensure that the differing-sock property will hold. The effect can be easily
arranged merely by Bertlmann determining ahead of time that his socks will
differ in colour. Bertlmann's socks do not violate Bell's relationships, and
there is no long-distance 'influence' connecting his socks. However, in the case
of QT's magic dodecahedra, no explanation of the 'Bertlmann socks' type can
explain their guaranteed properties. That, after all, was the whole point of the
discussion given in the previous section.
   Some years after Bell published his original paper, a number of actual
experiments were suggested, 2 and subsequently performed, 3 culminating in
the famous 1981 Paris experiment by Alain Aspect and his colleagues, which

      Fig. 5 .7. The Aspect experiment closely matches the expectations of

used pairs of 'entangled' photons (cf. §5.17) emitted in opposite directions to a
distance of some 12 metres separation. The expectations of quantum theory
were triumphantly vindicated, confirming the physical reality of Z-mysteries
of the EPR type, as predicted by standard quantum theory-and violating the
Bell relationships. See Fig. 5.6.
   It should be mentioned, however, that despite the very accurate agreement
that the results of the Aspect experiment have with the predictions of quantum
theory, there are still a few physicists who refuse to accept that the
phenomenon of quantum non-locality has been established. They may point
to the fact that the photon detectors in the Aspect experiment (and others like
it) are rather insensitive, and that most of the emitted pairs in a long run of
measurements would remain undetected. They thus have to argue that if the
photon detectors were made more sensitive, then at some stage of
improvement, the excellent agreement between the expectations of quantum
theory and observation would disappear, and the relationships that Bell
showed must hold for a local classical system would somehow be restored. To
my own way of thinking, it would be exceedingly unlikely that the excellent fit
between quantum theory and experiment that is exhibited in the Aspect
experiment (see Fig. 5.7) is somehow an artefact-an artefact of the
insensitivity of the detectors-and that with more perfect detectors the
agreement with theory would somehow go away, to the considerable extent
that would be needed in order that the Bell relationships could be recovered. 4
   The original Bell argument provided relationships (inequalities) between
the joint probabilities of the different possible outcomes. To estimate the actual
probabilities that are involved in a physical experiment, it is necessary to have
a long run of observations which must then be subjected to the appropriate

statistical analysis. More recently, a number of alternative schemes for
(hypothetical) experiments have been proposed which are of an entirely yes/no
character, with no probabilities arising at all. The first of these recent
suggestions was put forward by Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger (1989),
which involved spin measurements on spin � particles at three separate places
(say, the earth IX-Centuri, and Sirius, if Quintessential Trinkets were to have
made use of this scheme). Somewhat earlier, in 1967, Kochen and Specker had
put forward a closely related idea, but with spin 1 particles, although their
geometrical configurations were very complicated; and Bell himself did
something very similar but less explicitly, even earlier, in 1966. (These early
examples were not initially phrased in terms of EPR phenomena, but it was
made explicit how to do this by Heywood and Redhead in 1983, and also by
Stairs (1983).)5 The particular example, using dodecahedra, that I have given
has some advantages in the way that the geometry can be made explicit. 6 (There
are actually some proposed experiments to test things that are equivalent to
these various examples of Z-mysteries, though in a different physical form from
the one I have presented here: cf. Zeilinger et al. (1994).)


           5 . 5 Quantum theory's bedrock : a history
                               extraordinary
What are the basic principles of quantum mechanics? Before addressing them
explicitly, I should like to indulge in a historical digression. This will have
some advantages for us in emphasizing the status of the two most important
separate mathematical ingredients of the theory. It is a very remarkable fact,
and not at all a familiar one, that the two most fundamental of the ingredients
of modern quantum theory can both be traced back to the sixteenth century,
quite independently, and to one and the same man!
   This man, Gerolamo Cardano (Fig. 5.8), was born in squalor (ofunwedded
parents) in Milan, Italy, on 24 September 1501, rose to become the finest and
most famous physician of his time, and finally died in squalor in Rome on 20
September 1576. Cardano was an extraordinary man, though not at all well
known today. I hope that the reader will forgive me if I digress briefly to say
something about him, before returning to quantum mechanics proper.
   Indeed, he is not known at all in quantum mechanics-though his name, at
least, is well known to automobile mechanics ! For the universal joint linking an
ordinary motor-car's gearbox to its rear wheels, thus allowing the flexibility
that is needed in order to absorb the varying vertical movement of the sprung
rear axle, is called a cardan-shaft. Cardano had invented this device in about
1545, and in 1548 was able to incorporate it as part of the undercarriage of a
royal vehicle for the Emperor Charles V, thus ensuring a smooth ride over
very rough roads. He made numerous other inventions, such as a combination
lock similar to those used in modern safes. As a physician, he achieved great

fame, and kings and princes were among those he treated. He made many
advances in medicine and wrote a great number of books on medical and other
matters. He appears to have been the first to notice that the venereal diseases
now known as gonorrhoea and syphilis were actually two separate diseases,
requiring different treatments. He proposed a 'sanatorium' type of treatment
for sufferers of tuberculosis, some 300 years before it was essentially
rediscovered by George Boddington in about 1830. In 1 552, he cured John
Hamilton, the Archbishop of Scotland, of a severe debilitating asthmatic
condition-and thus affected the very course of British history.
   What have these achievements to do with quantum theory? None
whatsoever, except that they show something of the mental calibre of the man
who actually discovered, separately, what were to become the two most
important ingredients of that theory. For besides being outstanding as a
physician and inventor, he was also outstanding in another field­
mathematics.
   The first of these ingredients is probability theory. For quantum theory is, as
is well known, a probabilistic rather than a deterministic theory. Its very rules
                          Structure of the quantum world                     25 1

depend fundamentally on the laws of probability. In 1524, Cardano wrote his
Liber de Ludo Aleae (The Book of Games of Chance), which laid the
foundations of the mathematical theory of probability. Cardano had
formulated these laws some years earlier and had put them to good use. He
had been able to finance his studies at medical school in Pavia by applying
these laws in a practical way-through gambling! It must have been clear to
him at an early age that to make money through cheating at cards would be a
risky endeavour, for the man of whom his mother was a widow had come to an
unpleasant end because of just such an activity. Cardano found that he could
win honestly, by applying his discoveries concerning the very laws of
probability.
   What is the other fundamental ingredient of quantum theory that Cardano
had discovered? This second ingredient is the notion of a complex number. A
complex number is a number of the form
                                     a + ib,
where 'i' denotes the square root of minus one,
                                   i = J - 1,
and where a and b are ordinary real numbers (i.e. numbers that we now write
in terms of decimal expansions). We would now call a the real part and b the
imaginary part of the complex number a + ib Cardano had come across these
                                                .



strange kinds of number as part of his investigation of the solution of the
general cubic equation. These equations are things like
                           Ax 3 + Bx 2 + Cx + D = 0,
where A, B, C, and D are given real numbers, and where the equation has to be
solved for x. In 1545, he published a book, Ars Magna, in which appeared the
first complete analysis of the solution of these equations.
   There is an unfortunate story in connection with the publication of this
solution. In 1539 a mathematics teacher who was known under the name of
Nicolo 'Tartaglia' was already in possession of the general solution of a certain
broad class of cubic equations, and Cardano had sent a friend to find out from
him what the solution was. However, Tartaglia refused to reveal his solution,
so Cardano set to work and quickly rediscovered it for himself, publishing the
result in 1540, in his book The Practice of Arithmetic and Simple Mensuration.
In fact Cardano was able to extend what Tartaglia had done to cover all cases,
and later published his analysis of the general method of solution in Ars
Magna. In both books, Cardano acknowledged Tartaglia's prior claim to the
solution in that class of cases for which Tartaglia's procedure worked, but in
Ars Magna, Cardano made the mistake of maintaining that Tartaglia had
given him permission to publish. Tartaglia was furious, and claimed that he
had visited Cardano's home, on one occasion, revealing to him his solution on
252                       Structure of the quantum world

the strict condition that Cardano swore an oath of secrecy never to reveal it. In
any case, it would have been difficult for Cardano to publish his own work,
which extended what Tartaglia had previously done, without revealing the
earlier cases of solution, and it is hard to see that Cardano could have
proceeded in any other way without suppressing the whole thing. Neverthe­
less, Tartaglia bore Cardano a lifelong grudge, biding his time until, in 1 570,
after other appalling circumstances had led to the severe tarnishing of
Cardano's reputation, he contributed the final blow towards Cardano's
downfall. Tartaglia worked closely with the Inquisition, collecting a long
dossier of items that could be used against Cardano, and arranging for his
arrest and imprisonment. Cardano was released from prison only after a
special emissary sent by the Archbishop of Scotland (whom, we recill,
Cardano had cured of asthma) had travelled to Rome, in 1 57 1 , to plead for
him, explaining that Cardano was 'a scholar who troubles only with
preserving and curing the bodies in which God's souls may live to their
greatest length'.
   The 'appalling circumstances' referred to above concerned the trial for
murder of Cardano's eldest son Giovanni Battista. At this trial, Gerolamo had
put his reputation on the line in support of his son. This had done him no good
at all because Giovanni was actually guilty, having murdered his wife-whom
he had been forced to marry, in any case, in order to cover up a previous
murder that he had committed. Apparently the murder of Giovanni's wife was
aided and abetted by Cardano's even more scoundrelly younger son Aldo,
who then betrayed Giovanni and later delivered up his own father to the
Inquisition in Bologna. Aldo's reward was to become public torturer and
executioner for the Inquisition in Bologna. Even Cardano's daughter did his
own reputation no credit, for she died of syphilis as a result of her professional
activities as a prostitute.
    It would be an interesting exercise in historical psychology to understand
how Gerolamo Cardano, who appears to have been a caring father, devoted to
his children and to his wife, and who was a principled, honest, and sensitive
man, should have had such disastrous progeny. No doubt his attentions were
all too frequently distracted from family matters by his multifarious and time­
consuming other interests. No doubt his absence from home for over a year,
after his wife's death, when he had to travel to Scotland to treat the Archbishop
 (although Cardano's original commitment was merely for a meeting in Paris),
was not helpful to the development of his children. No doubt, also, his
conviction that the stars foretold his own death in 1546, in leading to a buildup
 of feverish writing and research, caused him to neglect his own wife so that she,
instead, succumbed towards the end of that very year.
    I can well imagine that it was Cardano's unfortunate fate and severely
 tarnished reputation-brought about by the combined efforts of his children,
 the Inquisition, and particularly Tartaglia-that resulted in his being so much
 less well known to us today than he deserves to be. There is no doubt in my
                          Structure of the quantum world                       253

own mind that he ranks as one of the very greatest of Renaissance figures.
Though he grew up in squalid circumstances, an atmosphere of learning
played an important part of his formative years. His father, Fazio Cardano,
was a geometer; and Gerolamo recalled an occasion when, at a young age, he
accompanied his father on a visit to Leonardo da Vinci, and the two men spent
long hours into the night, discussing matters of geometry.
   With regard to Cardano's publication of Tartaglia's earlier result, and of
incorrectly maintaining that he had permission to publish, one must surely
respect the importance of making one's discoveries public, rather than keeping
new knowledge suppressed. While it must be appreciated that Tartaglia's
livelihood had depended, to some extent, on the continued secrecy of his
discoveries (in view of the public mathematical competitions that he often
took part in), it was Cardano's publication of them that had the profound and
lasting effect on the development of mathematical science. Moreover, when it
comes to the matter of priority, it seems that this belongs to another scholar,
Scipione del Ferro, who was professor at the University of Bologna until his
death in 1526. At least del Ferro was in possession of the solution that
Tartaglia later rediscovered, although it remains uncertain to what extent he
was aware of how this solution could be modified to account for the cases later
considered by Cardano, nor is there any evidence that del Ferro was led to
contemplate complex numbers.
   Let us return in more detail to the cubic equation, in order to try to
understand why Cardano's contribution was so fundamental. It is not hard
(by use of a substitution of the form xr-+x + a ) to reduce the general cubic
equation to the form
                                   x 3 = px + q,
where p and q are real numbers. This much would have been essentially well
known at the time. However, we must bear in mind that even what we call
negative numbers were not normally accepted as actual 'numbers' in those
days, so different versions of the equation would have been written down
depending upon the various signs of p and q (e.g. x 3 + p'x = q, x 3 + q' = px), in
order to keep all the numbers non-negative that actually appear in the
equation. I shall adopt the modern notation in my descriptions here (which
allow negative numbers if required), to avoid excessive complication.
   The solutions of the cubic equation given above can be expressed
graphically if we plot the curves y = x 3 and y = px + q, and look for where the
two curves intersect. The values of x at the intersection points will give the
solutions of the equation. See Fig. 5.9; the curve y = x 3 is represented as
the thick curved line, and y = px + q is shown as a straight line for which
various possibilities are indicated. (I am not aware that either Cardano or
Tartaglia used such a graphical description, although they may have. It is
useful here just as an aid to visualizing the different situations which can
occur.) Now, in this notation, the cases that Tartaglia was able to solve occur
254                         Structure of the quantum world




      Fig. 5 .9. The solutions of the cubic equation x3 = px + q can be obtained
      graphically as the intersection(s) of the straight line y = px + q with the
      cubic curve y = x 3• Tartaglia's case is given when p � 0, represented by the
      downward sloping line P, while Cardano's new ones are given when p > 0,
      such as are provided by the lines Q or R. The casus i"educibilis occurs
      when there are three intersection points as with line R. In this case, a
          journey through the complex is needed to express the solutions.


when p is negative (or zero). In these cases the straight line slopes down to the
right, and a typical case is illustrated by the line P in Fig. 5.9. Note that in such
cases there is always exactly one intersection point of line with curve, so the
cubic equation has precisely one solution. In modem notation, we can express
Tartaglia's solution as
                             x =;}(w -!q) -;j(w + jq),
where
                                w = J[(!q)2 + (!p') 3]
with p' standing for - p, so that the quantities appearing in the expression
remain non-negative (taking q > O also).
  Cardano's extension of this procedure allowed for the cases where p > 0, and
we can write the solution (for positive p and negative q, but the sign of q is not
too important). Now, the straight line slopes up to the right (marked Q or R).
We see that for a given value of p (i.e. for a given slope), if q' ( = - q) is large
enough (so that the line intersects the y-axis far enough up) there will again be
exactly one solution, Cardano's expression for this (in modem notation) being
                            x =;}(jq' + w) +;j(jq' - w),
where

      Fig. 5. 10. Cardano's problem of finding two numbers whose product is 40
      and which sum to 10 can be expressed as finding the intersections of the
      curve xy = 40 with the line x + y = 10. In this case it is clear that the
                     problem cannot be solved with real numbers.




We can see, using modern notation and modern concepts of negative numbers
(and the fact that the cube root of a negative number is minus the cube root of
the positive form of that number), that Cardano's expression is basically the
same as Tartaglia's. However, there is something completely new looming
within the expression, in Cardano's case. For now, if q' is not too large, the
straight line can intersect the curve in three places, so there are three solutions
to the original equation (two being negative, if p > 0). This-the so-called
'casus irreducibilis'--occurs when (¥J') 2 < (tp } 3 , and we see that now w has to
be the square root of a negative number. Thus, the numbers !q' + w and !q' - w,
that appear under the cube root signs, are what we would now call complex
numbers; yet the two cube roots must sum to a real number in order to provide
the solutions to the equation.
   Cardano was well aware of this mysterious problem, and later on in Ars
Magna he explicitly addressed the question raised by the occurrence of
complex numbers in the solution of equations. He considered the problem of
finding two numbers whose product is 40 and which sum to 10, obtaining for
the (correct) answer, the two complex numbers
                         5 + j( - 15) and 5 - j( - 15) .
In graphical terms, we may consider this problem as that of finding the
intersection points of the curve xy = 40 with the straight line x + y = 10 in
Fig. 5. 10. We note that the curves, as depicted, do not actually intersect (in
real-number terms}, which corresponds to the fact that we need complex
256                       Structure of the quantum world

numbers in order to express the solution of the problem. Cardano was not
happy about such numbers, referring to the 'mental tortures involved' in
working with them. Nevertheless, the necessity of considering numbers of this
kind was forced upon him from his study of cubic equations.
   We should note that there is something a great deal more subtle about the
appearance of complex numbers in the solution of the cubic equation, as
depicted in Fig. 5.9, than there is in their appearance in the problem (basically
that of solving the quadratic equation x 2 - lOx + 40 = 0) depicted in Fig. 5.10.
In the latter case, it is clear that no solution exists at all unless complex
numbers are permitted, and one might take the position that such numbers are
a complete fiction, introduced merely to provide a 'solution' to an equation
that really has no solutions. However, this position will not explain what is
going on with the cubic equation. Here, in 'casus irreducibilis' (line R in
Fig. 5.9), there are actually three real solutions to the equation, whose
existence cannot be denied; yet to express any one of these solutions in terms of
surds (i.e. in terms of square roots and cube roots, in this case), we must take a
journey through the mysterious world of complex numbers, though our final
destination is back in the world of the reals.
   It seems that none before Cardano had perceived this mysterious world, and
how it might underlie the very world of 'reality'. (Others, such as Hero of
Alexandria and Diophantos of Alexandria, in the first and third centuries AD,
respectively, seem to have toyed with the idea that a negative number might
have a kind of 'square root', but neither took the bold step of combining such
'numbers' with the reals to provide complex numbers, nor did they perceive
any underlying link with real-number solutions of equations.) Perhaps
Cardano's curious combination of a mystical and a scientifically rational
personality allowed him to catch these first glimmerings of what developed to
be one of the most powerful of mathematical conceptions. In later years,
through the work ofBombelli, Coates, Euler, Wessel, Argand, Gauss, Cauchy,
Weierstrass, Riemann, Levi, Lewy, and many others, the theory of complex
numbers has flowered into one of the most elegant and universally applicable
of mathematical structures. But not until the advent of the quantum theory, in
the first quarter of this century, was a strange and all-pervasive role for
complex numbers revealed at the very foundational structure of the actual
physical world in which we live-nor had their profound link with
probabilities been perceived before this. Even Cardano could have had no
inkling of a mysterious underlying connection between his two greatest
contributions to mathematics-a link that forms the very basis of the material
 universe at its smallest scales.

            5 .6 The basic rules of quantum theory
What is this link? How do complex numbers and probability theory unite
together to yield an unquestionably superb description of the inner workings
                          Structure of the quantum world                        257

of our world? Roughly speaking it is at a very tiny underlying level of
phenomena that the laws of complex numbers hold sway, whereas it is in the
bridge between this tiny level and the familiar level of our ordinary perceptions
that probabilities play their part-but I shall need to be more explicit than this
if any real understanding is to be gained.
   Let us first examine the role of complex numbers. These arise in a strange
way that is itself very hard to accept as an actual description of physical reality.
It is particularly hard to accept because it seems to have no place in the
behaviour of things at the levels of phenomena that we can actually perceive,
and where the classical laws of Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein hold true.
Thus, in order to form a picture of the way in which quantum theory works, we
shall need, provisionally at least, to consider that there are two distinct levels
of physical action: the underlying quantum level, where these complex
numbers play their strange part, and the classical level of the familiar large­
scale physical laws. Only at the quantum level do complex numbers play this
role-a role that seems to disappear completely at the classical level. This is
not to say that there need really be a physical division between a level at which
the quantum laws operate and the level of classically perceived phenomena,
but it will be helpful if we imagine, for the moment, that there is such a division,
in order to make sense of the procedures that are actually adopted in quantum
theory. The deeper question as to whether or not there really is such a physical
division will be among our main concerns later.
   At what level is this quantum level? We must think of it as the level of
physical things that are in some sense 'small enough', like molecules, atoms, or
fundamental particles. But this 'smallness' need not refer to physical distance.
Quantum-level effects can occur across vast separations. Recall the 4 light
years that would separate the two dodecahedra in my story in §5.3, or the 12
metres that actually separated the pairs of photons in Aspect's experiment
(§5.4). It is not small physical size that defines the quantum level, but
something more subtle, and for the moment it will be best not to try to be
explicit. It will be helpful, however, to think of the quantum level as roughly
applying when we are concerned merely with very tiny differences in energy. I
shall return to this issue more thoroughly in §6. 12.
   The classical level, op. the other hand, is the level that we ordinarily
experience, where the real-number laws of classical physics hold good, such as
where ordinary descriptions-like that giving the location, the speed, and the
shape of a golf ball-make good sense. Whether or not there is any actual
physical distinction between the quantum level and the classical level is a
profound question that is intimately related to the issue of the X-mysteries, as
referred to in §5. 1 . Deferring this question for the moment, we regard it as
merely a matter of convenience that we separate the quantum from the
classical level.
   What fundamental role do complex numbers indeed play at the quantum
level? Think of an individual particle such as an electron. In a classical picture,
258                           Structure of the quantum world

the electron might have one location A or it might perhaps have another
location B. However, the quantum-mechanical description of such possibili­
ties that might be open to the electron are much broader. Not only might the
electron have one or another particular location, but it might alternatively
have any one of a number of possible states in which, in some clear sense, it
occupies both locations simultaneously! Let us use the notation l A> for the
state in which the electron has position A, and the notation I B> for the state in
which the electron is at B. * According to quantum theory, then, there are other
possible states open to the electron, written as
                                       w i A) + z i B),
where the weighting factors w and z that appear here are complex numbers (at
least one of which must be taken to be non-zero).
    What does this mean? If the weighting factors had been non-negative real
numbers, then we might have thought of this combination as representing, in
some sense, a probability-weighted expectation as to the location of the
electron, where w and z represent the relative probabilities of the electron
being at A or of it being at B, respectively. Then the ratio w:z would give the
ratio (probability of electron at A):(probability of electron at B). Accordingly,
if these were the only two possibilities open to the electron, we would have the
expectation wj(w + z) for the electron to be at A, and an expectation z/(w + z)
for it to be at B. If w = 0, then the electron would be certain to be at B; if z = 0, it
would be certain to be at A. If the state were just ' l A> + I B)', then this would
represent equal probabilities of the electron being at A or at B.
    But w and z are complex numbers, so !!UCh an interpretation makes no sense
at all. The ratios of the quantum weightings w and z are not ratios of
probabilities. They cannot be since probabilities always have to be real
numbers. It is not Cardano's probability theory that operates at the quantum
level, despite the common opinion that the quantum world is a probabilistic
world. Instead, it is his mysterious theory of complex numbers that underlies a
mathematically precise and probabilityjree description of the quantum level
of activity.
    We cannot say, in familiar everyday terms, what it 'means' for an electron to
be in a state of superposition of two places at once, with complex-number
weighting factors w and z. We must, for the moment, simply accept that this is
indeed the kind of description that we have to adopt for quantum-level

         *I am here using the standard Dirac 'ket' notation for quantum states, which will
      be somewhat convenient for us. Readers who are not familiar with quantum­
      mechanical notation need not be concerned about its significance here.
         Paul Dirac was one of the outstanding physicists of the twentieth century.
      Among his achievements was a general formulation of the laws of quantum theory,
      and also of its relativistic generalization involving the 'Dirac equation', which he
      discovered, for the electron. He had an unusual ability to 'smell out' the truth,
      judging his equations, to a large degree, by their aesthetic qualities!
                            Structure of the quantum world                          259

systems. Such superpositions constitute an important part of the actual
construction of our microworld, as has now been revealed to us by Nature. It is
just a fact that we appear to find that the quantum-level world actually
behaves in this unfamiliar and mysterious way. The descriptions are perfectly
clear cut-and they provide us with a micro-world that evolves according to a
description that is indeed mathematically precise and, moreover, completely
deterministic!


                                5 . 7 Unitary evolution U
What is this deterministic description? It is what is called unitary evolution,
and I shall use the letter U to denote it. This evolution is described by precise
mathematical equations, but it will not be important for us to know what these
equations actually are. Certain particular properties of U will be all that we
shall need. In what is referred to as the 'SchrOdinger picture', U is described by
what is called the Schrodinger equation, which provides the rate of change,
with respect to time, of the quantum state or wavefunction. This quantum state,
often denoted by the Greek letter 1/J (pronounced 'psi'), or by II/I), expresses the
entire weighted sum, with complex-number weighting factors, of all the
possible alternatives that are open to the system. Thus, in the particular
example that was referred to above, for which the alternatives open to an
electron were that it might be at one location A or another location B, the
quantum state II/I > would have to be some complex-number combination
                                        lt/J) = wiA) + zi B),
where w and z are complex numbers (not both zero). We call the combination
wiA> + ziB > a linear superposition of the two states l A > and I B). The quantity
II/I > (or l A > or I B > ) is often referred to as a state vector. More general quantum
states (or state vectors) might have a form such as
                            lt/J) = uiA) + vi B> + wiC > + . . . + ziF),
where u, v, . . . , z are complex numbers (not all zero) and lA), IB), . . . , IF >
might represent various possible locations for a particle (or perhaps some
other property of a particle, such as its state of spin; cf. §5. 10). Even more
generally, infinite sums would be allowed for a wavefunction or state vector
(since there are infinitely many possible positions available to a point particle),
but this kind of issue will not be important for us here.
     There is one technicality of the quantum formalism that I should mention
here. This is that it is only the ratios of the complex weighting factors that are
to have significance. I shall have more to say about this later. For the moment,
we merely take note of the fact that for any single state vector II/I), any complex
multiple ult/J > of it (with u :;i: O) represents the same physical state as does lt/J).
Thus, for example, uwiA + uzi B > represents the same physical state as
260                             Structure of the quantum world

w i A> + z i B). Accordingly, only the ratio w:z has physical significance, not w
and z separately.
    Now the most basic feature of the SchrOdinger equation (i.e. ofU) is that it is
linear. This is to say, if we have two states, say II/I > and j<J>), and if the
SchrOdinger equation would tell us that, after a time t, the states II/I) and 1 4>)
would each individually evolve to new states 11/J') and 1 4>'), respectively, then
any linear superposition w i i/J> + z l </>), must evolve, after the same time t, to the
corresponding superposition w lt/J' ) + z l </>'). Let us use the symbol IV'+ to denote
the evolution after time t. Then linearity asserts that if


 then the evolution


would also hold. This would (consequently) apply also to linear superposi­
tions of more than two individual quantum states; for example,
u l x > + w l t/J> + z l 4>> would evolve, after time t, to u l x'> + w i i/J') + z l 4>') , if l x> .
II/I), and 1 4>) would each individually evolve t o l x'), II/I'), and 1 4>'), respectively.
Thus, the evolution always proceeds as though each different component of a
superposition were oblivious to the presence of the others. As some would say,
each different 'world' described by these component states evolves indepen­
dently, according to the same deterministic Schrodinger equation as the
others, and the particular linear superposition that describes the entire state
preserves the complex-number weightings unchanged, as the evolution
proceeds.
     It might be thought, in view of this, that the superpositions and the complex
weightings play no effective physical role, since the time evolution of the
separate states proceeds as though the other states were not there. However,
this would be very misleading. Let me illustrate what can actually happen with
an example.
     Consider a situation in which light impinges on a half-silvered mirror­
which is semi-transparent mirror that reflects just half the light falling upon it
and transmits the remaining half. Now in quantum theory, light is perceived to
be composed of particles called photons. We might well have imagined that for
a stream of photons impinging on our half-silvered mirror, half the photons
would be reflected and half would be transmitted. Not so ! Quantum theory
tells us that, instead, each individual photon, as it impinges on the mirror, is
separately put into a superposed state of reflection and transmission. If the
photon before its encounter with the mirror is in state l A), then afterwards its
evolves according to U to become a state that can be written I B> + i i C), where
I B> represents the state in which the photon is transmitted through the mirror
and I C> the state where the photon is reflected from it; see Fig. 5.1 1 . Let us
write this

The factor 'i' arises here because of a net phase shift by a quarter of a
wavelength 7 that occurs between the reflected and transmitted beams at such a
mirror. (To be more complete, I should also have included a time-dependent
oscillatory factor and an overall normalization here, but this plays no role in
the present discussion. In these descriptions I am giving only what is essential
for our immediate purposes. I shall say a little more about the oscillatory
factor in §5. 1 1 and the question of normalization in §5. 12. For a more
complete description, see any standard work on quantum theory 8 ; also ENM,
pp. 243-50.)
   Though, from the classical picture of a particle, we would have to imagine
that I B> and I C> just represent alternative things that the photon might do, in
quantum mechanics we have to try to believe that the photon is now actually
doing both things at once in this strange, complex superposition. To see that it
cannot just be a matter of classical probability-weighted alternatives, let us
take this example a little further and try to bring the two parts of the photon
state-the two photon beams-back together again. We can do this by first
reflecting each beam with a fully silvered mirror. After reflection, 9 the photon
state I B> would evolve according to U, into another state i i D), whilst I C>
would evolve into i i E> :
                             I B> ,.....i i D> and I C> ,.....i i E).
Thus the entire state I B> + i i C> evolves, by U, into
                              I B> + i i C> ,.....i i D> + i(i i E>)
                                            = i i D> - I E>
(since i 2 = - 1 ). Suppose, now, that these two beams come together at a fourth
mirror, which is now half silvered, as depicted in Fig. 5.12 (where I am
assuming that all the beam lengths are equal, so that the oscillatory factor that
I am ignoring continues to play no part). The state I D> evolves into a
combination I G> + i i F), where I G> represents the transmitted state and I F>

      Fig. 5.12. The two parts of the photon state are brought together by two
      fully silvered mirrors, so as to encounter each other at a final half-silvered
      mirror. They interfere in such a way that the entire state emerges in state
      I F>. and the detector at G cannot receive the photon. (Mach-Zehnder

the reflected one; similary, I E) evolves into I F> + i i G), since it is now the state
I F> that is the transmitted state and I G> the reflected one:
                       I D ) �'�'+ I G) + i i F> and I E ) �'�'+ I F) + i i G).
Our entire state i i D) - I E) is now seen (because ofthe linearity ofU) to evolve:
                      i i D) - I E) �'�'+i( I G) + i i F>) - ( I F) + i i G))
                                        = i i G> - I F> - I F> - i i G>
                                        = - 2 I F).
(The multiplying factor - 2 appearing here plays no physical role because, as
mentioned above, if the entire physical state of a system-here I F)-is
multiplied by a non-zero complex number, then this leaves the physical
situation unaltered.) Thus we see that the possibility I G> is not open to the
photon; the two beams together combine to produce just the single possibility
I F>. This curious outcome arises because both beams are present simultan­
eously in the physical state of the photon, between its encounters with the first
and last miHors. We say that the two beams interfere with one another. Thus
the two alternative 'worlds' of the photon between these encounters are not
really separate, but they can affect one another via such interference
phenomena.
   It is important to bear in mind that this is a property of single photons. Each
individual photon must be considered to feel out both routes that are open to
                          Structure of the quantum world                       263

it, but it remains one photon; it does not split into two photons in the
intermediate stage, but its location undergoes the strange kind of complex­
number-weighted co-existence of alternatives that is characteristic of quantum
theory.



                   5 . 8 State-vector reduction R
In the example considered above, the photon finally emerges in an
unsuperposed state. Let us imagine that detectors (photocells) are placed at
the points marked F and G in Fig. 5.12. Since, in this example, the photon
emerges in a state (proportional to) I F), with no contribution from IG), it
follows that the detector at F registers receipt of the photon, and the detector
at G registers nothing.
   What would happen in a more general situation such as when a superposed
state like wi F> + z iG) encounters these detectors? Our detectors are making a
measurement to see whether the photon is in state I F> or in state IG). A
quantum measurement has the effect of magnifying quantum events from the
quantum to the classical level. At the quantum level, linear superpositions
persist under the continuing action ofU-evolution. However, as soon as effects
are magnified to the classical level, where they can be perceived as actual
occurrences, then we do not ever find things to be in these strange complex­
weighted combinations. What we do find, in this example, is that either the
detector at F registers or the detector at G registers, where these alternatives
occur with certain probabilities. The quantum state seems mysteriously to
have 'j umped' from one involving the superposition wi F> + zi G) to one in
which just I F> or just IG > is involved. This 'j umping' of the description of the
state of the system, from the superposed quantum-level state to a description
in which one or other of the classical-level alternatives take place, is called
state-vector reduction, or collapse of the wavefunction, and I shall use the letter
R to denote this operation. Whether R is to be considered as a real physical
process or some kind of illusion or approximation is a matter that will be of
great concern for us later. The fact that, in our mathematical descriptions at
least, we have to dispense with U from time to time, and bring in this totally
different procedure R, is the basic X-mystery of quantum theory. For the
moment, it will be better that we do not probe the matter too closely and
(provisionally) regard R as being, effectively, some process that just happens
(at least in the mathematical descriptions that are used) as a feature of the
procedure of magnifying an event from the quantum to the classical level.
   How do we actually calculate these different probabilities for the alternative
outcomes of a measurement on a superposed state? There is, indeed, a
remarkable rule for determining these probabilities. This rule states that for a
measurement which decides between alternative states I F> and IG), say, by
264                       Structure of the quantum world

using detectors at F and G, respectively, in the situation above, then upon the
detectors encountering the superposed state
                                  wjF) + zjG),
the ratio of the probability that the detector at F registers to the probability
that the one at G registers is given by the ratio


where these are the squared moduli of the complex numbers w and z . The
squared modulus of a complex number is the sum of the squares of its real and
imaginary parts; thus, for
                                    z = x + iy,
where x and y are real numbers, the squared modulus is
                              lzl 2 = x 2 + y 2
                                    = (x + iy) (x - iy)
                                    = zz
where z( = x - iy) is called the complex conjugate ofz , and similarly for w. (I am
tacitly assuming, in the above discussion, that the states that I have been
denoting by jF), jG), etc., are appropriately normalized states. This will be
explained later, cf. §5.12; the normalization is needed, strictly speaking, for
this form of the probability rule to hold.)
  It is here, and only here, that Cardano's probabilities enter the quantum
scene. We see that the quantum-level complex-number weightings do not
themselves play roles as relative probabilities (which they cannot do, because
they are complex) but the real-number squared moduli of these complex
numbers do play such roles. Moreover, it is only now, when measurements are
made, that indeterminancy and probabilities come in. A measurement of a
quantum state occurs, in effect, when there is a large magnification of some
physical process, raising it from the quantum to the classical level. In the case
of a photocell, the registering of a single quantum event-in the form of the
reception of a photon--eventually causes a classical-level disturbance, say an
audible 'click'. Alternatively, we might use a sensitive photographic plate to
register the arrival of a photon. Here, the quantum event of this photon arrival
would be magnified to the classical level in the form of a visible mark on the
plate. In each case, the measuring apparatus would consist of a · delicately
poised system that can use a tiny quantum event to trigger off a much larger
classical-scale observable effect. It is in this passage from the quantum level to
the classical level that Cardano's complex numbers get their moduli squared to
become Cardano's probabilities!
   Let us see how to apply this rule in a particular situation. Suppose, instead

      Fig. 5 . 1 3 . If an obstruction is placed in the beam !D), then it becomes
      possible for the detector at G to register the arrival of the photon (when
                        the obstruction does not absorb the photon !).




of having the mirror at the lower right, we were to place a photocell there; then
this photocell would encounter the state

                                     IB) + iiC>,

where the state IB> would cause the photocell to register whilst IC> would
leave it undisturbed. Thus the ratio of the respective probabilities is
I W =IW = l : l ; that is to say, the probability of each of the two possible
outcomes is the same, so that the photon is equally likely to activate the
photocell as not to.
   Let us consider a slightly more complicated arrangement. Suppose, instead
of having the photocell in place of the lower right-hand mirror, we block off
one of the beams in the above example with an obstruction capable of
absorbing the photon, say in the beam corresponding to the photon state ID>
(Fig. 5.13); then the interference effect that we had earlier would be destroyed.
It would then be possible for the photon to emerge in a state involving the
possibility IG) (in addition to the possibility IF>) provided that the photon is
not actually absorbed by the obstruction. If it is absorbed by the obstruction,
then the photon would not emerge at all in any combination of the states IF>
or I G); but ifit is not, then the photon's state, as it approaches the final mirror,
would simply be - IE), which evolves to - IF> - iiG ), so that both
alternatives IF), IG> are indeed involved in the final outcome.
   In the particular example considered here, when the obstruction is present
but does not absorb the photon, the respective complex-number weightings
for the two possibilities IF> and IG> are - 1 and - i (the emergent state being
 - IF> - iiF)). Thus the ratio of the respective probabilities is 1 - W :I - ij 2 ,
266                        Structure of the quantum world

again giving equal probabilities for each of the two possible outcomes, so that
the photon is equally likely to activate the detector at F as at G.
   Now the obstruction itself must also be considered as a 'measuring
apparatus', in accordance with the fact that we are considering that the
alternatives 'obstruction absorbs the photon' and 'obstruction does not
absorb the photon' are classical alternatives that should not themselves be
assigned complex-number weightings. Even though the obstruction might not
be delicately organized in such a way that the quantum event ofits absorbing a
photon is magnified to a classically observable event, we must consider that it
'could have been' so organized. The essential point is that upon absorbing the
photon, a considerable amount of the obstruction's actual substance becomes
slightly disturbed by the photon, and it becomes impossible to collect together
all the information contained in this disturbance so as to retrieve the
interference effects that characterize quantum phenomena. Thus the obstruc­
tion must-in practice at least-be considered as a classical-level object, and it
serves the purpose of a measuring apparatus whether or not it registers the
absorption of the photon in a practically observable way. (I shall be returning
to this issue later, in §6.6).
   With this in mind, we are also at liberty to use the 'squared modulus rule' to
calculate the probability that the obstruction will actually absorb the photon.
The photon state that the obstruction encounters is i i D> I E>, and it absorbs
                                                             -



the photon if it finds the photon in state I D ) , as opposed to the other
alternative I E ) . The ratio of the probability of absorption to that of non­
absorption is I W : I - W = l :l ; so again the two alternatives are equally
probable.
   We could also imagine a somewhat similar situation where, instead of
having an obstruction at D, we could attach some measuring device to the
lower right-hand mirror, rather than having this mirror replaced by a detector,
as was considered earlier. Let us imagine that this device is so sensitive that it is
able to detect (i.e. to magnify to the classical level) whatever impulse is
imparted to the mirror by the photon being merely reflected off it, this
detection being finally signalled, say, by the movement of a pointer (see
Fig. 5.14). Thus, the photon state IB), upon encountering the mirror, would
activate this pointer movement, but the photon state IC > would not. When
presented with the photon state IB) + iiC), the device would 'collapse the
 wavefunction' and read the state as though it were ehher IB> (pointer moves)
 or IC > (pointer stays put), with equal probabilities (given by I W :jW). The
 process R would thereby take place at this stage. For the ensuing behaviour of
 the photon, we can follow the rest of the argument through essentially as
 above, and we find that, as was the case with the obstruction, it is again equally
 probable for either the detector at G or the detector at F finally to detect the
 photon (whether or not the pointer moves). For this set-up, the lower right­
 hand mirror would need to be slightly 'wobbly' in order that the pointer
 movement can be activated, and this lack of mirror rigidity would upset the

      mirror slightly 'wobbly' and using this wobble to register, by means of
      some detector, whether or not the photon has actually been reflected off
      that mirror. Again interference is destroyed, and the detector at G is
                              enabled to detect the photon.




delicate organization needed to ensure the 'destructive interference' between
the two photon routes between A and G which had originally prevented the
detector at G from registering.
   The reader may well perceive that there is something not altogether
satisfactory about the matter of when-and indeed why-the quantum rules
should be changed from quantum-level complex-number-weighted determi­
nism to classical-level probability-weighted non-deterministic alternatives,
characterized mathematically by the taking of the squared moduli of the
complex numbers involved. What is it that really characterizes some pieces of
physical material, such as the photon detectors at F and G, or at the lower
right-hand mirror-and also the possible obstruction at D-as being
classical-level objects, whereas the photon, at the quantum level, must be
treated so differently? Is it merely the fact that the photon is a physically simple
system that allows its complete treatment as a quantum-level object, whereas
detectors and obstructions are complicated things which need an approximate
treatment in which the subtleties of quantum-level behaviour are somehow
averaged away? Many physicists would certainly argue this way, claiming
that, strictly speaking, we should treat all physical things quantum­
mechanically, and it is a matter of convenience that we treat large or
complicated systems classically, the probability rules involved in the 'R'
procedure being, somehow, features of the approximations involved. We shall
be seeing in §6.6 and §6.7 that this viewpoint does not really get us out of our
difficulties-the difficulties presented by the X-mysteries of quantum theory­
nor does it explain the miraculous R-rule whereby probabilities arise as
squared moduli of complex-number weightings. For the moment, however,
268                        Structure of the quantum world

we must suppress our worries, and continue to investigate the implications of
the theory, especially in relation to its Z-mysteries.



   5 .9 Solution of the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb-testing
                         problem
We are now in a position to provide a solution to the bomb-testing problem of
§5.2. What we must do is to see if we can use the bomb's delicate mirror as a
measuring device, rather in the way that the obstruction or the wobbly mirror
with detector acted, in the above discussion. Let us set up a system of mirrors,
two of which are half silvered, exactly in the way that we did above, but where
the bomb's mirror now plays the role of the mirror at the lower right of
Fig. 5. 14.
   The point is that ifthe bomb is a dud, in the only sense that we are allowing
for the purposes of this puzzle, then its mirror is jammed in a fixed position, so
that the situation is now just as depicted in Fig. 5.12. The photon emitter sends
a single photon at the first mirror initially in the state JA). Since the situation is
just the same as that of §5.7, the photon must ultimately emerge in the state
(proportional to) JF), as before. Thus the detector af F registers the arrival of
the photon, but the one at G cannot do so.
   If, however, the bomb is not a dud, then the mirror is capable of responding
to the photon and the bomb would explode if it finds that the photon impinges
upon its mirror. The bomb is indeed a measuring device. The two quantum­
level alternatives 'photon impinging on mirror' and 'photon not impinging on
mirror' are magnified by the bomb to the classical-level alternatives 'bomb
explodes' and 'bomb fails to explode'. It responds to the state JB) + iJC) by
exploding if it finds the photon in state JB) and by failing to explode if it finds
that it is not in state JB)-whence it is in state JC). The relative probabilities of
these two occurrences is I W=IW = 1 : 1 . If the bomb explodes, then it has
detected the presence of the photon, and what happens subsequently is of no
concern. If, however, the bomb fails to explode, then the photon's state is
reduced (by the action of R) to the state iJC) impinging on the upper left
mirror, and emerging from that mirror in state - JE). After encountering the
final (half-silvered) mirror, the state becomes - JF) - iJG), so there is a
relative probability 1 - W:I - W = 1 : 1 for the two possible outcomes 'detector
at F registers photon's arrival' and 'photc,m at G registers photon's arrival' just
as in the cases considered in the previous section, when the obstruction fails to
absorb the photon or when the pointer fails to move. Thus there is now the
definite possibility for the detector at G to receive the photon.
   Suppose, then, that in one of these bomb tests it is found that the detector at
G actually does register the arrival ofthe photon in some cases when the bomb
does not explode. From what has been said above, we see that this can happen
                                Structure of the quantum world                                     269

only if the bomb is not a dud! When it is a dud, it is only the detector at F that
can register. Thus, in all those circumstances in which G in fact registers we
have a bomb that is guaranteed to be active, i.e. not a dud! This solves the
bomb-testing problem, as proposed in §5.2.*
  It will be seen, from the above considerations of the probabilities involved,
that in a long run of tests, half of the active bombs will explode and will be lost.
Moreover, only in half of the cases where an active bomb does not explode will
the detector at G register. Thus, if we run through the bombs one after the
other, we shall find only a quarter of the originally active bombs as now
guaranteed to be actually still active. We can then run through the remaining
ones again, and again retrieve those for which the detector at G registers; and
then repeat the whole process again and again. Ultimately, we obtain just one­
third (since -!: + /6 + i4 + . . . = �) of the active bombs that we started with, but
now all are guaranteed. (I am not sure what the bombs will now be used for,
but perhaps it would be prudent not to ask!)
  This may seem to the reader to be a wasteful procedure, but it is a
remarkable fact that it can be carried out at all. Classically there would be no
way of doing such a thing. It is only in quantum theory that counterfactual
possibilities can actually influence a physical outcome. Our quantum
procedure allows us to achieve something that would seem impossible-and is
indeed impossible within classical physics. It should be remarked, moreover,
that with certain refinements this wastefulness can be reduced from two­
thirds to effectively one-half (Elitzur and Vaidman 1993). More strikingly,
P. G. Kwiat, H. Weinfurter, A. Zeilinger, and M. Kasevich have recently
shown, using a different procedure, how to reduce the wastefulness effectively
to zero !
  With regard to the difficult matter of having an experimental device that

         * The Shabbos switch. The fact that both Elitzur and Vaidman are at universities
      in Israel has suggested, in conversations with Artur Ekert, a device for assisting
      those who adhere strictly to the Jewish faith, and who therefore are prevented from
      switching electrical appliances on or off during their Sabbath. Instead of patenting
      our device, and thereby making our fortunes, we have generously decided to make
      our important idea public so that it may be available for the good of the Jewish
      community at large. All one needs is a photon source which emits a continual
      succession of photons, two half-silvered mirrors, two fully silvered mirrors, and a
      photocell attached to the appliance in question. The set-up is just as in Fig. 5 . 1 3 ,
      with the photocell placed a t G. T o activate o r deactivate the appliance, one places a
      finger in the beam at D, as with the obstruction of Fig. 5. 1 3 . If the photon hits one's
      finger, nothing happens to the appliance-surely no sin. (For photons are
      continually impinging on one's fingers, in any case, even on the Sabbath.) But if the
      finger encounters no photon at all, then there is a 50% chance (up to the Will of
      God) that the switch on the appliance will be activated. Surely, also, it can be no sin
      to fail to receive the photon that activates the switch ! (A practical objection might
      be raised that sources which emit individual photons are difficult-and expensive­
      to manufacture. But this is not really necessary . Any photon source will do, since
      the argument can be applied to each one of its photons individually.)

actually produces individual photons one at a time, it should be mentioned
that such devices can now be constructed (see Grangier et al. 1986).
   As a final comment, I should remark that it is not necessary for a measuring
device to be so dramatic an object as the bomb in this discussion. Indeed, such
a 'device' need not actually signal its reception or non-reception of the photon
to the outside world at all. A slightly wobbly mirror would, by itself, do as a
measuring device, if it were light enough that it would move significantly as a
result of the photon's impact and consequently disperse this motion as friction.
The mere fact that the mirror is wobbly (say, the lower right-hand one, as
before) will allow the detector at G to receive the photon, even if the mirror
does not actually wobble, thus indicating that the photon went the other way.
It is the mere potentiality for it to wobble that allows the photon to reach G!
Even the obstruction, referred to in the previous section, plays an extremely
similar role. It serves, in effect, to 'measure' the presence of the photon
somewhere along its track as described by the successive states IB > and ID). A
failure of it to receive the photon, when it is capable of receiving it, counts just
as much as a 'measurement' as actually receiving it would.
   Measurements of this negative and non-invasive kind are called null (or
interaction-free) measurements, see Dicke (198 1 ), and they have a consider­
able theoretical (and perhaps, eventually, even practical) importance. There
are experiments to test directly the predictions of quantum theory in such
situations. In particular, Kwiat, Weinfurter, and Zeilinger have recently
performed an experiment of the precise type that is involved in the
Elitzur-Vaidman bomb-testing problem! As we have now become used to
accepting, the expectations of quantum theory have been completely
confirmed. Null measurements are indeed among the profound Z-mysteries of
quantum theory.

   5 . 1 0 Quantum theory of spin ; the Riemann sphere
In order to address the second of my two introductory quantum puzzles, it will
be necessary to look into the structure of quantum theory in a little more
detail. Recall that my dodecahedron, and also that of my colleague, had an
atom of spin ! at its centre. What is spin, and what is its particular importance
for quantum theory?
   Spin is an intrinsic property of particles. It is basically the same physical
concept as the spinning-or angular momentum-of a classical object, such as
a golf ball, or cricket ball, or the whole earth. However, there is the (minor)
difference that for such large objects, by far the major contribution to its
angular momentum comes from the orbiting motions of all its particles about
one another, whereas for a single particle, spin is a property that is intrinsic to
the particle itself. In fact, the spin of a fundamental particle has the curious
feature that its magnitude always has the same value, although the direction of
its spin axis can vary-though this 'axis', also, behaves in a very odd way that

bears little relation, in general, to what can happen classically. The magnitude
of the spin is described in terms of the basic quantum-mechanical unit h, which
is Dirac's symbol for Planck's constant h, divided by 2n:. The measure of spin of
a particle is always a (non-negative) integer or half-integer multiple of h,
namely 0, th, h, !h, 2h, etc. We refer to such particles as having spin 0, spin !-,
spin 1, spin i. spin 2, etc., respectively.
     Let us start by considering the simplest case (apart from spin 0, which is too
simple, there being just one, spherically symmetrical, state of spin in this case),
namely the case of spin t. such as that of an electron or a nucleon (a proton or
neutron). For spin !-, all states of spin are linear superpositions of just two
states, say the state of right-handed spin about the upward vertical, written l i > ,
o r right-handed spin about the downward vertical, written I ! > (see Fig. 5.15).
The general state of spin would now be some complex-number combination
I t/!> = w l i> + z l !>· In fact it turns out that each such combination represents
the state of the particle's spin (of magnitude th) being about some specific
direction determined by the ratio of the two complex numbers w and z. There
is nothing special about the particular choice of the two states l i > and I ! > - All
the various combinations of these two states are just as clear-cut as states of
spin as are the two original ones.
     Let us see how this relationship can be made more explicit and geometrical.
This will help us to appreciate that the complex-number weighting factors w
and z are not quite such abstract things as they may have seemed to be, so far.
In fact they have a clear relationship with the geometry of space. (I imagine
that such geometric realizations might have pleased Cardano, and perhaps
helped him with his 'mental tortures'-though quantum theory itself provides
us with new mental tortures! )
     I t will be helpful, first, t o consider the now-standard representation of
complex numbers as points on a plane. (This plane is variously called the
Argand plane, the Gauss plane, the Wessel plane, or just the complex plane.)
The idea is simply to represent the complex number z = x + iy, where x and y
are real numbers, by the point in the plane whose ordinary Cartesian
coordinates are (x, y), with respect to some chosen Cartesian axes (see

the vertices of a square. There are simple geometrical rules for the sum and the
product of two complex numbers (Fig. 5.17). Taking the negative - z of a
complex number z is represented by reflection in the origin; taking the
complex conjugate i, of z, by reflection in the x-axis.
  The modulus of a complex number is the distance from the origin of the
point representing it; the squared modulus is thus the square of this number.
The unit circle is the locus of points that are of unit distance from the origin

sometimes called pure phases, having the form

where (J is real and measures the angle that the line joining the origin to the
point representing this complex number makes with the x-axis. *
  Now let us see how to represent ratios of pairs of complex numbers. In the
above discussion, I indicated that a state is not physically changed if it is
muliplied, overall, by a non-zero complex number (recall, for example, that
- 2IF > was to be considered as being physically the same state as IF>). Thus,
generally, It/! > is physically the same as u l t/J ) , for any non-zero complex
number u. Applied to the state
                                      l t/l ) = wl f > + zl !>.
We see that if we multiply both of w and z by the same non-zero complex
number u, we do not change the physical situation that is represented by the
state. It is the different ratios z:w of the two complex numbers w and z that
provide the different physically distinct spin states (uz:uw being the same as z:w
if u =F O).
   How do we geometrically represent a complex ratio? The essential
difference between a complex ratio and just a plain complex number is that
infinity (denoted by the symbol 'oo') is also allowed as a ratio, in addition to all
the finite complex numbers. Thus, if we think of the ratio z:w to be represented,
in general, by the single complex number zjw, we have trouble when w = O. To
cover this possibility, we simply use the symbol oo for z/w in the case when
w = O. This occurs when we consider the particular state 'spin down':

lift > = zl ! > = Oit > + zl ! > . Recall that we are not allowed to have both w = O and
z = O, but w = O by itself is perfectly allowable. (We could use wjz instead, to
represent this ratio of we prefer; then we need oo to cover the case z = 0, which
gives the particular state 'spin up'. It does not matter which description we
use.)
   The way to represent the space of all possible complex ratios is to use a
sphere, referred to as the Riemann sphere. The points of the Riemann sphere
represent complex numbers or oo . We can picture the Riemann sphere as a
sphere of unit radius whose equatorial plane is the complex plane and whose
centre is the origin (zero) of that plane. The actual equator of this sphere will be
identified with the unit circle in the complex plane (see Fig. 5.19). Now, to
represent a particular complex ratio, say z :w, we mark the point P on the
complex plane that represents the complex number p = zjw (supposing, for the
moment, that w � O), and then we project P, on the plane, to a point P' on
the sphere from the south pole S. That is to say, we take the straight line from S
to P and mark the point P' on the sphere as the point where this line meets it
 (apart from at S itself). This mapping between points on the sphere and points
on the plane is called stereographic projection. To see that it is reasonable for
the south pole S itself to represent oo , we imagine a point P in the plane that
moves off to a very large distance; then we find that the point P' that
corresponds to it approaches the south pole S very closely, reaching S in the
limit as P goes to infinity,
   The Riemann sphere plays a fundamental role in the quantum picture of
two-state systems. This role is not always evident explicitly, but the Riemann
sphere is always there, behind the scenes. It describes, in an abstract
geometrical way, the space of physically distinguishable states that can be built
                           Structure of the quantum world                        275

up, by quantum linear superposition, from any two distinct quantum states.
For example, the two states might be two possible locations for a photon, say
I B > and IC > . The general linear combination would have the form
wiB > + ziC> . Although in §5.7 we made explicit use only of the particular case
IB) + iiC > , as a result of the reflection/transmission at half-silvered mirror, the
other combinations would not be hard to achieve. All that would be needed
would be to vary the amount of silvering on the mirror and to introduce a
segment of refracting medium in the path of one of the emerging beams. In this
way, one could build up a complete Riemann sphere's worth of possible
alternative states, given by all the various physical situations of the form
wiB > + z iC), that can be constructed from the two alternatives IB > and IC > .
    In cases such as this, the geometrical role of the Riemann sphere is not at all
an apparent one. However, there are other types of situation in which the
Riemann sphere's role is geometrically manifest. The clearest example of this
occurs with the spin states of a particle of spin !, such as an electron or proton.
The general state can be represented as a combination



and it turns out (choosing l i> and I ! > appropriately from the proportionality
class of physically equivalent possibilities) that this It/!) represents the state of
spin, of magnitude !h, which is right handed about the axis that points in the
direction of the very point on the Riemann sphere representing the ratio zjw.
Thus every direction in space plays a role as a possible spin direction for any
particle of spin !. Even though most states are represented, initially, as being
'mysterious complex-number-weighted combinations of alternatives' (the
alternatives being l i > and I !> ), we see that these combinations are no more
and no less mysterious than the two original ones, l i > and I !> , that we started
out with. Each is just as physically real as any of the others.
   What about states of higher spin? It turns out that things get a little more
complicated-and more mysterious! The general description that I shall give is
not a very well-known one to today's physicists, although it was pointed out in
1932 by Ettore Majorana (a brilliant Italian physicist who disappeared at the
age of 3 1 on a ship entering the Bay of Naples under circumstances that have
never been fully explained).
   Let us consider, first, what is very familiar to physicists. Suppose that we
have an atom (or particle) of spin !n. Again, we can choose the upward
direction to start with, and ask the question as to 'how much' of the atom's spin
is actually oriented in (i.e. right-handed about) that direction. There is a
standard piece of apparatus, known as a Stern-Gerlach apparatus, which
achieves such measurements by use of an inhomogeneous magnetic field.
What happens is that there are just n + 1 different possible outcomes, which
can be distinguished by the fact that the atom is found to lie in just one of n + 1
different possible beams. See Fig. 5.20. The amount of the spin that lies in the

chosen direction is determined by the particular beam in which the atom is
found to lie. When measured in units of tli the amount of spin in this direc­
tion turns out to have one of the values n, n - 2, n - 4, . . . , 2 - n, - n. Thus
the different possible states of spin, for an atom of spin in, are just the
complex-number superpositions of these possibilities. I shall denote the
various different possible results of a Stern-Gerlach measurement for spin
n + 1 , when the field direction in the apparatus is the upward vertical, as

corresponding to the respective spin values n, n - 2, n - 4, . . . , 2 - n, - n in that
direction, where in each case there are exactly n arrows in all. We can think of
each upward arrow as providing an amount tli of spin in the upward direction
and each downward arrow as providing tli in the downward direction. Adding
these values, we get the total amount of spin, in each case, obtained in a
(Stern-Gerlach) spin measurement oriented in the up/down direction.
  The general superposition of these is given by a complex combination

where the complex numbers z 0, z 1 , z 2 , . . . , z,. are not all zero. Can we represent
such a state in terms of single directions of spin which are not simply 'up' or
'down'? What Majorana in effect showed was that this is indeed possible, but
we must allow that the various arrows might point in quite independent
directions; there is no need for them to be aligned in one pair of opposite
directions, as would be the case in the result of a Stern-Gerlach measurement.
Thus, we represent the general state of spin tn as a collection of n independent
such 'arrow directions'; we may think of these as being given by n points on the
Riemann sphere, where each arrow direction is the direction out from the
centre of the sphere to the relevant point on the sphere (Fig. 5.21 ). It is
important to make clear that this is an unordered collection of points (or of
arrow directions). Thus, there is no significance to be assigned to any ordering
of the points into first, second, third, etc.
    This is a very odd picture of spin, if we are to try to think of quantum­
mechanical spin as the same phenomenon as the ordinary concept of spin that
is familiar at the classical level. The spin of a classical object like a golf ball has
                            Structure of the quantum world                             277

a well-defined axis about which the object actually spins, whereas it appears
that a quantum-level object is allowed to spin all at once about all kinds of axes
pointing in many different directions. If we try to think that a classical object is
really just the same as a quantum object, except that it is 'big' in some sense,
then we seem to be presented with a paradox. The larger the magnitude of the
spin, the more directions there are to be involved. Why, indeed, do classical
objects not spin in many different directions all at once? This is an example of
an X-mystery of quantum theory. Something comes to intervene (at an
unspecified level), and we find that most types of quantum state do not arise
(or, at least, almost never arise) at the classical level of phenomena that we can
actually perceive. In the case of spin, what we find is that the only states that
significantly persist at the classical level are those in which the arrow directions
are mainly clustered about one particular direction: the spin direction (axis) of
the classically spinning object.
   There is something called the 'correspondence principle' in quantum theory
that asserts, in effect, that when physical quantities (such as the magnitude of
spin) get large, then it is possible for the system to behave in a way that closely
approximates classical behaviour (such as with the state where the arrows
roughly point all in the same direction). However, this principle does not tell
us how such states can arise solely by action of the Schrodinger equation U. In
fact 'classical states' almost never arise in this way. The classical-like states
come about because of the action of a different procedure: state-vector
reduction R.


         5 . 1 1 Position and momentum of a particle
There is an even more clear-cut example of this sort of thing in the quantum­
mechanical concept of location for a particle. We have seen that a particle's
278                       Structure of the quantum world

state can involve superpositions of two or more different locations. (Recall the
discussion of §5.7, in which a photon's state is such that it can be located in two
different beams simultaneously after it encounters a half-silvered mirror.)
Such superpositions could apply also to any other kind of particle-simple or
composite-like an electron, a proton, an atom, or a molecule. Moreover,
there is nothing in the U part of the formalism of quantum theory that says
that large objects such as golf balls cannot also find themselves in such
confused states of location. But we do not see golf balls in superpositions of
several locations all at once, any more than we find a golf ball whose state of
spin can be about several axes all at once. Why is it that some objects seem to
be too large or too massive or too something to be able to be 'quantum-level'
objects, and do not find themselves in such superposed states in the actual
world? In standard quantum theory, it is only the action ofR that achieves this
transition from the quantum-level superpositions of potential alternatives to a
single, actual, classical outcome. The mere action of U by itself would almost
invariably lead to 'unreasonable-looking' classical superpositions. (I shall
return to this issue in §6. 1 .)
   At the quantum level, on the other hand, those states of a particle for which
it has no clear-cut location can play a fundamental role. For if the particle has
a clear-cut momentum (so it is moving in a clearly defined way in some
direction and not in a superposition of several different directions all at once),
then its state must involve a superposition of all different positions all at once.
(This is a particular feature of the Schrodinger equation which would require
too much technicality for an explanation to be appropriate here; cf. ENM,
pp. 243-50 and Dirac (1947), Davies (1984), for example. It is closely
connected, also, with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which provides limits
to how clearly defined can be position and momentum simultaneously.) In fact
the states of well-defined momentum have an oscillatory spatial behaviour, in
the direction of motion, which was the feature that we ignored in the
discussion of photon states given in §5. 7. Strictly speaking, 'oscillatory' is not
quite the appropriate term. It turns out that the 'oscillations' are not like the
linear vibrations of a string, in which one could imagine that the complex
weighting factors oscillate backwards and forwards through the origin in the
complex plane, but instead these factors are pure phases (see Fig. 5.18) that
circle about the origin at a constant rate-this rate giving a frequency v that is
proportional to the particle's energy E, in accordance with Planck's famous
formula E = hv. (See Fig. 6. 1 1 of ENM, for a pictorial 'corkscrew' represen­
tation of momentum states.) These matters, important though they are for
quantum theory, will not play any particular role in the discussions in this
 book, so the reader may happily ignore them here.
    More generally, the complex weighting factors need not have this particular
'oscillatory' form, but can vary from point to point in an arbitrary manner.

                                  5 . 1 2 Hilbert space
In order to be a little more explicit (and accurate) about how the procedure R
is taken to act, in standard quantum-mechanical descriptions, it will be
necessary to resort to a certain (relatively minor) degree of mathematical
technicality. The family of all possible states of a quantum system constitute
what is known as a Hilbert space. It will not be necessary to explain what this
means in full mathematical detail, but a bit of understanding of Hilbert-space
notions will help to clarify our picture of the quantum world.
   The first and most important property of a Hilbert space is that it is a
complex vector space. All this really means is that we are allowed to perform
the complex-number-weighted combinations that we have been considering
for quantum states. I shall continue to use the Dirac 'ket' notion for elements of
the Hilbert space, so if II/I> and 14> ) are both elements of the Hilbert space, then
so also is wii/J) + z lc/> ), for any pair of complex numbers w and z. Here, we even
allow w = z = 0, to give the element 0 of the Hilbert space, this being the one
Hilbert-space element that does not represent a possible physical state. We
have the normal algebraic rules for a vector space, these being
                                  II/I> + 1 4> > = 14> > + II/I> .
                       II/I > + < l ei> > + l x > ) = < II/I> + 14> > ) + l x >.
                                       w(zlt/1)) = (wz )II/I),
                                (w + z) l t/1) = wii/J> + zii/J),
                             z(lt/1) + 14> )) = zl t/1) + z lc/> ),
                                         Olt/1) = 0,
                                             z0 = 0,
which more or less means that we can use the algebraic notation in the way
that we would expect to use it.
   A Hilbert space can sometimes have a.finite number of dimensions, as in the
case of the spin states of a particle. For spin !. the Hilbert space is just two
dimensional, its elements being the complex linear combinations of the two
states li> and ID- For spin !n, the Hilbert space is (n + 1 ) dimensional.
However, sometimes the Hilbert space can have an infinite number of
dimensions as would be the case for the states of position of a particle. Here,
each alternative position that the particle might have counts as providing a
separate dimension for the Hilbert space. The general state describing the
quantum location of the particle is a complex-number superposition of all
these different individual positions (the wavefunction for the particle), In fact
there are certain mathematical complications that arise for this kind of
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space which would confuse the discussion

      Euclidean space, then we can represent the sum of two vectors ll/1> and
      1¢) in terms of the ordinary parallelogram law (in the plane of 0,

unnecessarily, so I shall concentrate here mainly on the finite-dimensional
case.
   When we try to visualize a Hilbert space, we encounter two difficulties. In
the first place, these spaces tend to have rather too many dimensions for our
direct imagination, and in the second, they are complex rather than real spaces.
Nevertheless, it is often handy to ignore these problems temporarily, in order
to develop an intuition about the mathematics. Let us therefore pretend, for
the moment, that we can use our normal two- or three-dimensional pictures to
represent a Hilbert space. In Fig. 5.22, the operation oflinear superposition is
illustrated geometrically in the real three-dimensional case.
   Recall that a quantum-state vector II/I > represents the same physical
situation as any complex multiple ult/J), where u # 0. In terms of our pictures,
this means that a particular physical situation is actually represented not by a
point in Hilbert space, but by the whole line-referred to as a ray-which joins
the Hilbert-space point II/I > to the origin 0. See Fig. 5.23; but we must bear in
mind that, owing to the fact that Hilbert spaces are complex rather than real,
although a ray looks like an ordinary one-dimensional line, it is really an entire
complex plane.
   So far, we have been concerned with Hilbert space only with regard to its
structure as a complex vector space. There is another property that a Hilbert
space has, which is almost as crucial as its vector-space structure, and which is
essential for the description of the reduction procedure R. This other Hilbert­
space property is the Hermitian scalar product (or inner product), which can be
applied to any pair of Hilbert-space vectors to produce a single complex
number. This operation enables us to express two important things. The first is
the notion of squared length of a Hilbert-space vector-as the scalar product of
the vector with itself. A normalized state (which, as we noted above, cf. §5.8,
p. 264, was needed for the squared modulus rule to be strictly applicable) is
given by a Hilbert-space vector whose squared length is unity. The second

                                    complex plane.


important thing that the scalar product gives us is the notion of orthogonality
between Hilbert-space vectors-and this occurs when the scalar product of the
two vectors is zero. Orthogonality between vectors may be thought of as their
being, in some appropriate sense, 'at right angles' to each other. In ordinary
terms, orthogonal states are things that are independent of one another. The
importance of this concept for quantum physics is that the different alternative
outcomes of any measurement are always orthogonal to each other.
   Examples of orthogonal states are the states I i ) and I !) that we encountered
in the case of a particle of spin !. (Note that Hilbert-space orthogonality does
not normally correspond to the notion of perpendicularity in ordinary spatial
terms; in the case of spin !. the orthogonal states l i > and I! > represent physical
configurations that are oppositely, rather than perpendicularly, oriented.)
Other examples are afforded by the states I ii . . j) , I! i . . . j), . . , I !! . . . !),
                                                       .                              .



that we encountered for spin !n, each of which is orthogonal to all of the
others. Also orthogonal are all different possible positions that a quantum
particle might be located in. Moreover, the states IB> and iiC), of §5.7, that
arose as the transmitted and reflected parts of a photon's state, emerging after
the photon has encountered a half-silvered mirror, are orthogonal, and so also
are the two states iiD> and - IE> that these two evolve into upon reflection by
the two fully silvered mirrors.
   This last fact illustrates an important property of Schrodinger evolution U.
Any two states that are initially orthogonal will remain orthogonal if each is
evolved, according to U, over the same period of time. Thus, the property of
orthogonality is preserved by U. Furthermore, U actually preserves the value
of the scalar product between states. Technically, this is what the term unitary
evolution actually means.
   As mentioned above, the key role of orthogonality is that whenever a
282                         Structure of the quantum world

'measurement' is performed on a quantum system, then the various possible
quantum states that separately lead-upon magnification to the classical
level-to distinguishable outcomes are necessarily orthogonal to one another.
This, in particular, applies to null measurements, as in the bomb-testing
problem of §5.2 and §5.9. The non-detection of a particular quantum state, by
some apparatus that is capable of detecting that state, will result in the
quantum state 'j umping' to something that is orthogonal to the very state that
the detector is poised to detect.
   As has just been said, orthogonality is mathematically expressed as the
vanishing of the scalar product between states. This scalar product, generally,
is a complex number that is assigned to any pair of elements of the Hilbert
space. If the two elements (states) are II/I> and 14> ), then this complex number is
written ( r/1 14>). The scalar product satisfies a number of simple algebraic
properties that we can write (slightly awkwardly) as
                                        < rfJ I4> > = <4>1 1/1> ,
                       < rfJ I < I4> > + l x > ) = < r/1 14> > + < rfJ i x > .
                                 (z ( r/11) 14> > = z ( r/1 14> ),
                              ( r/l l r/1) > 0 unless I I/I) = 0;
moreover, it can be deduced that (r/l l r/I) = O if l r/1) = 0. I do not wish to trouble
the reader with the details of such matters here. (For these, I refer the
interested reader to any standard text on quantum theory; see, for example,
Dirac (1947).)
   The essential things that we shall require of the scalar product here are the
two properties (definitions) alluded to above:
              I I/I) and 14>) are orthogonal if and only if ( r/114>) = 0,
                         < rfJ ir/1> is the squared length of l r/1).
We note that the relationship of orthogonality is symmetrical between II/I > and
14>) (because ( r/1 14>) = <4>1 1/1> ). Moreover, (r/l l r/1> is always a non-negative real
number, so it has a non-negative square root that we can refer to as the length
(or magnitude) of l r/1).
   Since we can multiply any state vector by a non-zero complex number
without changing its physical interpretation, we can always normalize the state
so that it has unit length to make it a unit vector or normalized state. There
remains, however, the ambiguity that the state vector can be multiplied by a
pure phase (a number of the form ei8, with () real; cf. §5.10).

            5 . 1 3 The Hilbert-space description of R
How do we represent the operation of R in terms of Hilbert space? Let us
consider the simplest case of a measurement, which is a 'yes/no' measurement,
                           Structure of the quantum world                         283

where some piece of apparatus registers YES if it positively indicates that the
measured quantum object has some property, and NO if it fails to register this
fact (or, equivalently, that it positively registers that the quantum object does
not have this property). This includes th� possibility, that I shall be concerned
mainly with here, that the NO alternative might be a null measurement. For
example, some of the photon detectors of §5.8 performed measurements of this
kind. They would register YES if the photon is received and NO if it is not
received. In this case, the NO measurement is indeed a null measurement-but
it is a measurement nevertheless, which causes the state to 'jump' into
something that is orthogonal to what it would have been had a YES answer
been obtained. Likewise, the Stern-Gerlach spin measurers of §5. 10, for an
atom of spin �. could be directly of this kind; we could say that the result is YES
if the atom's spin is measured to be It > , which occurs if it is found in the beam
corresponding to li> , and NO if it is not found in this beam, whence the result
must be orthogonal to It > , so it must be I!>·
    More complicated measurements can always be thought ofas built up out of
a succession of yes/no measurements. Consider an atom of spin �n, for
example. In order to obtain the n + 1 different possibilities for a measurement
of the amount of spin in the upward direction, we can ask, first, whether the
spin state is I ii . . . j). We do this by trying to detect the atom in the beam
corresponding to this 'completely up' spin state. If we get YES, then we are
finished; but if we get NO, then this is a null measurement, and we can go on to
ask whether the spin is I ! i . . . j), and so on. In each case the NO answer is to
be a null measurement, indicating simply that the YES answer has not been
obtained. In more detail, suppose the state is initially


and we ask if the spin is entirely 'up'. If we find the answer YES, then we
ascertain the state to be indeed I iii . . . j) or, rather, we may have to consider
that it just jumps' to I iii . . . j ) upon measurement. But if we find the answer
NO, then, as a result of this null measurement, we have to consider that the
state jumps' to the orthogonal state


and we try again, in order to ascertain, now, whether the state is I ! ii . . . j). If
we now obtain YES, then we say that the state is indeed I! ii . . . j), or else we
say that the state has 'j umped' to I ! ii . . . j). But if we find NO, then the state
'jumps' to


and so on.
  This 'j umping' that the state vector indulges in-or at least seems to indulge
in-is the most puzzling aspect of quantum theory. It is probably fair to say
284                              Structure of the quantum world

that most quantum physicists either find 'j umping' very hard to accept as a
feature of actual physical reality, or else refuse altogether to accept that reality
can behave in this absurd way. Nevertheless, it is an essential feature of the
quantum formalism, whatever viewpoint one might hold to as to the 'reality'
involved.
    In my descriptions above, I have relied on what is sometimes referred to as
the projection postulate, which specifies the form that this 1umping' must take
(e.g. zo l ii . . . j) + z 1 l !i . . . i ) + . . . + z,.l !! . . . ! ) 'j umps' to z 1 l ! i . . . j) +
. . . + z,.l !! . . . ! ) ). We shall see the geometrical reason for this terminology in a
moment. Some physicists claim that the projection postulate is an inessential
assumption in quantum theory. They generally refer, however, to measure­
ments in which the quantum state is disturbed by some physical interaction,
and not to a null measurement. Such a disturbance occurs when, in the above
examples, the answer YES is obtained, as when a photon detector absorbs a
photon in order to register, or when an atom, after passing through a
Stem-Gerlach apparatus, is measured actually to be in one particular beam
(i.e. YES). For a null measurement of the type that I am considering here
(answer NO), the projection postulate is indeed essential, for without it one
cannot ascertain what quantum theory (correctly) asserts must happen for the
ensuing measurements.
    To be more explicit about what the projection postulate asserts, let us see
what the Hilbert-space description of all this is. I shall consider a particular
kind of measurement-which I shall call a primitive measurement-in which
the measurement is of yes/no type, but where the YES answer ascertains that
the quantum state is-or has just 'j umped to'-some particular state Ia:> (or to
some non-zero multiple of this, ula: > ). Thus, for a primitive measurement, the
YES answer determines the physical state to be one particular thing, whereas
there might be several alternative things that elicit the answer NO. The above
spin measurements, whereby one tries to ascertain whether the spin is in a
particular state, such as I!! j . . . j), are examples of primitive measurements.
    The NO answer, for a primitive measurement, projects the state to
something that is orthogonal to Ia:). We see the geometrical picture of this
indicated in Fig. 5.24. The original state is taken to be lt/1), depicted by the
large arrow, and as a result of the measurement it either 'j umps' to a multiple of
Ia:), when the answer is YES, or else projects down to the space orthogonal to
Ia:), when the answer is NO. In the case of NO, there is no question but that,
according to standard quantum theory, this is indeed what we must consider
the state to do. In the case of YES, however, the situation is complicated by the
fact that the quantum system has now interacted with the measuring
apparatus, and the state has become something much more intricate than just
Ia:). In fact, the state generally evolves into what is called an entangled state,
which intertwines the original quantum system with the measuring apparatus.
 (Entangled states will be discussed in §5. 1 7). Nevertheless, the quantum state's
                           Structure of the quantum world                           285




      Fig. 5.24. A primitive measurement projects the state ltfr> into a multiple
      of the chosen state lex> (YES) or into the orthogonal complement of
                                      lex) (NO).

evolution would need to proceed as though it had indeed jumped to a multiple
of Ia ) , so that the succeeding evolution can proceed unambiguously.
     We can express this jumping in the following algebraic way. The state vector
It/! > can always be written (uniquely, if Ia > is given) as
                                     It/! > = zl a > + l x > ,
where l x > is orthogonal to I a ) . The vector z la > is the orthogonal projection of
It/! > on the ray determined by Ia) , and l x > is the orthogonal projection of It/! >
into the orthogonal complement space of Ia > (i.e. into the space of all vectors
orthogonal to Ia > ). If the result of the measurement is YES, then the state
vector must be considered to have jumped to zl a > (or simply to Ia) ) as the
starting point of the ensuing evolution; if it is NO, then it jumps to l x > .
   How do we obtain the probabilities that are to be assigned to these two
alternative outcomes? In order to use the 'squared modulus rule' that we
encountered before, we now demand that Ia > is a unit vector, and choose some
unit vector 14>) in the direction of l x >. so that l x > = wl<f> ) . We now have
                                It/! > = zl a > + wi <J> ),
(where in fact z = ( alt/1 > and w = <4>11/1 )) and we can obtain the relative
probabilities of YES and NO as the ratio of lzl 2 to l wl 2 • If It/!) itself is a unit
vector, then lzl 2 and lwl 2 are the actual probabilities of YES and NO,
respectively.
    There is another way of phrasing this, which is a little simpler in the present
context (and I leave it as an exercise for the interested reader to verify that this
is indeed equivalent). To obtain the actual probability of each ofthe outcomes
YES or NO, we simply examine the squared length of the vector It/! > (not
assumed to be normalized to a unit vector) and see by what proportion this
squared length is reduced in each of its respective projections. The reduction
factor, in each case, is the required probability.
286                          Structure of the quantum world

  Finally, it should be mentioned that for a general yes/no measurement (now
not necessarily a primitive measurement), in which the YES states need not
belong to just a single ray, the discussion is essentially similar. There would be
a YES subspace Y and a NO subspace N. These subspaces would be
orthogonal complements of each other-in the sense that each vector of one is
orthogonal to every vector of the other, and that together they span the whole
original Hilbert space. The projection postulate asserts that, upon measure­
ment, the original vector II/I > gets orthogonally projected into Y when a YES
answer is obtained and into N for a NO answer. Again the respective
probabilities are given by the factors by which the squared length of the state
vector gets reduced on projection (see ENM, p. 263, Fig. 6.23). The status of
the projection postulate is a little less clear here than for the null measurement
above, however, because with an affirmative measurement, the resulting state
gets entangled with the state of the measuring apparatus. For such reasons, in
the discussions which follow, I shall stick to the simpler primitive measure­
ments, in which the YES space consists of a single ray (multiples of II/I)). This
will be sufficient for our needs.




                   5 . 14 Commuting measurements

In general, with successive measurements on a quantum system, the order in
which these measurements are performed can be important. Measurements
for which the order of operation indeed makes a difference to the resulting
state vectors are called non-commuting. If the ordering of the measurements
plays no role whatever (there being not even a phase factor of difference), then
we say that they commute. In terms of Hilbert space, we can understand this in
terms of the fact that with successive orthogonal projections of a given state
vector I I/I), the final result will generally depend upon the order in which these
projections are performed. For commuting measurements, the ordering
makes no difference.
   What happens with primitive measurements? It is not hard to see that the
condition for a pair of distinct primitive measurements to commute is that the
YES ray of one of the measurements is orthogonal to the YES ray of the other.
   For example, with the primitive spin measurements considered in §5. 10,
that were to be performed on an atom of spin -!n, the ordering is indeed
irrelevant. This is the case because the various states under consideration,
namely I ii . . . j), l !i . . . j), . . . , I !! . . . ! ) are all orthogonal to one another.
Thus, the particular ordering for the primitive measurements that I chose
plays no role in the final outcome, and the measurements do all commute.
However, this would not generally have been the case if the various spin
                           Structure of the quantum world                        287

measurements had been taken in different directions. These would not
generally commute.



                5 . 1 5 The quantum-mechanical 'and'
There is a standard procedure, in quantum mechanics, for treating systems
that involve more than one independent part. This procedure will be
necessary, in particular, for the quantum discussion (to be given in §5. 1 8) of
the system that consists of the two widely separated particles of spin i that
Quintessential Trinkets placed at the centres of the two magic dodecahedra of
§5.3. It is also needed, for example, for the quantum-mechanical description of
a detector, as it begins to get entangled with the quantum state of the particle
that it is detecting.
   Consider, first, a system that consists of just two independent (non­
interacting) parts. We shall assume that each, in the absence of the other,
would be described, respectively, by a state vector I IX) and by a state vector IP>.
How are we to describe the combined system in which both are present? The
normal procedure is to form what is called the tensor product (or outer
product) of these vectors, written


We can think of this product as providing what is the standard quantum­
mechanical way of representing the normal notion of 'and', in the sense that
the two independent quantum systems represented, respectively, by IIX) and
IP> . are now both present at the same time. (For example, IIX> might represent
an electron being at a location A and IP> might represent a hydrogen atom
being at some distant location B. The state in which the electron is at A and the
hydrogen atom is at B would then be represented by IIX>IP>.) The quantity
IIX>IP> is a single quantum state vector, say l x > . however, and it would be
legitimate to write


for example.
   It should be emphasized that this concept of 'and' is completely different
from quantum linear superposition, which would have the quantum
description IIX> + IP> or, more generally, z liX) + wiP> where z and w are
complex weighting factors. For example, if IIX > and IP> are possible states of a
single photon, say being located at A and being located at a quite different
place B, respectively, then IIX> + I P> is also a possible state for a single photon,
whose location is divided between A and B accordil}g to the strange
prescriptions of quantum theory-not for two photons. A pair of photons, one
at A and one at B, would be represented by the state I IX>IP>.
288                           Structure of the quantum world

  The tensor product satisfies the sort of algebraic rules that one would expect
of a 'product'
                       (z ltx > )IP > = z (ltx > IP>) = ltx > (zi P > ),
                                   (ltx > + I Y > )IP > = ltx > IP> + I Y > IP > .
                                   ltx > (IP > + I Y > ) = ltx >I P > + l tx >I Y > .
                                        (ltx > IP > )I Y > = ltx > (IP >I Y > ),
except that it is not strictly correct to write 'ltx >I P > = IP > Itx)'. However, it would
be unreasonable to think of interpreting the word 'and' in a quantum­
mechanical context as implying that the combined system 'ltx) and I P > ' is
physically any different from the combined system 'IP > and ltx)'. We get
around this problem by delving a little more deeply into the way that
quantum-level Nature actually behaves. Instead of interpreting the state
ltx >I P > as what mathematicians call the 'tensor product', I shall henceforth
interpret the notation 'ltx > IP > ' to involve what mathematical physicists refer to,
these days, as the Grassmann product. We then have the additional rule that
                                       IP > Itx > = ± ltx >I P > .
where the minus sign occurs precisely when both the states ltx) and IP> have an
odd number of particles whose spin is not an integer. (The spin of such particles
has one of the values �. !. %, i, . . . , these particles being referred to asfermions.
Particles of spin 0, 1 , 2, 3, . . . are called bosons, and these do not contribute to
the sign in this expression.) There is no need for the reader to be concerned
about this technicality here. As far as the physical state is concerned, with this
description, 'ltx) and IP>' is indeed the same as 'IP > and ltx)'.
   For states involving three or more independent parts, we just repeat this
procedure. Thus, with three parts, whose individual states are ltx), IP> . and l y ),
the state in which all three parts are present at the same time would be written
as
                                              ltx > IP > I Y >.
this being the same as what I have written above (interpreted in terms of
Grassmann products) as (ltx >I P > )I Y > or, equivalently, ltx > (IP >I Y )). The case of
four or more independent parts is similar.
   An important property of Schrodinger evolution U, for systems ltx) and IP >
that are not interacting with one another, is that the evolution of the combined
system is just the combined evolution of the individual systems. Thus, if after a
certain time t, the system ltx) would (by itself) evolve into ltx'), and if IP> (by
itself) would evolve into IP'), then the combined system ltx > IP > would, after this
same time t, evolve into ltx')IP'). Moreover (consequently), if there are three
non-interacting parts ltx), IP> . and I Y > of a system ltx >I P >Iy ), and the parts
                             Structure of the quantum world                           289

 evolve, respectively, into Ia'), IP') and li>, then the combined system would
 likewise evolve into la' >I P' > Ii>· The same holds for four or more parts.
    Note that this is very similar to the linearity property of U that was referred
 to in §5.7, according to which superposed states evolve precisely as the
 superposition of the evolutions of the individual states. For example, Ia> + IP >
 would evolve into Ia') + IP'). However, it is important to realize that this is
 quite a different thing. There is no particular surprise involved in the fact that a
 total system that is composed of non-interacting independent parts should
 evolve, as a whole, as though each separate part were oblivious ofthe presence
 of each of the others. It is essential for this that the parts should indeed be non­
 interacting with each other, otherwise this property would be false. The
 linearity property, on the other hand, is a genuine surprise. Here, according to
 U, the superposed systems evolve in total obliviousness of each of the others,
 quite independently of whether there are any interactions involved. This fact
 alone might lead us to question the absolute truth of the linearity property. Yet
 it is very well confirmed for phenomena that remain entirely at the quantum
 level. It is only the operation of R that seems to violate it. We shall return to
 this matter later.



                 5 . 1 6 Orthogonality of product states
  There is a certain awkwardness that arises with product states, as I have given
  them, in relation to the notion of orthogonality. If we have two orthogonal
  states Ia > and IP > , then we might expect that the states l t/l> la> and lt/I>IP >
  should also be orthogonal, for any lt/1). For example, Ia > and IP > might be the
  two alternative states that are available to a photon, where perhaps the state
  Ia > would be the one detected by some photocell and where the orthogonal
  state IP> is the infe"ed state of the photon when the photocell fails to detect
  anything (null measurement). Now, we might consider the photon to be just
  one part of a combined system, where we simply adjoin some other objects­
  which could be another photon, say, somewhere on the moon, for example­
  the state of this other object being lt/1). In this case we get, for this combined
  system, the two alternative states lt/1 > Ia) and lt/1 > IP > . The mere inclusion of the
. state lt/1) in the description should surely make no difference to the
  orthogonality of these two states. Indeed, with the normal 'tensor product'
  definition of product states (as opposed to some kind of Grassmann product,
  as used here) this would indeed be the case, and the orthogonality of lifl > la >
  and lt/I>IP> would follow from the orthogonality of Ia > and IP>·
     However, the way that Nature actually seems to behave, according t o the
  full procedures of quantum theory, is not quite so straightforward as this. If the
  state lt/1> could be considered to be totally independent of both Ia> and I P >.
  then its presence would indeed be irrelevant. But, technically, even the state of
290                           Structure of the quantum world

a photon on the moon cannot be regarded as completely separate from the one
that is involved in the detection by our photocell.* (This has to do with the use
of a Grassmann-type product in the ' lt/J > IIX)' notation used here-more
familiarly, it has to do with the 'Bose statistics' that is involved with photon
states, or other boson states, or else with the 'Fermi statistics' that is involved
with electron, proton, or other fermion states, cf. ENM pp.277, 278 and, say,
Dirac 1947.) If we were to be completely accurate according to the rules of the
theory, we should have to consider all the photons in the universe when
discussing the state of but a single photon. Nevertheless, to an extremely high
degree of accuracy, this is (fortunately) not necessary. We shall indeed take it
that, with any state lt/1) that has evidently nothing to do with the problem at
hand, where this problem directly concerns only the orthogonal states IIX) and
IP>, the states lt/I>IIX) and lt/I>I P > will indeed be orthogonal (even with
Grassmann-type products) to a very high degree of accuracy.


                      5 . 1 7 Quantum entanglement
We shall need to understand the quantum physics governing EPR effects-the
quantum-mechanical Z-mysteries exemplified by the magic dodecahedra of
§5.3, cf. §5 .4. We must also come to terms with the basic X-mystery of
quantum theory-the paradoxical relationship between the two processes U
and R which underlies the measurement problem which we shall discuss in the
next chapter. For both of these, it will be necessary for me to introduce one
further important idea: that of entangled states.
   Let us first try to see what is involved in a simple process of measurement.
Consider a situation where a photon is in a superposed state, say IIX) + IP> .
where the state IIX > would activate a detector, but where the state IP> .
orthogonal to IIX), would leave the detector undisturbed. (An example of this
kind of thing was considered in §5.8, when the detector at G encountered the
state I G) + i i F). Here, IG > would activate the detector whereas i i F > would
leave it undisturbed.) I am going to suppose that the detector itself can also be
assigned a quantum state, say I\!'). This is the usual practice in quantum
theory. It is not altogether clear to me that it really makes sense to assign a
quantum-mechanical description to a classical-level object, but this is not
normally questioned in discussions of this kind. In any case, we may suppose
that the elements of the detector that the photon would initially encounter are
indeed things that can be treated according to the standard rules of quantum
theory. Those who are in any doubt about treating the detector as a whole

         *Curiously, this type of phenomenon can have a profound relevance to actual
      observations. The effect due to Hanbury Brown and Twiss (1 954, 1956), according
      to which the diameters of certain nearby stars have been measured, depends upon
      this 'boson' property interrelating photons reaching the earth from opposite sides of
      the star!
                           Structure of the quantum world                         29 1

according to these rules should consider that it is these initial quantum-level
elements (particles, atoms, molecules) to which this state vector I'�'> refers.
    Just before the photon reaches the detector (or, rather, just before the
IIX)-portion of the photon's wavefunction reaches the detector), the physical
situation consists of the detector state and the photon state, namely
I'�'>(IIX> + IP> ); and we find
                        I'�'> < IIX> + IP> ) = I'�'>IIX> + I'�'>IP>.
This is a superposition of the state I'�'>IIX), which describes the detector
(elements) and approaching photon, with the state I'�'>IP>, which describes the
detector (elements) and photon elsewhere. Suppose that next, in accordance
with Schrodinger evolution U, the state I'�'>IIX> (detector with approaching
photon) becomes some new state 1'¥ v) (indicating that the detector registers a
YES answer), by virtue of the interactions that the photon has with the
detector elements after it encounters them. We shall also suppose that if
the photon does not encounter the detector, the action of U provides that the
detector state I'�'> would, by itself, evolve into I'¥N ) (detector registering NO)
and IP> would evolve into IP'). Then, by the properties of Schrodinger
evolution that were referred to in the previous section, the entire state would
become


    This is a particular example of an entangled state, where 'entanglement'
refers to the fact that the entire state cannot be written simply as a product of a
state for one of the subsystems (photon) with a state for the other subsystem
(detector). In fact, the state l'�'v> itself is likely to be a state entangled, in any
case, with its own environment, but this depends on the details of further
interactions, not of relevance here.
    We note that the states I'�'>IIX> and I'�'>IP> whose superposition represented
the state of the combined system just before interaction are (essentially)
orthogonal-since IIX> and IP> are themselves orthogonal, with I'�'> being
totally independent of either of them. Thus, the states, namely 1'¥ v) and
I'�'N >IP'), into which these two evolve by the action ofU, must themselves also
be orthogonal. (U always preserves orthogonality.) The state l'�'v> could
evolve further into something that is macroscopically observable, such as an
audible 'click', indicating that the photon has indeed been detected, whereas if
no click results, the state must have been-i.e. must be considered to have
'jumped' to-the orthogonal possibility I'�' N >IP'). If no click occurs, then the
mere counterfactual possibility that it might have occurred, but did not, would
cause the state to 'j ump' to 1'¥ N >IP'), which is now not an entangled state. The
null measurement has disentangled the state.
    A characteristic feature of entangled states is that the 'j umping' that occurs
with the operation of R can have a seemingly non-local (or even apparently
292                        Structure of the quantum world

retro-active) action that is even more puzzling than that of a simple null
measurement. Such non-locality occurs particularly with what is referred to as
an EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) effect. These are genuine quantum
puzzles that are among the most baffling of the theory's Z-mysteries. The idea
came originally from Einstein, in an attempt to show that the formalism of
quantum theory could not possibly provide a complete description of Nature.
Many different versions of the EPR phenomenon have subsequently been put
forward (such as the magic dodecahedra of §5.3), a number of which have been
directly confirmed by experiment as being features of the actual workings of
the world in which we live (cf. §5.4).
   EPR effects arise with the following type of situation. Consider a known
initial state jn), of a physical system, which evolves (by U) into a
superposition of two orthogonal states, each of which is the product of a pair
of independent states describing a pair of spatially separated physical parts, so
jn) evolves into, say, the entangled state
                                  l t/l> la > + 1 4> > IP>·
We shall suppose that jl/1) and 1 4>> are orthogonal possibilities for one o f the
parts, and that ja) and IP > are orthogonal possibilities for the other. A
measurement which ascertains whether the first part is in the state jl/1) or 1 4>>
will instantaneously determine that the second part is in the corresponding
state ja) or IP > .
   So far this is nothing mysterious. One could argue that the situation is just
like the good Dr Bertlmann's socks (§5.4). In the knowledge that his two socks
must differ in colour-and let us suppose that today we know that he has
chosen to wear a pink and a green one-the observation as to whether his left
sock is green (state jl/1)) or else pink (state 1 4> )) will instantaneously determine
that his right sock is correspondingly either pink (state ja)) or green (state IP> ).
However, the effects of quantum entanglement can differ profoundly from this,
and no explanation of the 'Bertlmann socks' type can account for all the
observational effects. The problems arise when we have the option to perform
alternative kinds of measurement on the two parts of the system.
   An example will illustrate the kind of thing that is involved. Suppose that
the initial state jn0) describes the spin state of some particle as being spin 0.
This particle then decays into two new particles, each of spin !, which move
away from each other to a great distance apart, to the left and to the right.
From the properties of angular momentum and its conservation, it follows
that the spin directions of the two separating particles must be opposite to each
 other, and, for the zero-spin state into which jn0) evolves, we find
                           jn > = j L t >I R !> - I L! > I R i>.
where ' L' refers to the left-hand particle and 'R' to the right-hand one (and the
minus sign arises with standard conventions). Thus, if we choose to measure
                           Structure of the quantum world                        293

the spin of the left-hand particle in the upward direction, the answer YES (i.e.
finding I L j )) would automatically put the right-hand particle in the state I R!>
of downward spin. The answer NO ( I L!>) would automatically put the right­
hand particle into the state of upward spin (!R j) ). It seems that a measurement
of one particle in one place can instantaneously affect the state of a quite
different particle in a quite different place-but so far this is nothing more
mysterious than are Bertlmann's socks!
   However, our entangled state can also be represented in another way,
corresponding to a different choice of measurement. For example, we could
choose to measure the left-hand spin, instead, in a horizontal direction, so that
YES corresponds, say, to I L+-) and NO corresponds to I L -+ ) . We now find
(by a simple calculation, cf. ENM, p. 283) that the same combined state as
before can be written in a different entangled way:



Thus we find that the YES answer on the left automatically puts the right-hand
particle in the state I R -+ ), and NO answer automatically puts it in I R +- ) . The
corresponding thing would occur whatever direction we happen to choose for
the left-hand spin measurement.
   What is remarkable about this kind of situation is that the mere choice of
spin direction on the left-hand particle appears to fix the direction of the spin
axis of the right-hand particle. In fact, until the result of the left-hand
measurement is obtained, there is no actual information that is conveyed to
the right-hand particle. Merely 'fixing the direction of the axis of spin' does
nothing, by itself alone, that is actually observable. Despite this well­
appreciated fact, it is still the case that from time to time people entertain the
thought that EPR effects might be put to use in order to send signals from one
place to another instantaneously, since the state-vector reduction R 'reduces'
the quantum state of the EPR pair of particles simultaneously, no matter how
far from each other they may be. But there is, in fact, no means of sending a
signal, by this procedure, from the left-hand particle to the right-hand one (cf.
Ghirardi et al. 1980).
   The standard use of the quantum-mechanical formalism indeed provides
the following picture: as soon as a measurement is made on one particle, say
the left-hand one, then the entire state gets reduced instantaneously from the
original entangled one-where neither particle by itselfhas a well-defined state
of spin-to one where the left-hand state is disentangled from the right-hand
one, and both spins then become well defined. In the mathematical state-vector
description, the measurement on the left does have an instantaneous effect on
the right. But, as I have indicated, this 'instantaneous effect' is not of the kind
that would allow one to send a physical signal.
   According to the principles of relativity, physical signals-being things
capable of transmitting actual information-would be necessarily constrained
294                       Structure of the quantum world

to travel with the speed oflight, or else more slowly. But EPR effects cannot be
viewed in this way . It would not be consistent with the predictions of quantum
theory for them to be treated as finitely propagated signals that are
constrained by the speed of light. (The example of the magic dodecahedra
illustrates this fact, since the entanglements between my colleague's and my
dodecahedra have immediate effects that do not have to wait the four years
that it would take a light signal to pass between us; cf. §5.3, §5.4, but also
endnote 4.) Thus, EPR effects cannot be signals in the ordinary sense.
   In view of this fact, one might wonder how it is that EPR effects actually
have any observable consequences. That they do have such consequences
follows from the famous theorem of John Bell (cf. §5.4 ). The joint probabilities
that quantum theory predicts for various possible measurements that can be
made on our two spin ! particles (with independent choices of spin direction,
on the left-hand and the right-hand particles) cannot be obtained by any
classical model of non-communicating left-hand and right-hand objects. (See
ENM, pp. 284--5 and p. 301 , for examples of this kind.) Examples such as the
magic dodecahedra of §5.3 give even stronger effects, where puzzles arise with
precise yes/no constraints, rather than merely probabilities. Thus, although
the left- and right-hand particles are not in communication with each other in
the sense of actually being able to send instantaneous messages to each other,
they are nevertheless still entangled with each other in the sense that they
cannot be considered as separate independent objects-until they are finally
disentangled by measurement. Quantum entanglement is a mysterious thing
that lies somewhere between direct communication and complete sepa­
ration-and it has no classical analogue whatever. Moreover, entanglement is
an effect that does not fall off with distance (unlike, say, the inverse square law
of gravitational or electric attraction). Einstein found the prospect of such an
effect deeply disturbing, referring to it as 'spooky action at a distance' (see
Mermin 1985).
   In fact quantum entanglement seems to be an effect that is quite oblivious
not only of space separation but also of time separation. If a measurement is
made on one component of an EPR pair before it is made on the other
component, then the first measurement is considered, in the ordinary
quantum-mechanical description, to be the one that effects the disentangle­
ment, so that the second measurement is concerned merely with the single
disentangled component that it is actually examining. However, precisely the
same observable consequences would be obtained if we were to consider that it
is the second measurement that somehow retro-actively effects the disentangle­
ment rather than the first one. Another way of expressing the irrelevance of the
temporal ordering of the two measurements is to say that they commute (see
 §5. 14).
    This kind of symmetry is a necessary feature of EPR measurements in order
that they be consistent with the observational consequences of special
relativity. Measurements that are performed at spacelike-separated events (i.e.
                             Structure of the quantum world                             295




     Fig. 5.25. Two events in space-time are called spacelike separated if each
     lies outside the other's light cone (see also Fig. 4. 1 , p. 219). In this case,
     neither can causally influence the other, and measurements made at the
                             two events must commute.

events lying outside each other's light cones; see Fig. 5.25, and the discussion
given in §4.4) must necessarily commute and it is indeed immaterial which
measurement is considered to occur 'first'-according to the firm principles of
special relativity. To see that this must be so, one can consider the whole
physical situation to be described according to the points of view of two
different observers' frames of reference, as indicated in Fig. 5.26 (cf. also EMN
p. 287). (These two 'observers' need have no relation to those who are actually
performing the measurements.) In the situation depicted, the two observers
would have opposite ideas as to which measurement was indeed the 'first' one.
With regard to EPR-type measurements, the phenomenon of quantum
296                         Structure of the quantum world

entanglement-or of disentanglement, * for that matter-heeds neither spatial
separation nor temporal ordering!

             5 . 1 8 The magic dodecahedra explained
For an EPR pair of particles of spin t, it is only in the probabilities that this
spatial or temporal non-locality appears. But quantum entanglement is really
a much more concrete and precise phenomenon than 'something merely
influencing probabilities'. Examples such as the magic dodecahedra (and
certain earlier configurations 1 0 ) show that the strange non-locality of
quantum entanglement is not just a matter of probability, but it also provides
precise yes/no effects that cannot be explained in any classical local way at all.
    Let us try to understand the quantum mechanics that actually underlies the
magic dodecahedra of §5.3. Recall that Quintessential Trinkets have
arranged, back on Betelgeuse, that a system of total spin 0 (the initial state I n > )
is split into two atoms, each of spin !, and one of these atoms has been
suspended delicately at the centre of each dodecahedron. The dodecahedra are
then carefully dispatched, one to me and the other to my colleague on
oc-Centauri, so that the spin states of the respective atoms are not disturbed­
until one or the other of us eventually performs a spin measurement on it by
pressing a button. When a button on one of the vertices of a dodecahedron is
pressed, this activates a Stern-Gerlach-type measurement on the atom at its
centre-say, by using an inhomogeneous magnetic field, as referred to in
§5. 10---and we recall that for spin !, there would be four possible outcomes
corresponding (in the case of the apparatus being oriented in the upward
direction) to the four mutually orthogonal states I iii >, I ! j j ), I !! j ), and
I !!! ). These states are distinguished as four possible locations of the atom
after it encounters the apparatus. What Quintessential Trinkets have arranged
is that when any button is pressed, the spin-measuring apparatus is oriented in
the direction (outward from the centre of the dodecahedron) of that button.
The bell rings (YES) if the atom is then found to be in the second of these four
possible locations (Fig. 5.27). That is to say (using the notation for the case of
the upward direction), it is the state I ! j j ) that evokes the YES response­
resulting in the bell ringing, followed by the magnificent pyrotechnic display­
and the three other states do not evoke any response (i.e. NO). In the case of
NO, the three remaining locations for the atom are brought together (say, by
reversing the direction of the inhomogeneous magnetic field) without the
distinctions between them having had any external disturbing effects, ready
for some other direction to be selected as a result of some other button being
pressed. We take note of the fact that each button-pressing effects a primitive
measurement, as described in §5.13.
                                                                              _.--'
                                                                                      r



        *Examples can be given (Zeilinger et al. 1 992) in which the very property of
      entanglement for a pair of particles can itself be an entangled property !

        Direction   t   of button

S pin   �


        Fig. 5.27. Quintessential Trinkets have arranged it so that when a button
        is pressed on the dodecahedron, a spin measurement is made on the spin t
        atom in that direction (taken here as 'up'), where state I t l i > would ring
        the bell (YES). If the answer is NO, the beams are recombined and the
                    measurement is repeated in some other direction.




  For two atoms of spin ! originating from the spin 0 state In), our total state
can be expressed as
    In > = I L iii >I R !H> - I L! ii> I Ri H > + I L!! i > I R ii !> - I L!H > I R iii > ·
If my atom is the right-hand one, and I find that its state is indeed I R ! j j ) ,
because the bell rings on my first press on the uppermost button, then it must
be the case that my colleague's bell must ring if he happens to choose to press
the opposite button to mine first-his state I L i !!>. Moreover, if my bellfails to
ring for that first button-pressing, then his bell must also fail to ring for the
opposite pressing.
   Now, we need to ascertain that the properties (a) and (b) of §5.3, that
Quintessential Trinkets are guaranteeing, must indeed hold for these primitive
button-pressing measurements. In Appendix C, some mathematical proper­
ties of the Majorana description of spin states are given, particularly for spin t.
which are sufficient for these purposes. lt simplifies our present discussion if we
think of the Riemann sphere as the sphere which passes through all the
dodecahedron's vertices-the dodecahedron's circumsphere. We then note
that the Majorana description of the YES state for a button pressed at some
vertex P of the dodecahedron is simply the point P itself taken twice together
with the point P * antipodal to P-which is indeed the state I ! j j ) for P taken
at the north pole. We can label this YES state IP* PP) .
   A key property of spin � is that the YES states for the primitive
measurements corresponding to button-presses on two next-to-adjacent
vertices of the dodecahedron are orthogonal. Why is this so? We must
ascertain that the Majorana states IA * AA) and IC * CC) are actually
orthogonal whenever A and C are next to adjacent on the dodecahedron. Now
it will be seen from Fig. 5.28 that A and C are next to adjacent on the
dodecahedron whenever they are adjacent vertices of a cube that lies inside the
dodecahedron, sharing its centre and eight of its vertices. By Appendix C, final

and C are adjacent vertices of a cube, so the result is established.
   What does this tell us? It tells us, in particular, that the three button­
pressings on the three vertices that are adjacent to a SELECTED vertex are all
commuting measurements (§5. 14), these vertices being all mutually next to
adjacent. Thus, the order in which they are pressed makes no difference to the
outcome. Now the ordering is also irrelevant for my colleague on oc-Centauri.
If he happens to choose the opposite vertex to mine as his SELECTED one,
then his three possible button-pressings are opposite to my three. By what has
been said above, my bell and his bell must ring on opposite vertices­
irrespective of either of our orderings-or else neither our bells can ring at all
on these pressings. This establishes (a).
   What about (b)? We note that the Hilbert space for spin i is four
dimensional, so that the three mutually orthogonal possibilities for which my
bell might ring, say j A * AA), j C*CC), and j G*GG)-where my SELECTED
vertex is taken to be B (see Fig. 5.29)----d o not quite exhaust the alternative
possible occurrences. The remaining possibility occurs when the bell does not
ring at all on these pressings, and we have the resulting null measurement (bell
failing to ring on all three) that ascertains that the state is the (unique) state
mutually orthogonal to all of j A*AA), j C * CC), j G*GG) . Let us label this
state j RST), where the three points R, S, T on the Riemann sphere provide its
Majorana description. The actual location of these three points is not
altogether easy to ascertain. (They were located explicitly by Jason Zimba
(1993 ). ) It does not matter exactly where they are for the present argument. All
that we need to know is that they are in positions that are determined by the
geometry of the dodecahedron in relation to the SELECTED vertex B. Thus,
in particular (by symmetry), had I chosen the vertex B * , antipodal to B, as my
SELECTED vertex, instead of choosing B, then the state j R * S * T * )-where
R*, S*, T* are antipodal to R, S, T-would have arisen as a result of the bell
failing to ring at all three vertices A * , C * , G * , each adjacent to B * .
   Now let us suppose that my colleague SELECTS the vertex B on his
                           Structure of the quantum world                            299

dodecahedron, corresponding exactly to the vertex B that I SELECT on mine.
If the bell fails to rung on any of his three, A, C, G, that are adjacent to his B,
then his (communting) measurements successively force my atom to be in a
state that is orthogonal to the three that correspond to button-pressings on my
opposite vertices A*, C * , G * , i.e. my atom is forced into state IR * S*T*).
However, if my bell also fails to ring on any of my three button-pressings at A,
C, G, then this forces my state to be IRST). But by property C.l of Appendix C
(p. 303), IRST) is orthogonal to IR *S*T* ), so it is impossible for our bells to
fail to ring on all six of these button-pressings, establishing (b).
   This explains how Quintessential Trinkets have been able to use quantum
entanglement to guarantee both properties (a) and (b). Now, in §5.3, we
observed that ifthe two dodecahedra behaved as independent objects, then the
colouring properties (c), (d), and (e) would immediately follow, which forces
us into an insoluble vertex-colouring problem (as is shown explicitly in
Appendix B (p. 300)). Thus what Quintessential Trinkets have managed to do,
using quantum entanglement, is something that would be impossible if our two
dodecahedra had to be things that could be treated as independent objects
once they had left the Quintessential Trinkets factory. Quantum entanglement
is not just an awkwardness, telling us that we cannot always ignore the
probabilistic effects of the outside environment in a physical situation. When
its effects can be appropriately isolated, it is something very mathematically
precise, often with a clear-cut geometrical organization.
   There is no description in terms of entities which can be considered as
separate from one another, that can explain these expectations of the
quantum-mechanical formalism. There can be no 'Bertlmann's socks' type of
explanation for quantum-entangled phenomena, in general. Now, the rules of
standard quantum-mechanical evolution--our procedure U-lead us to
conclude that objects must remain 'entangled' in this strange way, no matter
300                 Structure of the quantum world: Appendix B

how distant from each other they may be. It is only with R that entanglements
can be severed. But do we believe that R is a 'real' process? If not, then these
entanglements must persist for ever, even if hidden from view by the excessive
complication of the actual world.
    Would this mean that everthing in the universe must be considered to be
entangled with everything else? As was remarked earlier (§5 . 17), quantum
entanglement is an effect that is quite unlike anything in classical physics, in
which effects tend to fall off with distance so that we do not need to know what
is going on in the Andromeda galaxy in order to explain the behaviour of
things in a laboratory on the earth. Quantum entanglement seems indeed to be
some kind of'spooky action at a distance', as was so distasteful to Einstein. Yet
it is an 'action' of an extremely subtle kind, which cannot be used for the actual
sending of messages.
    Despite their falling short of providing direct communication, the potential
distant ('spooky') effects of quantum entanglement cannot be ignored. So long
as these entanglements persist, one cannot, strictly speaking, consider any
object in the universe as something on its own. In my own opinion, this
situation in physical theory is far from satisfactory. There is no real
explanation on the basis of standard theory of why, in practice, entanglements
can be ignored. Why is it not necessary to consider that the universe is just one
incredibly complicated quantum-entangled mess that bears no relationship to
the classical-like world that we actually observe? In practice, it is the continual
use ofthe procedure R that cuts the entanglements free, as is the case when my
colleague and I make our measurements on the entangled atoms at the centres
of our dodecahedra. The question arises: is this R-action a real physical
process, so that the quantum entanglements are, in some sense, actually cut?
Or is it all to be explained as just an illusion of some kind?
    I shall try to address these puzzling matters in the next chapter. In my
opinion, these questions are central to the search for a role for non­
computability in physical action.


          Appendix B : The non-colourability of the
                                dodecahedron
Recall the problem that was set in §5.3: to show that there is no way to colour
all the vertices of a dodecahedron BLACK or WHITE so that no two next-to­
adjacent vertices can be both WHITE and no six vertices adjacent to a pair of
opposite vertices can be all BLACK. The symmetry of the dodecahedron will
be an immense help to us in eliminating possibilities.
   Let us label the vertices as in Fig. 5.29. Here, A, B, C, D, E are the vertices of
a pentagonal face, described cyclically, and F, G, H, I, J, are vertices adjacent
to them, taken in the same order. As in §5.18, A*, . . . , J* are the respective
antipodal vertices to these. We first note that because of the second property,
                    Structure of the quantum world: Appendix C                    301

there must be at least one WHITE vertex somewhere, which we can assume is
the vertex A.
   Suppose, for the moment, that the WHITE vertex A has, as one of its
immediate neighbours, another WHITE vertex-which we can take to be B
(see Fig. 5.29). Now the ten vertices that surround these two, namely C, D, E,
J, H * , F, I * , G, J * , H, must all be BLACK, because they are each next to
adjacent either to A or to B. Next, we examine the six vertices that are adjacent
to either one of the antipodal pair H, H * . There must be a WHITE one among
these six, so either F* or C * (or both) must be WHITE. Doing the same for the
antipodal pair J, J * , we conclude that either G * or E* (or both) must be white.
But this is impossible because G * and E * are both next to adjacent to both of
F * and C * . This rules out the possibility that the WHITE vertex A can have a
WHITE immediate neighbour-indeed, by symmetry, it rules out the
possibility of any pair of adjacent WHITE vertices.
   Thus, the WHITE vertex A must be surrounded by BLACK vertices B, C,
D, E, J, H * , F, I *, G, because each of these is either adjacent or next to adjacent
to A. Now, examine the six vertices that are adjacent to one of the antipodal
pair A, A * . We conclude that one of B * , E * , F * must be WHITE, and by
symmetry it does not matter which-so take the WHITE one to be F * . We
note that E * and G * are next to adjacent to F * , so they must both be black,
and so also must H be BLACK because it is adjacent to F * , and by the
previous argument we have also ruled out adjacent WHITE vertices.
However, this colouring is impossible because the antipodal vertices J, J * now
have nothing but BLACK vertices adjacent to them. This concludes the
argument, showing the classical impossibility of magic dodecahedra!


    Appendix C : Orthogonality between general spin
                                      states
The Majorana description of general spin states is not very familiar to
physicists; yet, it provides a useful and geometrically illuminating picture. I
shall give here a brief account of the basic formulae and of some of their
geometrical implications. This will provide, in particular, the needed
orthogonality relations underlying the geometry of the magic dodecahedra, as
was required for §5.18. My descriptions will differ appreciably from those
given originally by Majorana (1932), and follow more closely those of Penrose
(1994a) and Zimba and Penrose (1993).
   The idea is to consider the unordered set of n points on the Riemann sphere
as the n roots of a complex polynomial of degree n, and (essentially) to use the
coefficients of this polynomial as coordinates of the (n + 1 )-dimensional
Hilbert space of spin states for a (massive) particle of spin tn. Taking basis
states to be, as in §5. 10, the various possible results of a spin measurement in
the vertical direction, we represent these as the various monomials (together

includes the possibility of the Majorana point given by x = oo , (the south pole),
which occurs when the degree of the polynomial P(x) falls short of n, by an
amount given by the multiplicity of this point.
  A rotation of the sphere is achieved by means of a transformation according
to which a replacement


is first made (where A.l + .u.U = 1 ), and then the denominators are cleared by
multiplying the whole expression by (jix + l)" . Thus, the polynomials
corresponding to the results of (say Stern-Gerlach) measurements of spin in
an arbitrary direction can be obtained, giving expressions of the form


The points given by .u/A. and - l!.U are antipodal on the Riemann sphere, and
they correspond to the direction of the spin measurement and to its opposite.

detailed verifications are best appreciated in the 2-spinor formalism. The
reader is referred to Penrose and Rindler (1984), particularly p. 162, also
§4.15. The general state for spin !-n is described in terms of a symmetric
n-valent spinor, and the Majorana description follows from its canonical
decomposition as a symmetrized product of spin-vectors.)
  The antipodal point to any point IX on the sphere is given by - 1/a. Thus, if
we reflect all the Majorana points that are roots of the polynomial


in the centre of the sphere, we obtain the roots of the polynomial
        a*(x) = an - an _ 1 x + an _ 2 x 2 - . . . - ( - 1 )"a 1 x " - 1 + ( - 1 )"a0x " .

then their scalar product will be



This expression is invariant under rotations of the sphere, as may be directly
verified using the above formulae.
  Let us apply this scalar-product expression to the particular case when
b(x) = a*(x), so that we are concerned with two states one of whose Majorana
descriptions consists precisely of the antipodal points of the other. Their scalar
product is (up to a sign)
             1                   2'.                                  1

It will be seen from this that if n is odd then all the terms cancel, so we have the
following theorem. (The state with Majorana description P, Q, . . . , S is
denoted by I PQ . . . S). The antipodal point to X is denoted by X*.)
C.l     If n is odd, the state I PQR . . . T) is orthogonal to IP*Q* R * . . .T*).
  Two further properties that can be read off from the general expression for
the scalar product are the following.
C.2 The state IPPP . . . P) is orthogonal to each state I P * AB . . . D).
C.3 The state I QPP . . . P) is orthogonal to IABC . . . E) whenever the
stereographic projection, from P * , of the point Q* is the centroid of the
stereographic projections from P* of A, B, C, . . , D.             .

equal point masses situated at the points. Stereographic projection was
described in §5. 1 0, Fig.5. 19.) To prove C.3, rotate the sphere until P * is at the
south pole. Then the state IQPP . . . P) is represented by the polynomial
x " - 1 (x - x ), where x defines the point Q on the Riemann sphere. Forming the
scalar product with the state represented by the polynomial (x - ex 1 ) (x - ex 2 )

ex" , we find that this vanishes when
                         1 + n - 1 x (ex 1 + ex 2 + ex 3 + . . . + exn) = O,
i.e. when - 1fi. is equal to (ex 1 + ex 2 + ex 3 + . . . + exn )/n, which is the centroid, in
the complex plane, of the points given by ex 1 , ex 2 , ex 3 , , ex" . This establishes
                                                                       •   •   •



C.3. To prove C.2, we take P, instead, to be at the south pole. Then the state
IPPP . . . P) is represented by the constant 1 , considered as a polynomial of
degree n. The corresponding scalar product now vanishes when


i.e. when at least one of ex 1 , ex 2 , ex 3 , , ex" vanishes-the point 0 of the complex

plane representing the north pole P * . This establishes C.2.
   The result C.2 enables us to interpret the Majorana points in physical terms.
It has the implication that these points define the directions in which a
(Stem-Gerlach-type) spin measurement provides a zero probability of
yielding the result that the spin is entirely in the direction opposite to that
measured (cf. ENM p. 273). It also contains, as a special case, the result that
for spin ! (n = 1 ), orthogonal states are precisely those whose Majorana points
are antipodal. The result C.3 enables us to deduce the general geometrical
interpretation of orthogonality in the case of spin 1 (n = 2). A notable
particular case occurs when the two states are represented as two pairs of
antipodal points whose joins are perpendicular lines through the centre of the
sphere. In the case of spin i (n = 3), C.3 provides (with C . 1 ) all that we shall
need for §5. 1 8 . (A geometrical interpretation of orthogonality in the general
case will be given elsewhere.)
   The particular case of C.3 that is needed for §5.1 8 occurs when P and Q are
adjacent vertices of a cube inscribed in the Riemann sphere, so that PQ and
Q * P* are opposite edges ofthis cube. The lengths PQ* and QP* are j2 times
those of PQ and P*Q*. It follows from C.3, by simple geometry, that the states
IP * PP) and IO * QQ) are orthogonal.

     and were followed a few years later by the much more definitive results of
     Aspect, Grangier, and Roger (1982) (cf. also Aspect and Grangier 1 986).
4.   There is another type of 'classical' explanation possible for the particular EPR
     effects that have been observed, so far, by Aspect and others. This suggested
     explanation-retarded collapse-is due to Euan Squires (1992a), and it takes
     advantage of the fact that there may be a significant time delay in the actual
     effecting of a measurement by the detectors at the two separated locations. This
     suggestion has to be taken in the context of some theory-necessarily an
     unconventional one, such as those that we shall encounter in §6.9 or
      §6. 12-which makes some definite prediction as to a likely time at which each
     of the two quantum measurements would objectively take place. Owing to
     random influences controlling these two times, it would be considered likely
     that one of the detectors would effect its measurement significantly earlier than
     the other one-so much earlier, in fact, that (in the experiments that have been
     so far performed) there would have been ample time for a signal, travelling
     from the earlier detector at light speed, to inform the later detector what the
     result of the earlier detection had been.
         On this view, whenever a quantum measurement takes place, it is
     accompanied by a 'wave of information' travelling at the speed of light,
     outwards from the measurement event. This type of thing is perfectly in line
     with the classical relativity theory (see §4.4), but it would disagree with the
     expectations of quantum theory over long-enough distances. In particular, the
     'magic dodecahedra' of §5.3 could not be explained in terms of retarded
     collapse. Of course, no such 'experiment' has yet been performed, and one
     might take the view that the expectations of quantum theory would be violated
     in such circumstances. A more serious objection, however, is that retarded
     collapse would encounter severe difficulties with other types of quantum
     measurement, and would lead to a violation of all the standard conservation
     laws. For example, when a decaying radio-active atom emits a charged
     particle-say an rx-particle---it would be possible for two widely enough
     separated detectots to receive the same rx-particle, simultaneously violating each
     of the conservation laws for energy, electric charge, and baryon-number! (For
     wide enough separation, the 'wave of information' coming from the first
     detector would not have enough time to warn the second detector to be unable
     to observe this same rx-particle! ) However, these conservation laws would still
     hold 'on average', and I am not aware of any actual observation contradicting
     the idea. For a recent assessment of the status of retarded collapse, see Home
     (1994).

     been aware of an EPR formulation of their own example.

7.   The most efficient 'half-silvered mirror' would not actually be silvered at all,
     but would be a thin piece of transparent material of just the right thickness in
     relation to the wavelength of the light. It would achieve its effect by a
306                        Structure of the quantum world

    complicated combination of repeated internal reflections and transmissions, so
    that the final transmitted and reflected beams are equal in intensity. It follows
    from the 'unitary' nature of the resulting transformation between the finally
    transmitted and reflected beams that there must indeed be a resulting phase
    shift of a quarter of a wavelength, giving the factor of 'i' as required. See Klein
    and Furtak (1986) for a more complete discussion.

 9. There is some arbitrariness about the choice of phase-factor that I have
    adopted here for the reflected state. It depends partly upon what kind of mirror
    is used. In fact, unlike the 'half-silvered' mirror referred to in endnote 7 (which
    was probably not silvered at all) we can consider these two mirrors to be
    actually fully silvered. The factor of 'i' that I have adopted here is a kind of
    compromise, achieving a superficial agreement with the factor obtained in the
    case of reflection from the 'half-silvered' mirrors. In fact it does not really
    matter what factor is adopted for reflection from the fully silvered mirrors, so
    long as we are consistent in what we do for both the mirrors in question.

            Quantum theory and reality




                        6. 1 Is R a real process?
In the previous chapter, we have been trying to come to terms with the
puzzling Z-mysteries of quantum theory. Although not all of these phenomena
have been experimentally tested-such as quantum entanglement over
distances of several light years 1 -there is already enough experimental
support for effects of this kind to tell us that Z-mysteries are indeed things that
we must take seriously as true aspects of the behaviour of the constituents of
the world in which we live.
   The actions of our physical world at the quantum level are indeed very
counter-intuitive, and in many ways quite different from the 'classical'
behaviour that seems to operate at the more familiar level of our experiences.
The quantum behaviour of our world certainly includes entanglement effects
over many metres, at least so long as they involve only quantum-level objects,
such as electrons, photons, atoms, or molecules. The contrast between this
strange quantum behaviour of 'small' things, even over large separations, and
the more familiar classical behaviour oflarger things, underlies the problem of
the X-mysteries of quantum theory. Can it really be the case that there are two
kinds of physical law, one of which operates at one level of phenomena and the
other of which operates at another?
   Such an idea is quite at variance with what we have come to expect in
physics. Indeed, one of the profound achievements of the seventeenth-century
dynamics of Galilei-Newton was that the motions of heavenly bodies could
now be understood to obey precisely the same laws as operate here on earth.
From the time ofthe ancient Greeks and before, it had been believed that there
must be one set of laws for the heavens and a completely separate set holding
here on earth. Galileo and Newton taught us to see how the laws could be the
same at all scales-a fundamental insight that was essential for the progress of
science. Yet (as has been stressed by Professor Ian Percival, of the University
of London), with quantum theory we seem to have reverted to a scheme like
that of the ancient Greeks, with one body of laws operating at the classical
level and another very different body oflaws at the quantum level. It is my own
308                         Quantum theory and reality

opinion-an opinion shared by a sizeable minority of physicists-that this
state of physical understanding cannot be other than a stop-gap, and we may
well anticipate that the finding of appropriate quantum/classical laws that
operate uniformly at all scales might herald a scientific advance of a magnitude
comparable with that initiated by Galileo and Newton.
   The reader may, however, quite rightly question whether it is indeed the
case that our standard understanding of quantum theory presents us with a
quantum-level picture which does not also explain classical phenomena.
Many would disclaim my contention that it does not, asserting that physical
systems that are in some sense large or complicated, and acting entirely
according to quantum-level laws, would behave just like classical objects, at
least to a very high degree of accuracy. We shall try, first, to see whether this
assertion-the assertion that the apparently 'classical' behaviour oflarge-scale
objects follows from the quantum behaviour of their tiny constituents-is
believable. And if we find that it is not, we shall try to see where to turn, in
order to arrive at a coherent viewpoint that might make sense at all levels. I
should warn the reader, however, that the entire question is fraught with much
controversy. There are many different viewpoints, and it would be foolish for
me to try to give a comprehensive summary of them all, let alone to argue in
detail against all of those that I find implausible or untenable. I ask the reader's
indulgence for the fact that the viewpoints that I present will be given very
much from my own perspective. It is inevitable that I shall not be entirely fair
to those whose viewpoints are too foreign to my own, and I apologize in
advance for the injustices that I shall undoubtedly commit.
   There is a fundamental difficulty with trying to find a clear scale at which the
quantum level of activity, characterized by the persistence of quantum
superpositions of different alternatives, actually gives way-by the action of
R-to the classical, at which such superpositions do not seem to occur. This
results from an inherent 'slipperiness' in the procedure R, from the
observational point of view, which prevents us from pinpointing any clear
level at which it 'happens'-one reason that many physicists do not regard it as
a real phenomenon at all. It seems to make no difference to experiments where
we choose to apply R, so long as we do so at a level higher than that at which
quantum interference effects have been observed, yet no higher than the level
at which we can directly perceive that classical alternatives do take place,
rather than being in complex linear superpositions (though, as we shall be
seeing shortly, even at this end some would maintain that the superpositions
persist).
   How can we decide at what level R actually takes place-if indeed it really
takes place physically at all? It is hard to see how to answer such a question by
physical experiment. If R is a real physical process, there is a vast range of
possible levels at which it might occur, between tiny levels where quantum
interference effects have been observed, and the much larger level at which
classical behaviour is actually perceived. Moreover, these differences in 'level'
                            Quantum theory and reality                         309

do not seem to refer to physical size, since we have seen above (in §5.4) that the
effects of quantum entanglement can stretch over distances of many metres.
We shall be seeing later that energy differences provide a better measure of this
scale oflevel than does physical dimension. Be this as it may-at the large end
of things, the place where 'the buck stops' is provided by our conscious
perceptions. This is an awkward matter from the point of view of physical
theory, because we do not really know what physical processes in the brain are
associated with perception. Nevertheless, the physical nature of these
processes would seem to provide the large-end limit for any proposed theory of
a real R-process. This still allows for a huge range between the two extremes,
and there is considerable scope for numerous different attitudes as to what
really happens when R is brought in.
   One of the main issues concerns the 'reality' of the quantum formalism-or
even of the quantum-level world itself. In this connection, I cannot resist
quoting a remark that was made to me by Professor Bob Wald, of the
University of Chicago, at a dinner-party some years ago:

      If you really believe in quantum mechanics, then you can't take it
      seriously.

It seems to me that this expresses something profound about quantum theory
and about people's attitudes to it. Those who are most vehement about
accepting the theory as being in no way in need of modification tend not to
think that it represents the actual behaviour of a 'real' quantum-level world.
Niels Bohr, who was a leading figure in the development and interpretation of
quantum theory, was one of the most extreme in this respect. He seems to have
regarded the state vector as no more than a convenience, useful only for
calculating probabilities for the results of 'measurements' that might be
performed on a system. The state vector itself was not to be thought of as
providing an objective description of any kind of quantum-level reality, but as
representing merely 'our knowledge' of the system. Indeed, it was to be
regarded as doubtful that the very concept of 'reality' applied meaningfully at
the quantum level. Bohr was certainly someone who 'really believed in
quantum mechanics', and his view of the state vector seemed, indeed, to be
that it should not be 'taken seriously' as the description of a physical reality at
the quantum level.
   The broad alternative to this quantum viewpoint is to believe that the state
vector does provide an accurate mathematical description of a real quantum­
level world-a world that evolves to an extraordinary degree of precision,
though perhaps not with a total accuracy, according to the mathematical rules
that the equations of the theory provide. Here, it seems to me, there are two
main routes that may be followed. There are those who regard the procedure
U to be all there is in the evolution of the quantum state. The procedure R,
accordingly, is taken to be some kind of illusion, convenience, or approxima-
3 10                        Quantum theory and reality

tion, and is not to be taken as part of the actual evolution of the reality that is
indeed to be described by the quantum state. Such people, it appears, must be
driven in the direction of what is known as the many-worlds or Everett
interpretation(s ). 2 I shall explain something of this kind of viewpoint in a
moment. Those, on the other hand, who 'take seriously' the quantum
formalism most completely are those who believe that both U and R represent
(to a considerable accuracy) actual physical behaviour of a physically real,
state-vector-described, quantum/classical-level world. But if one is to take the
quantum formalism that seriously, then it becomes hard really to believe that
the theory can be completely accurate at all levels. For the action of R, as the
procedure stands, is at variance with many ofthe properties ofU, in particular
its linearity. In this sense, one would not 'really believe in quantum mechanics'.
In the sections which follow, I shall discuss these matters more fully.


                    6.2 Many-worlds-type viewpoints
Let us first try to see how far we can get following the other 'realistic' route, the
one that ultimately leads to a kind of viewpoint often referred to as the 'many­
worlds' interpretation. Here one tries to accept the state vector, evolving
entirely under the action of U, as providing the true reality. This forces one to
accept that classical-level objects like golf balls or people must also be subject
to the laws of quantum linear superposition. It could be suggested that this
might cause no serious difficulty so long as such superposed states become an
extremely rare occurrence at the classical level. The problem, however, lies
with the linearity of U. Under the action of U, the weighting factors for
superposed states remain the same no matter how much material gets
involved. The procedure U, by itself, does not enable superpositions to
become 'unsuperposed' merely because a system gets large or complicated.
Such superpositions would in no way tend to 'disappear' for classical-level
objects, and one is faced with the implication that classical objects, also, ought
frequently to appear in manifestly superposed states. The question that must
then be faced is: why do such large-scale superpositions of alternatives not
impinge upon our awareness of the classical-level world?
   Let us try to understand how proponents of a many-worlds type of view
would explain this. Consider a situation like that discussed in §5. 1 7, where a
photon detector, described by a state 1'1'), encounters a superposed photon
state lex > + IP > . where lex > would activate the detector but I P > would leave it
undisturbed. (Perhaps a photon, emitted by some source, has impinged upon
a half-silvered mirror, and lex > and IP> might represent the transmitted and
reflected parts of the photon state.) We are now not questioning the
applicability of the state-vector concept to a classical-level object like an entire
detector, since on this view, state vectors are taken to be accurate
representations of reality at all levels. Thus, 1 '1'> can describe the entire
                            Quantum theory and reality                           311

detector, and not perhaps just some quantum-level initial parts as in §5. 17.
Recall that, as in §5 . 1 7, after the time of encountering the photon, the detector
and photon state evolves from the product j'P)(ja) + IP>) to the entangled
state


This entire entangled state is now taken to represent the reality of the situation.
One does not say that either the detector has received and absorbed the
photon (state j'Pv ) ) or else the detector has not received it and the photon
remains free (state I'�'N > IP') ), but one maintains that both alternatives co-exist
in superposition, as part of a total reality in which all such superpositions are
preserved. We can carry this further, and imagine that a human experimenter
examines the detector to see whether or not it has registered the reception of
the photon. The human being, before examining the detector, should also have
a quantum state, say 1� >. so we have a combined 'product' state at that stage,
namely


Then, after examining the state, the human observer either perceives the
detector having received and absorbed the photon (state l�v ) ), or perceives
the detector not having received the photon (an orthogonal state I�N) ). If we
make the assumption that the observer is not interacting with the detector
after observing it, we have the following form of state vector describing the
situation:


   There are now two different (orthogonal) observer states, both involved in
the entire state of the system. According to one of these, the observer is in the
state of having perceived that the detector registered receiving the photon; and
this is accompanied by the detector state in which the photon has indeed been
received. According to the other, the observer is in the state of having
perceived that the detector has not registered receiving the photon; and this is
accompanied by the detector state with the photon not received by it, and the
photon moving off freely. In the many-worlds-type viewpoints, then, there
would be different instances (copies) of the observer's 'self', co-existing within
the total state and having different perceptions of the world around. The
actual state of the world that accompanies each copy of the observer would be
consistent with the perceptions of that copy.
   We can generalize this to the more 'realistic' physical situations in which
there would be huge numbers of different quantum alternatives continually
occurring throughout the universe's history-rather than just the two of this
example. Thus, according to this many-worlds type of viewpoint, the total
state of the universe would indeed comprise many different 'worlds' and there
312                          Quantum theory and reality

would be many different instances of any human observer. Each instance
would perceive a world that is consistent with that observer's own perceptions,
and it is argued that this is all that is needed for a satisfactory theory. The
procedure R would, according to this view, be an illusion, apparently arising as
a consequence of how a macroscopic observer would perceive in a quantum­
entangled world.
   For my own part, I have to say that I find this viewpoint very unsatisfactory.
It is not so much the extraordinary lack of economy that this picture
provides-though this is indeed a worrying feature, to say the least. The more
serious objection is that the viewpoint does not really provide a solution ofthe
'measurement problem' that it was set up to solve.
   This quantum measurement problem is to understand how the procedure R
can arise-or effectively arise-as a property of large-scale behaviour in D­
evolving quantum sytems. The problem is not solved merely by indicating a
possible way in which an R-like behaviour might conceivably be accommo­
dated. One must have a theory that provides some understanding of the
circumstances under which (the illusion of?) R comes about. Moreover, one
must have an explanation of the remarkable precision that is involved in R. It
appears that people often think of the precision of quantum theory as lying in
its dynamical equations, namely U. But R itself is also very precise in its
prediction of probabilities, and unless it can be understood how these come
about, one does not have a satisfactory theory.
   In the absence of further ingredients, the many-worlds viewpoint does not
really properly come to terms with either of these. Without a theory of how a
'perceiving being' would divide the world up into orthogonal alternatives, we
have no reason to expect that such a being could not be aware of linear
superpositions of golf balls or elephants in totally different positions. (We
should note that the mere orthogonality of the 'perceiver states', such as with
l�v) and I �N> above, in no way serves to single these states out. Compare the
case of i L +- ) and I L -+ ), as opposed to I L j) and I L!>, in the EPR discussion of
 §5.17. In each case the pair of states is orthgonal, as are l�v) and I�N), but
there is nothing to choose one pair in favour of the other.) Moreover, the
many-worlds viewpoint provides no explanation for the extremely accurate
wonderful rule whereby the squared moduli of the complex-number weighting
factors miraculously become relative probabilities. 3 (Compare also the
discussions given in §6.6 and §6.7.)


                       6.3 Not taking II/I> seriously
There are many versions of the viewpoint according to which the state vector
II/I) is not regarded as providing an actual picture of a quantum-level physical
reality. Instead, I I/I > would be taken to serve only as a calculational device,
useful merely for calculating probabilities, or as an expression of the
                            Quantum theory and reality                          313

experimenter's 'state of knowledge' concerning a physical system. Sometimes,
II/I) is taken to represent not the state of an individual physical system but an
ensemble of possible similar physical systems. Often it is argued that a
complicatedly entangled state vector II/I) will behave 'for all practical
purposes' (or FAPP, as John Bell succinctly put it4 ) in the same way as such an
ensemble of physical systems-and that this is all that physicists need to know
concerning the measurement problem. Sometimes, it is even argued that II/I)
cannot describe a quantum-level reality since it makes no sense at all to talk of
a 'reality' for our world at that level, reality consisting only of the results of
'measurements'.
    To such as myself (and Einstein and SchrOdinger too-so I am in good
company), it makes no sense to use the term 'reality' just for objects that we can
perceive, such as (certain types of) measuring devices, denying that the term
can apply at some deeper underlying level. Undoubtedly the world is strange
and unfamiliar at the quantum level, but it is not 'unreal'. How, indeed, can
real objects be constructed from unreal constituents? Moreover, the
mathematical laws that govern the quantum world are remarkably precise-­
as precise as the more familiar equations that control the behaviour of
macroscopic objects-despite the fuzzy images that are conjured up by such
descriptions as 'quantum fluctuations' and 'uncertainty principle'.
    Yet, if we accept that there must be a reality of some kind that holds at the
quantum level, we may still have doubts that this reality can be accurately
described by a state vector ll/1). There are various arguments that people raise
as objections to the 'reality' of ll/1). In the first place, II/I > seems to need to
undergo this mysterious non-local discontinuous �umping', from time to time,
that I have been denoting by the letter R. This does not seem to be the way in
which a physically acceptable description of the world should behave,
especially since we already have the marvellously accurate continuous
Schrodinger equation U, which is already supposed to be controlling the way
in which II/I> evolves (most of the time). Yet, as we have seen, U, by itself, leads
us into the difficulties and puzzlements of the many-worlds-type viewpoints,
and if we require a picture that closely resembles the actual universe that we
seem to perceive around us, then something of the nature of R is indeed
needed.
    Another objection to the reality of II/I) that is sometimes put forward is that
the kind of alternation U, R, U, R, U, R, . . . that is in effect used in quantum
theory is not a description that is symmetrical in time (because it is R that
determines the starting point of each U-action, not the finishing point), and
that there is another completely equivalent description in which the U-time­
evolutions are reversed (cf. ENM, pp. 355, 356; Figs 8 . 1 , 8.2). Why should we
take one of these as providing 'reality' and not the other? There are even
viewpoints according to which both the forward- and backward-evolved state
vectors are to be taken seriously as co-existing parts of the description of
physical reality (de Beauregard and Werbos 1989; Aharonov and Vaidman
3 14                        Quantum theory and reality

1990). I believe that there is likely to be something of profound significance
underlying these considerations, but for the moment I do not wish to dwell on
the matter. I shall touch on these, and some related, issues in §7. 1 2.
   One of the most frequent objections to taking I t/!) seriously as a description
of reality is that it is not directly 'measureable'-in the sense that if one is
presented with a totally unknown state, then there is no experimental way of
determining what the state vector (up to a proportionality factor) actually is.
Take the case of the spin of an atom of spin !, for example. Recall (§5. 10, Fig.
5.19) that each possible state of its spin would be characterized by a particular
direction in ordinary space. But if we have no idea what that direction is, then
we have no way of determining it. All we can do is to settle on some direction
and ask the question: is its spin in that direction (YES) or is it in the opposite
direction (NO)? Whatever the spin state is taken initially to be, its Hil�rt­
space direction gets projected to either the YES space or the NO space, with
certain probabilities. And at that point we have lost most ofthe information as
to what the spin state 'actually' was. All that we can obtain, from a spin­
direction measurement, for an atom of spin ! is one bit of information (i.e. the
answer to one yes/no question), whereas the possible states of spin direction
form a continuum, which would need an infinite number of bits of information
in order to determine it precisely.
   All this is true, yet it remains hard to take the opposite position either: that
the state vector I t/!) is somehow physically 'unreal', perhaps encapsulating
merely the sum total of 'our knowledge' about a physical system. This, I find
very bard to accept, particularly since there appears to be something very
subjective about such a role of 'knowledge'. Whose knowledge, after all, is
being referred to here? Certainly not mine. I have very little actual knowledge
of the individual state vectors that are relevant to the detailed behaviour of all
the objects that surround me. Yet they carry on with their precisely organized
actions, totally oblivious to whatever might be 'known' about the state vector,
or to whomever might know it. Do different experimenters, with different
knowledge about a physical system, use different state vectors to describe that
system? Not in any significant way; they might only do so if tbese differences
were about features of the experiment that would be inessential to the
outcome.
   One of the most powerful reasons for rejecting such a subjective viewpoint
concerning the reality of 5 l t/J> comes from the fact that whatever I t/!> might be,
 there is always-in principle, at least-a primitive measurement (cf. §5. 1 3 )
whose YES space consists of the Hilbert-space ray determined b y lt/1). The
point is that the physical state I t/!> (determined by the ray of complex multiples
of I t/!)) is uniquely determined by the fact that the outcome YES, for this state,
is certain. No other physical state has this property. For any other state, there
would merely be some probability, short of certainty, that the outcome will be
YES, and an outcome of NO might occur. Thus, although there is no
measurement which will tell us what I t/!) actually is, the physical state I t/!) is
                              Quantum theory and reality                             315

uniquely determined by what it asserts must be the result of a measurement
that might be performed on it. This is a matter of counterfactuals again (§5.2,
§5.3), but we have seen how important counterfactual issues actually are to the
expectations of quantum theory.
     To put the point a little more forcefully, imagine that a quantum system has
been set up in a known state, say 14> ), and it is computed that after a time t the
state will have evolved, under the action of U, into another state lt/1). For
example, 1 4> ) might represent the state 'spin up' (1 4>) = l i> ) of an atom of spin !,
and we can suppose that it has been put in that state by the action of some
previous measurement. Let us assume that our atom has a magnetic moment
aligned with its spin (i.e. it is a little magnet pointing to the spin direction).
When the atom is placed in a magnetic field, the spin direction will precess in a
well-defined way, that can be accurately computed as the action of U, to give
some new state, say lt/1 > = 1 -+ ) , after a time t. Is this computed state to be taken
seriously as part of physical reality? It is hard to see how this can be denied.
For lt/1 > has to be prepared for the possibility that we might choose to measure
it with the primitive measurement referred to above, namely that whose YES
space consists precisely of the multiples of lt/1). Here, this is the spin
measurement in the direction -+ . The system has to know to give the answer
YES, with certainty for that measurement, whereas no spin state of the atom
other than lt/1 > = 1 -+ ) could guarantee this.
     In practice, there would be many kinds of physical situation, different from
spin determinations, in which such a primitive measurement would be totally
impractical. Yet the standard rules of quantum theory do allow that these
measurements could be performed in principle. To deny the possibility of
measurements of this kind for certain 'too complicated' types of lt/1) would be
to change the framework of quantum theory. Perhaps that framework should
be changed (and in §6. 12 I make some specific suggestions in that direction).
But it must be appreciated that at least some kind of change is necessary if
objective distinctions between different quantum states are to be denied, i.e. if
lt/1 > is not to be taken to be, in some clear physical sense, objectively real (at
least up to proportionality).
     The 'minimal' change that is often suggested, in connection with
measurement theory, is the introduction of what are referred to as
superselection rules6 which indeed effectively deny the possibility of making
certain types of primitive measurements on a system. I do not wish to discuss
these in detail here, since in my opinion, no such suggestions have been
developed to the stage in which a coherent general viewpoint has emerged with
regard to the measurement problem. The only point that I wish to stress here is
that even a minimal change of this nature is still a change-and this brings out
the main point that some kind of change is necessary.
     Finally, I should perhaps mention that there are various other approaches
to quantum theory which, though not at variance with the predictions of the
conventional theory, provide 'pictures of reality' that differ in various respects
    316                          Quantum theory and reality

    from that in which the state vector II/I) is, by itself, 'taken seriously' as
    representing that reality. Among these is the pilot wave theory of Prince Louis
    de Broglie (1956) and David Bohm (1952}--a non-local theory according to
    which there is something equivalent to a wavefunction II/I> and a system of
    classical-like particles, both of which are taken to be 'real' in the theory. (See
    also Bohm and Hiley 1994.) There are also viewpoints which involve entire
    'histories' of possible behaviour (stimulated by Richard Feynman's approach
    to quantum theory (1948)) and according to which the view of'physical reality'
    differs somewhat from that provided by an ordinary state vector II/I). Recent
    proponents of a scheme of this general kind, but which also takes into account
    the possibility of what are, in effect, repeated partial measurements (in
·   accordance with an analysis due to Aharonov et al. (1964)), are Griffiths
    (1984), Omnes (1992), Gell-Mann and Hartle (1993). It would be inappro­
    priate for me to indulge in a discussion of these various alternatives here
    (though it should be mentioned that the density-matrix formalism introduced
    in the next section plays an important part in some of them-also in the
    operator approach of Haag (1992)). I should at least say that, although these
    procedures contain many points of considerable interest and some stimulating
    originality, I am as yet quite unconvinced that the measurement problem can
    really be resolved solely in terms of descriptions of these various kinds. Of
    course, it is certainly possible that time might prove me wrong.


                             6.4 The density matrix
    Many physicists would take the line that they are pragmatic people, and are
    not interested in questions of the 'reality' of II/I). All that one needs from I I/I),
    they would say, is to be able to calculate appropriate probabilities as to future
    physical behaviour. Often, a state that has previously been taken to represent
    a physical situation �volves into something extremely complicated, where
    entanglements with the detailed environment become so involved that there is
    no possibility in practice of ever seeing the quantum interference effects that
    distinguish that state from many others like it. Such 'pragmatic' physicists
    would no doubt claim that there would be no sense in maintaining that the
    particular state vector that has resulted from this evolution has any more
    'reality' than others that are in practice indistinguishable from it. Indeed, they
    might claim, one may just as well use some probability mixture of state vectors
    to describe 'reality' as use any particular state vector. The contention is that if
    the application of U to some state vector representing the initial state of a
    system yields something that, for all practical purposes (Bell's F APP), is
    indistinguishable from such a probability mixture of state vectors, then the
    probability mixture, rather than the U-evolved state vector, is good enough
    for a description of the world.
       It is frequently argued that-at least FAPP-the R-procedure can be
                               Quantum theory and reality                                 317

understood in these terms. Two sections hence, I shall try to address this
important question. I shall ask whether it is indeed true that the (apparent)
U/R paradox can be resolved by such means alone. But let us first try to be a
little more explicit about the procedures that are adopted in the standard
FAPP type of approach to an explanation of the (apparent?) R-process.
   The key to these procedures is a mathematical object referred to as a density
matrix, The density matrix is an important concept in quantum theory, and it
is this quantity, rather than the state vector, that tends to underlie most
standard mathematical descriptions of the measurement process. It will play a
central role, also, in my own less conventional approach, especially with
regard to its relationship to the standard FAPP procedures. For this reason, it
will unfortunately be necessary to go a little more into the mathematical
formalism of quantum theory than we had needed to before. I hope that the
uninitiated reader will not be daunted by this. Even if a full understanding does
not come through, I believe that it will be helpful to the reader to skim over the
mathematical arguments wherever they appear, and no doubt something of
their flavour will come through. This will be of considerable value for the
understanding of some of the later arguments and of the subtleties involved in
appreciating why we actually do need an improved theory of quantum
mechanics !
   We can think of a density matrix as representing a probability mixture of a
number of possible alternative state vectors, rather than simply a single state
vector. By a 'probability mixture' we merely mean that there is some
uncertainty about what the actual state of the system may happen to be, where
each possible alternative state vector is assigned a probability. These are just
real-number probabilities in the ordinary classical sense. But with a density
matrix there is a (deliberate) confusion, in this description, between these
classical probabilities, occurring in this probability-weighted mixture and the
quantum-mechanical probabilities that would result from the R-procedure.
The idea is that one cannot operationally distinguish between the two, so a
mathematical description-the density matrix-which does not distinguish
between them is operationally appropriate.
    What is this mathematical description? I do not want to go into a great deal
of detail about it here, but an indication of the basic concepts will be helpful.
This density-matrix idea is in fact a very elegant one. * First, in place of each
individual state lt/1 > we use an object written as
                                           lt/1 > < ifJ I.
         *It was put forward in 1932 by the remarkable Hungarian/American mathemati­
      cian John von Neumann who, moreover, was the main person originally
      responsible for the theory underlying electronic computer development, following
      the seminal work of Alan Turing. The game theory referred to in end-note 9 of
      Chapter 3 (see p. 1 55) was also von Neumann's brain-child, but more importantly
      for us here, it was he who first clearly distinguished the two quantum procedures
      that I have labelled 'U' and R
                                  '   '.

What does this mean? The precise mathematical definition is not important
for us here, but this expression represents a kind of 'product' (a form of the
tensor product referred to in §5.15) between the state vector It/!> and its
'complex conjugate', written ( t/JI. We take It/! > to be a Kormaliz ed state vector
{(t/Jit/1) = 1 ), and then the expression l t/l ) ( t/11 is uniquely determined by the
physical state that the vector It/!) represents (being independent of the phase­
factor freedom lt/J)t--+ei9lt/J > , discussed in §5.10). In Dirac's terminology, the
original It/! > is called a 'ket'-vector and < t/11 is its corresponding 'bra'-vector.
Together, a bra-vector < t/11 and a ket-vector 1 4>) can also be combined to form
their scalar product ('bracket'):
                                               < t/114> >
a notation that the reader will recognize from §5.12. This scalar product is just
an ordinary complex number, whereas the tensor product It/!> < 4>1 that occurs
with a density matrix yields a more complicated mathematical 'thing'-an
element of a certain vector space.
   There is a particular mathematical operation called 'taking the trace' that
enables us to pass from this 'thing' to an ordinary complex number. For a
single expression like It/!) < ¢ 1 , this amounts just to reversing the order of the
terms to produce the scalar product:
                                trace (It/!) < ¢1) = ( 4>1 tjJ),
whereas for a sum of terms, 'trace' acts linearly; for example,


   I shall not go into the details of all the mathematical properties of objects
like < t/J I and It/!) < ¢1, but several points are worth noting. In the first place, the
product It/!) < 4>1 satisfies just the same algebraic laws as are listed on p. 288 for
the product lt/1 >1 4> > (except for the last one, which is not relevant here):
                        (z I t/!)) < 4>1 = z(lt/1 )( 4>1 ) = It/!) (z( 4>1),
                         (It/! > + l x > ) < 4>1 = lt/1><4>1 + l x > < 4>1 .
                         I t/! > ( < 4>1 + < x i) = It/! >< 4>1 + I t/! > < x i.
We should also note that the bra-vector z(t/11 i s the complex conjugate of the
ket-vector zlt/1> (z being the ordinary complex conjugate of the complex
number z , cf. p. 264), and < t/11 + < x i is the complex conjugate of It/!> + l x > .
  Suppose that we wish to describe the density matrix that represents some
probability mixture of normalized states, say ioc), IP >. with respective
probabilities a, b. The appropriate density matrix will, in this case, be
                                 Quantum theory and reality                           319

For three normalized states lac), IP > , I Y ), with respective probabilities a, b, c,
we have
                          D = a loc)(ocl + b IP><PI + c I Y )( y l,
and so on. From the fact that the probabilities for all the alternatives must add
up to unity, the following important property may be deduced, which holds for
any density matrix:
                                         trace (D) = 1 .
  How can we use a density matrix to calculate the probabilities arising in
some measurement? Let us consider first the case of a primitive measurement.
We ask the system whether it is in the physical state l t/1 > (YES) or something
orthogonal to l t/1 > (NO). The measurement itself is represented by a
mathematical object (called a projector) very similar to a density matrix:
                                           E= l t/l ) ( t/1 1.
The probability p of obtaining YES is then
                                        p = trace (DE),
where the product DE is itself the density-matrix-like 'thing' that would be
obtained using the rules of algebra in an almost ordinary way-but being
careful about the orderings of 'multiplications'. For example, for the above
two-term sum D = a loc ><ocl + b iP><PI, we have
                     DE = (a loc)(ocl + b IP >< PI)I t/1 > ( t/1 1
                        = a lac> (oc l t/1 > ( t/1 1 + b IP > < P l t/1 > ( t/1 1
                        = (a(oc l t/l>) loc> < t/1 1 + (b(p l t/1 > ) IP > < t/1 1.
The terms (ocl t/1 > and < Pi t/1 > can be 'commuted' with other expressions since
they are simply numbers, but we must be careful about the orderings of'things'
like lac > and ( t/1 1. We deduce (noting that zz= lzl 2 , cf. p. 268)
                 trace (DE) = (a (oc l t/1 >) ( t/1 lac > + (b(P l t/1 > ) (t/IIP>
                             = al (oc l t/1 > 1 2 + bi < P l t/1 > 1 2
                                                                     •




Recall (cf. §5.13, p. 285) that l <ocl t/1 > 1 2 and I< Pi t/1 > 1 2 are the quantum prob­
abilities for the respective outcomes lac > and IP > . whereas a and b provide the
classical contributions to the total probability. Thus, the quantum probabili­
ties and classical probabilities are all mixed together in the final expression.
   For the more general yes/no measurement, the discussion is basically the
same, except that in place of the 'E' defined above we use a more general
projector such as
320                         Quantum theory and reality

                             E= lift><iftl + 14>><4>1 + · · · + l x > < x l .
where lift>, 14> ) , . . . , l x > are mutually orthogonal normalized states spanning
the space of YES states in the Hilbert space. We have the general property
                                              E2 = E,
which characterizes a projector. The probability of YES, for the measurement
defined by the projector E on the system with density matrix D , is trace (DE),
exactly as before.
   We take note of the important fact that the required probability can be
calculated if we simply know the density matrix and the projector describing
the measurement. We do not need to know the particular way in which the
density matrix has been put together in terms of particular states. The total
probability comes out automatically as the appropriate combination of
classical and quantum probabilities, without our having to worry about how
much of the resulting probability comes from each part.
   Let us examine more closely this curious way in which classical and
quantum probabilities are interwoven within the density matrix. Suppose, for
example, we have a particle of spin !. and that we are completely uncertain as
to whether the (normalized) spin state happens to be li> or I ! > · Thus, taking
the respective probabilities to be ! and j, the density matrix becomes
                                 D = !lt><tl + !l!><!l ·
Now it turns out (by a simple calculation) that precisely the same density
matrix D would arise with an equal probability mixture j, !, of any other
orthogonal possibilities, say the (normalized) states 1 -+ ) and 1 +- ) (where
1 - > = < I t > + l !»/�2 and 1 - > = < It> - I!»I.J2 > :
                             D = !l -+ >< - I + !I - >< - I ·
Suppose that we elect to measure the spin of the particle in the upward
direction, so the relevant projector is
                                 E= lt> <tl.
Then we find, for the probability of YES according to the first description,
                      trace (DE) = !l<tlt>l 2 + !l<!lt>l 2
                                 = ! x 1 2 + ! x 02
                                 = !.
where we are using <tit> = 1 and <!It> = 0 (the states being normalized and
orthogonal); and according to the second,
                   trace (DE) = !I< -+ lt>l 2 + !I< +- lt>l 2
                              = ! X (l/J2) 2 + ! X (1/.J2) 2
                                  = ! + ! = !.
                              Quantum theory and reality                             321

where now the right/left states I -+), I +- ) are neither orthogonal nor parallel to
the measured state l i > , and in fact I< -+l i > l = I< +- l i> l = 1/.J2.
   Although the probabilities come out the same (as they must, because the
density matrix is the same), the physical interpretation of these two
descriptions is quite different. We are accepting that the physical 'reality' of
any situation is to be described by some definite state vector, but there is a
classical uncertainty as to what this actual state vector might happen to be. In
the first of our two descriptions above, the state is either l i > or I ! > , but one
does not know which. In the second, it is either I -+ ) or 1 +- ) and one does not
know which. In the first description, when we perform a measurement to ask if
the state is l i > , it is a simple matter of classical probabilities: there is indeed a
straightforward probability oft that this state is I j ) , and that is all there is to it.
In the second description, where we ask the same question, it is the probability
mixture of I -+ ) and I +- ) that the measurement encounters, and each
contributes a classical contribution t times a quantum-mechanical contribu­
tion t to the total of i+ i = t. We see that the density matrix cleverly contrives
to give the correct probability no matter how this probability is considered to
be built up out of classical and quantum-mechanical parts.
   The above example is somewhat special in that the density matrix possesses
what are called 'degenerate eigenvalues' (the fact that, here, the two classical
probability values t. ! are equal), which is what allows one to have more than
one description in terms of probability mixtures of orthogonal alternatives.
However, this is not an essential point for our present discussion. (I mention it
mainly to put the experts at ease.) One can always allow the alternative states
in a probability mixture to involve many more states than just a set of mutually
orthogonal alternatives. For example, in the above situation, we could have
complicated probability mixtures of many different possible spin directions. It
turns out that for any density matrix whatsoever-not merely ones with
degenerate eigenvalues-there are large numbers of completely different ways
of representing the same density matrix as a probability mixture of alternative
states.



                6 . 5 Density matrices for EPR pairs
Now let us examine a type of situation for which a density-matrix description
is particularly appropriate-yet which points out an almost paradoxical
aspect of its interpretation. This is in its relation to EPR effects and quantum
entanglement. Let us consider the physical situation discussed in §5. 1 7, where
a particle of spin 0 (in state I n)) splits into two particles of spin ! that travel to
the left and right to a great distance apart, providing the expression for their
combined (entangled) states of spin:
322                            Quantum theory and reality

Suppose that the spin of the right-hand particle is soon to be examined by
some observer's measuring apparatus, but that the left-hand one has travelled
away to such a great distance that the observer has no access to it. How would
the observer describe the right-hand particle's state of spin?
  It would be very appropriate for him * to use the density matrix
                            D = !IRf> (Rfl + !IR!> (R!I ·
For he might imagine that another observer-some colleague a long way
off-had chosen to measure the spin of the left-hand particle in an up/down
direction. He has no way of telling which result his imaginary colleague might
have obtained for that spin measurement. But he does know that if his
colleague had obtained the result IL f), then his own particle's state would
have to be IR!>, whereas had his colleague obtained IL!>, then his own
particle's state must be IRf). He also knows (from what the standard rules of
quantum theory tell him to expect for the probabilities in this situation) that it
is equally likely that his imaginary colleague would have obtained IL f ) as
IL! > . Thus, he concludes that the state of his own particle is an equal
probability mixture (i.e. respective probabilities j, j) for the two alternatives
IRf > , IR! > , so his density matrix must indeed be D , as just given above.
   He might, however, imagine that his colleagues has just measured the left­
hand particle in a left/right direction instead. Exactly the same reasoning (now
using the alternative description In> = IL .- >IR -+ ) - IL -+ >IR .-. ), cf. p. 293)
would lead him to conclude that his own particle's spin state is an equal
probability mixture of right and left, which provides him with the density
matrix
                        D = !IR -+ > (R -+ 1 + !IR .- > (R .-. 1 .
A s has been said before, this is indeed precisely the same density matrix as we
just had, but its interpretation as a probability mixture of alternative states is
quite different! It does not matter which interpretation the observer adopts.
His density matrix provides him with all the information that is available for
the calculations of probabilities for the results of spin measurements on the
right-hand particle alone. Moreover, since his colleague is merely imagined,
our observer need not consider that any spin measurement has been
performed on the left-hand particle at all. The same density matrix D tells him
all that he can know about the spin state of the right-hand particle prior to his
actually measuring that particle. Indeed, we could suppose that the 'actual
state' ofthe right-hand particle is more correctly given by the density matiix D
than any particular state vector.
   Considerations of this general kind sometimes lead people to think of
density matrices as providing a more appropriate description of quantum
'reality' in certain circumstances than do state vectors. However, this would

        * See Notes to the reader, p. xvi.
                           Quantum theory and reality                         323

not provide us with a comprehensive viewpoint in situations like the one just
considered. For there is nothing in principle to prevent our observer's
imaginary colleague becoming a real one, and the two observers eventually
communicating their results to one another. The correlations between the
measurements of one observer and the other cannot be explained in terms of
separate density matrices for the left- and right-hand particles separately. For
this we need the entire entangled state provided by the expression for the
actual state vector In>. as given above.
   For example, if both observers choose to measure their particles' spins in the
up/down direction, then they must necessarily obtain opposite answers for the
results of their measurements. Individual density matrices for the two particles
will not provide this information. Even more seriously, Bell's theorem (§5.4)
shows there is no classical-type local ('Bertlmann's socks') way to model the
entangled state ofthe combined particle pair, before measurement. (See ENM,
Chapter 6, endnote 14, p. 301 , for a simple demonstration of this fact­
essentially one due to Stapp (1979; cf. also Stapp 1993)---in the case where one
of the observers chooses to measure his particle's spin either up/down or
rightjleft, whereas the other chooses either of the two directions at 45° to these
two. If we replace the two spin ! particles by two of spin i, then the magic
dodecahedra of §5.3 show this kind of thing even more convincingly, since
now no probabilities are needed.)
   This shows that the density-matrix description could be adequate to
describe the 'reality' of this situation only if there is some reason in principle
why measurements on·the two parts of the system cannot be performed and
compared. There seems no reason, in normal situations, why this should be
the case. In abnormal situations-such as one considered by Stephen
Hawking (1982) in which one particle of an EPR pair might be captured inside
a black hole-there might be a more serious case for a density-matrix
description at the fundamental level (as Hawking indeed argues). But this
would, in itself, constitute a change in the very framework of quantum theory.
Without such a change, the essential role of the density matrix is FAPP, rather
than fundamental-though its role is an important one nevertheless.


                 6.6 A F APP explanation of R?
Let us now see how density matrices indeed play their part in the
standard-FAPP-approach to explaining how it is that the R-process
'seems' to come about. The idea is that a quantum system and a measuring
apparatus, together with the environment that they both inhabit-all assumed
to be evolving together according to U-will behave as though R has taken
place whenever the effects of the measurement become inextricably entangled
with this environment.
   The quantum system is taken to be initially isolated from its environment,
324                         Quantum theory and reality

but upon being 'measured' it triggers larger-scale effects in the measuring
apparatus that soon involve entanglements with considerable and ever­
increasing parts of that environment. At this stage, the picture becomes in
many ways similar to the EPR situation that was discussed in the preceding
section. The quantum system, together with the measuring apparatus that it
has just triggered, plays a role rather like that of the right-hand particle,
whereas the disturbed environment plays a role like that of the left-hand one. A
physicist proposing to examine the measuring apparatus would play a similar
role to the observer, in the discussion above, who examines the right-hand
particle. That observer had no access to any measurements that might be
performed on the left-hand one; similarly, our physicist has no access to the
detailed way in which the environment might be disturbed by the measuring
apparatus. The environment would consist of enormous numbers of randomly
moving particles, and we may take it that the detailed information contained
in the precise way in which the particles in the environment have been
disturbed would, in practice, be irretrievably lost to the physicist. This is
similar to the fact that any information concerning the left-hand particle's
spin, in the example above, is inaccessible to the right-hand observer. As with
the right-hand particle, the state of the measuring apparatus is appropriately
described by a density matrix rather than a pure quantum state; accordingly it
is treated as a probability mixture of states, rather than a pure state on its own.
This probability mixture provides the probability-weighted alternatives that
the procedure R would have given us-at least FAPP-so the standard
argument goes.
    Let us consider an example. Suppose that a photon is emitted by some
source, in the direction of a detector. Between source and detector is a partially
silvered mirror, and after encountering the mirror, the photon's state is a
superposition
                                    w J ot) + z J p),
where the transmitted state J ot) would activate the detector (YES) but the
reflected one I P> would leave it undisturbed (NO). I am here assuming that all
states are normalized, so that, according to the R-procedure, we would obtain:
              probability of YES = J w J 2 ; probability of NO = J z J 2 •
For a half-silvered mirror (as in the initial example considered in §5.7, where
our j ot) and I P> would be the states J B) and i J C), respectively) these two
probabilities are each !. and we have J w l = J z l = 1/,J2.
  The detector initially has state J'¥), which evolves to J 'Pv) (YES) upon
absorbing the photon (in state J ot)) and which evolves to J 'PN ) (NO) ifit fails to
absorb the photon (in state J P> ). If the environment could be ignored, then the
state at that stage would have the form
                                w J 'Pv) + z J 'PN > I P>
                              Quantum theory and reality                              325

(all states assumed normalized); but let us assume that the detector, being a
macroscopic object, very quickly becomes involved in interactions with its
surrounding environment-and we can assume that the fleeing photon
(originally in state IP>) is absorbed by the laboratory wall to become part of
the environment also. As before, according to whether or not the detector
receives the photon, it settles down into the detector state l "'�'v > or I"'�'N),
respectively, but in doing so it would disturb the environment in a different
way in each case. We can assign the environment state l ct>v > to accompany
l "'�'v ), and lct>N) to accompany I"'�'N> (again assumed normalized, but not
necessarily orthogonal) and we can express the full state in the entangled form


   So far, the physicist is not involved, but he is about to examine the detector
to see whether it has registered YES or NO. How would he view the quantum
state of the detector just before he examines it? As with the observer measuring
the spin of the right-hand particle in the previous discussion, it would be
appropriate for him to use a density matrix. We may suppose that no
measurement is actually performed on the environment in order to ascertain
whether its state is l ct>v > or lct>N), just as with the left-hand particle in the EPR
pair described above. Accordingly, a density matrix indeed provides an
appropriate quantum description of the detector.
   What is this density matrix? The standard type of argument 7 (based on
some particular way of modelling this environment-and also on some
incompletely justified assumptions, such as the unimportance of EPR-type
correlations) leads to the conclusion that this density matrix should rapidly
and very closely approach the form


where


This density matrix can be interpreted as representing a probability mixture of
the detector registering YES, with probability lwl 2 , and the detector registering
NO, with probability lzl 2 • This is just exactly what the R-process would have
told us that the physicist will find as the result of his experiment-or is it?
   We must be a little careful about coming to this conclusion. The density
matrix D would indeed allow our physicist to calculate the probabilities that
he needs, if he is allowed to assume that the alternatives open to him are simply
that the state of the detector is either I"'�' v > or I"'�' N > · But this assumption is by
no means a consequence of our discussion. Recall from the previous section
that density matrices have many alternative interpretations as probability
mixtures of states. In particular, in the case of a half-silvered mirror, we obtain
a density matrix ofjust the same form as we did for the particle of spin ! above:
326                              Quantum theory and reality




This can be re-expressed as, say,
                              D = ii'Pp) ( 'Ppl + !-I'PQ > ( 'PQ l •
where I'Pp) and I'P Q) are two quite different orthogonal possible states for the
detector-states that would be quite absurd from the point of view of classical
physics, such as


The fact that the physicist considers that the state of his detector is described
by the density matrix D does not in any way explain why he always finds that
the detector is either in a YES state (given by I'Pv )) or else in a NO state (given
by I'PN ) ). For precisely the same density matrix would be given if the state were
an equal-probability-weighted combination of the classical absurdities I'Pp)
and I'PQ ) (which respectively describe the quantum linear superpositions 'YES
plus NO' and 'YES minus NO')!
    To emphasize the physical absurdity of states like I'Pp) and I'P Q ), for a
macroscopic detector, consider the case of a 'measuring apparatus' that
consists of a box with a cat in it, where the cat is killed by some device if the
detector receives a photon (in state I a > ) but not otherwise (photon in state
I P > }-a Schrodinger's cat (cf. §5. 1 and Fig. 6.3). The YES answer would be
presented in the form of 'cat dead' and the NO answer as 'cat alive'. However,
merely to know that the density matrix has the form of an equal mixture of
these two states certainly does not tell us that the cat is either dead or alive
(with equal probabilities), since it could just as well be either 'dead plus alive'
or 'dead minus alive' with equal probabilities ! The density matrix alone does
not tell us that these latter two classically absurd possibilities will never be
experienced in the actual world as we know it. As with the 'many-worlds' type
of approach to an explanation of R, we seem to be forced, again, into
considering what kind of states a conscious observer (here, our 'physicist') is
allowed to perceive. Why, indeed, is a state like 'cat dead plus cat alive' not
something that a conscious external* observer would ever become aware of?
     One might reply that the 'measurement' that our physicist is about to
perform on the detector was, after all, simply to determine whether the detecor
registers YES or NO-i.e. to ascertain, in this example, whether the cat is dead
or alive. (This is similar to the observer, in the previous section, determining
whether the spin of the right-hand particle is up or down.) For this
measuremt-nt the density matrix indeed gives the correct probabilities,

         *Of course, the matter of the eat's own consciousness would have to be
      considered also ! This aspect of things is brought into clear focus with a version of
      the Schriidinger cat paradox due to Eugene P . Wigner (1961). 'Wigner's friend'
      suffers some of the indignity of Schriidinger's cat, but is fully conscious in each of his
      superposed states !
                           Quantum theory and reality                         327

whichever way we choose to represent it. However, this is really begging the
question. We must ask why it is that merely looking at the cat indeed performs
a measurement of this kind. There is nothing simply in the D-evolution of a
quantum system that tells us that in the act of 'looking' and consequently of
perceiving a quantum system our awareness is forbidden from encountering
the combinaton 'cat dead plus cat alive'. We are back where we were before.
What is awareness? How are our brains actually constructed? Not to have to
be forced into considerations of this kind was one of the clearest reasons for
considering F APP explanations of R in the first place!
   Some might try to argue that we have been considering an unrepresentative
special case in our example here, where the two probabilities ! and ! are equal
(the case of 'degenerate eigenvalues'). Only in such situations can the density
matrix be represented in more than one way as a probability-weighted mixture
of mutually orthogonal alternatives. This is not an important restriction,
however, since orthogonality of the alternatives is not a requirement for the
interpretation of a density matrix as a probability-weighted mixture. In fact, in
a recent paper, Hughston et al. (1993) have shown that in situations like the
one considered here, where a density matrix arises because the system under
consideration is entangled with another separate system, then for whatever
way one chooses to represent that density matrix as a probability mixture of
alternative states, there is always a measurement that can be performed on
that separate system which yields this particular way of representing the
density matrix. In any case, since the ambiguity is present in the case when
probabilities are equal, then this alone tells us that the density-matrix
description is not sufficient for describing what the alternative actual states of
our detector must be.
   The upshot of all this is that merely knowing that the density matrix is some
D does not tell us that the system is a probability mixture of some particular set
of states that give rise to this particular D. There are always numerous
completely different ways of getting the same D, most of which would be
'absurd' from the common-sense point of view. Moreover, this kind of
ambiguity holds for any density matrix whatsoever.
   The standard discussions do not often progress beyond the point of trying to
show that the density matrix is 'diagonal'. This means, in effect, that it can be
expressed as a probability-weighted mixture of mutually orthogonal alterna­
tives-or, rather, that it can be so expressed, when these alternatives are the
classical alternatives that one is interested in. (Without this final proviso, all
density matrices would be diagonal !) But we have seen that the mere fact that
the density matrix can be expressed in this way does not, in itself, tell us that
detectors will not be perceived in 'absurd' quantum superpositions of YES and
NO at the same time.
   Thus, contrary to what is frequently claimed, the standard argument does
not explain how the 'illusion' of R takes place as some kind of approximate
description of D-evolution, when the environment becomes inextricably
328                         Quantum theory and reality

involved. What this argument does show is that the R-procedure can co-exist
peacefully with D-evolution, under such circumstances. We still need R as a
part of quantum theory that is separate from D-evolution (at least in the
absence of some theory that tells is what kind of states conscious beings can
perceive).
   This, in itself, is important for the general consistency of quantum theory.
But it is also important to realize that this co-existence and this consistency
has a FAPP status rather than a rigorous one. Recall, from the final discussion
in the previous section, that the density-matrix description of the right-hand
particle was adequate only in the absence of a possible comparison between
measurements that might be performed on both particles. For that, the entire
state, with its quantum, rather than merely probability-weighted super­
positions was needed. In the same way, the density-matrix description of
the detector in the present discussion is adequate only if the fine details
of the environment cannot be measured and comparison made with the results
of the experimenter's observations of the detector. R can co-exist with D only if
the fine details of the environment are immune from measurement; and the
subtle quantum interference effects, that (according to standard quantum
theory) lie hidden in the immense complication of the detailed description of
the environment, can never be observed.
   It is clear that the standard argument contains some good measure of truth;
yet it cannot in any way be the entire answer. How are we to be sure that the
effects of such interference phenomena are not to be uncovered by some future
advances in technology? We should need some new physical rule which tells us
that certain experiments that cannot at present be performed in practice can
actually never even be performed in principle. According to such a rule, there
would have to be some level of physical action at which it is deemed to be in
principle impossible to retrieve these interference effects. It would seem that
some new physical phenomenon will have to come in, and the complex­
weighted superpositions of quantum-level physics actually become classical­
level physical alternatives, rather than becoming such alternatives merely
FAPP. The FAPP viewpoint, as it stands, gives us no picture of an actual
physical reality . It cannot really be the case that F APP is other than a stop-gap
of a physical theory-though a valuable stop-gap nevertheless-and it will be
important for the proposals that I shall be putting forward in §6.12.


  6.7 Does FAPP explain the squared modulus rule?
There has been an implicit further assumption, in the preceding three sections,
which has been allowed to pass almost unnoticed. The necessity of this
assumption alone actually nullifies any suggestion that we have been able to
deduce the squared modulus rule of the R-procedure from D-evolution--even
FAPP. In the very use of a density matrix, we have, indeed, implicitly assumed
                            Quantum theory and reality                         329

that a probability-weighted mixture is appropriately described by such an
object. The very appropriateness of expressions like ioc) (oc l , which is itself a
form of 'thing times its complex conjugate', is already intimately tied up with
the assumption of the squared modulus rule. The rule for obtaining
probabilities from a density matrix correctly combines classical with quantum
probabilities only because the squared modulus rule is inbuilt in the very
notion of a density matrix.
   While it is in fact true that the process of unitary evolution (U) dovetails,
mathematically, with the notion of a density matrix and with the Hilbert-space
scalar product (ociP), it does not in any way tell us that it is probabilities that
are to be calculated by means of squared moduli. It is again a matter of mere
co-existence between R and U, rather than an explanation of R from U.
Unitary evolution says nothing whatever about the notion of probability. It is
a clear-cut additional assumption that quantum probabilities can be
calculated by this procedure, no matter how one attempts to justify the
consistency of R with U, be it by means of a many-worlds or a FAPP
approach.
   Since so much of the experimental support that quantum mechanics enjoys
arises from the very way in which the theory tells us that probabilities must be
calculated, we can ignore the R-part of quantum mechanics only at our peril. It
is something different from U, and it is not a consequence ofU, no matter how
hard and how frequently theorists have attempted to show that it must be.
Since it is not a consequence of U, it is something that we must come to terms
with as a physical process in its own right. This is not to suggest that it must be
a physical law in its own right. No doubt it is an approximation to something
else that we may not understand as yet. The discussions at the end of the
previous section strongly suggest that the use of the R-procedure in the process
of measurement is indeed an approximation.
   Let us accept that something new is required, and try to venture forth, with
due caution, into various avenues of the unknown that may be open to us.


  6.8 Is it consciousness that reduces the state vector?
Among those who take ll/1) seriously as a description of the physical world,
there are some who would argue-as an alternative to trusting U at all scales,
and thus believing in a many-worlds type of viewpoint-that something of the
nature of R actually takes place as soon as the consciousness of an observer
becomes involved. The distinguished physicist Eugene Wigner once sketched
a theory of this nature (Wigner 1961). The general idea would be that
unconscious matter-or perhaps just inanimate matter-would evolve
according to U, but as soon as a conscious entity (or 'life') becomes physically
entangled with the state, then something new comes in, and a physical process
that results in R takes over actually to reduce the state.
330                         Quantum theory and reality

    There need be no suggestion, with such a viewpoint, that somehow the
conscious entity might be able to 'influence' the particular choice that Nature
makes at this point. Such a suggestion would lead us into distinctly murky
waters and, as far as I am aware, there would be a severe conflict with observed
facts with any too simplistic suggestion that a conscious act of will coUld
influence the result of a quantum-mechanical experiment. Thus, we are not
requiring, here, that 'conscious free will' should necessarily be taking an active
role with regard to R (but cf. §7 . 1 , for some alternative viewpoints).
    No doubt some readers might expect that, since I am searching for a link
between the quantum measurement problem and the problem of conscious­
ness, I might find myself attracted by ideas of this general nature. I should
make myself clear that this is not the case. It is probable, after all, that
consciousness is a rather rare phenomenon throughout the universe. There
appears to be a good deal of it occurring in many places on the surface of the
earth, but as far as evidence has presented itself to us to this date, 8 there is no
highly developed consciousness-if, indeed, any at all-right out into depths
of the universe many light centuries away from us. It would be a very strange
picture of a 'real' physical universe in which physical objects evolve in totally
different ways depending upon whether or not they are within sight or sound
or touch of one of its conscious inhabitants.
    For example, consider the weather. The detailed patterns of weather that
happen to develop on any planet, being dependent upon chaotic physical
processes (cf. §1 .7), must be sensitive to numerous individual quantum events.
If the process R does not actually take place in the absence of consciousness,
then no particular actual weather pattern will be resolved out of the morass of
quantum-superposed alternatives. Can we really believe that the weather
patterns on some distant planet remain in complex-number superpositions of
innumerable distinct possibilities-just some total hazy mess quite distinct
from an actual weather-until some conscious being becomes aware of it, at
which point, and only at which point, the superposed weather becomes an
actual weather?
    It might be argued that from an operational point of view-from the
operational point of view of a conscious being, that is-such a superposed
'weather' would be no different from an uncertain actual weather (FAPP!).
However, this in itself is no satisfactory solution to the problem of physical
reality. We have seen that the FAPP viewpoint does not resolve these deep
issues of 'reality', but remains a stop-gap that allows the U- and R-procedures
 of present-day quantum mechanics to co-exist-at least until our technology
 takes us to the point where a more precise and coherent viewpoint is necessary.
    Thus, I propose to look elsewhere for a resolution of the problems of
 quantum mechanics. Though it may well be the case that the problem of mind
 is ultimately related to that of quantum measurement--or to the U/R paradox
 of quantum mechanics-it is not, according to my own belief, consciousness in
 itself (or consciousness in the form that we are familiar with) that. can resolve
                            Quantum theory and reality                          331

the internal physical issues of quantum theory. I believe that the problem of
quantum measurement should be faced and solved well before we can expect
to make any real headway with the issue of consciousness in terms of physical
action-and that the measurement problem must be solved in entirely physical
terms. Once we are in possession of a satisfactory solution, then we may be in a
better position to move towards some kind of answer to the question of
consciousness. It is my view that solving the quantum measurement problem
is a prerequisite for an understanding of mind and not at all that they are the
same problem. The problem of mind is a much more difficult problem than the
measurement problem!



                   6.9 Taking lt/1) really seriously
So far, the viewpoints that would claim to take the quantum description of the
world seriously fall short of taking it really seriously, as I see it. The quantum
formalism is perhaps too strange for it to be at all easy to take what it actually
says seriously, and most physicists would shy away from taking too strong a
line on this. For in addition to having a state vector II/I > that evolves according
to U, so long as the system remains at the quantum level, we have the
disturbing discontinuous and probabilistic action ofR, which seems to have to
be brought in to effect discontinuous 'j umps' in II/I> as soon as quantum-level
effects become magnified enough to influence things at the classical level.
Thus, if we are to take II/I) as providing a picture of reality, then we must take
these jumps as physically real occurrences too, no matter how uncomfortable
we may feel about this. However, if one is this serious about the reality of the
quantum-state-vector description, then one must also be prepared to
introduce some (preferably very subtle) change into the actual rules of
quantum theory. For the operation of U is, strictly speaking, incompatible
with R, and some delicate 'paper-work' will be needed to cover the cracks
between the descriptions of the quantum and classical levels of behaviour.
   In fact, over the years, there have been several unconventional attempts to
build coherent theories along such lines. The Hungarian school, headed by
Karolyhazy of Budapest, has, since about 1966, put forward a viewpoint in
which gravitational effects would lead to some kind of R-procedure as a real
physical phenomenon (cf. also Komar 1969). Following a somewhat different
line, Phillip Pearle of Hamilton College, Clinton, NY, USA, has been
suggesting, since about 1976, a non-gravitational theory in which R takes
place as a real physical phenomenon. More recently, in 1986, an interesting
new approach was put forward by Giancarlo Ghirardi, Alberto Rimini, and
Tullio Weber and, following some very positive encouragement by John Bell,
there have been numerous further suggestions and improvements by others. 9
   Before presenting my own preferences on the subject in the next sections,

which borrow much from the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) scheme, it will
be helpful first to outline their proposal here. The basic idea is to accept the
reality of It/! > and, for the most part, the accuracy of the standard U­
procedures. Then the wavefunction of a single, initially localized, free particle
would, according to the Schrodinger equation, tend to spread outwards in all
directions into space as time progresses (see Fig. 6 . 1 ). (Recall that the
wavefunction of a particle describes the complex weighting factors for the
different possible locations that the particle might have. We may think of the
graphs of Fig. 6.1 as schematically describing the real part of this weighting
factor.) Thus, as time passes, the particle becomes less and less localized. The
new feature of the GRW scheme is to assume that there is a very small
probability that, suddenly, this wavefunction gets itself multiplied by a
strongly peaked function-known as a Gaussian function-with a certain
spread, defined by some parameter a . This is illustrated in Fig. 6.2. The
wavefunction of the particle instantly becomes very localized, ready to begin
its outward spread again. The probability that the peak of this Gaussian
function finds itself to be in one place or another would be proportional to the
squared modulus of the value of the wavefunction at that location. In this way,
the scheme achieves consistency with the standard 'squared modulus rule' of
quantum theory.
   How often is this procedure taken to be applied? It would amount to
roughly once every hundred million (108) years ! Call this time period T. Then,

      Fig. 6.3. Schrodinger's cat. The quantum state involves a linear
      superposition of a reflected and transmitted photon. The transmitted
      component triggers a device that kills a cat, so according to U-evolution
      the cat exists in a superposition of life and death. According to the GRW
      scheme, this is resolved because particles in the cat will almost
      instantaneously suffer hits, the first of which would localize the eat's state
                                as either dead or alive.




suitable kind effecting a large-scale change-a measurement in fact. For
example, we could have a single photon emitted by a source and
reflected/transmitted at a half-silvered mirror (as in §5.7). Let us say that the
transmitted part of the photon's wavefunction triggers a detector coupled to a
device that kills the cat, but the reflected part escapes, and leaves the cat
unharmed. See Fig. 6.3. Just as with the discussion of detectors as given above
( §6.6), there would result an entangled state with one part involving a dead cat
and the other one involving a live cat and an escaping photon. Both
possibilities would be taken together in the state vector, so long as no
reduction process (R) is allowed to take place. This, the mystery of
'measurement', is indeed the central X-mystery of quantum theory .
    In the GRW scheme, however, an object as large as a cat, which would
involve some 1 0 27 nuclear particles, would almost instantaneously have one of
its particles 'hit' by a Gaussian function (as in Fig. 6.2), and since this particle's
state would be entangled with the other particles in the cat, the reduction of
that particle would 'drag' the others with it, causing the entire cat to find itself
in the state of either life or death. In this way, the X-mystery of Schrodinger's
cat-and of the measurement problem in general-is resolved.
    This is an ingenious scheme, but it suffers from being very ad hoc. There is
nothing in other parts of physics to indicate such a thing, and the suggested
values for T and u are simply chosen in order to get 'reasonable' results . (Di6si
( 1 989) has suggested a scheme resembling that of GRW where, in effect, the
parameters T and u would be fixed in terms of Newton's gravitational constant
 G. There is a very close link between his ideas and those I shall describe in a
moment. ) Another somewhat more serious difficulty with schemes of this kind
is that there is a (small) violation of the principle of conservation ofenergy. This
will have considerable importance for us in §6. 1 2 .

 6. 1 0 Gravitationally induced state-vector reduction ?
There are strong reasons* for suspecting that the modification of quantum
theory that will be needed, if some form of R is to be made into a real physical
process, must involve the effects of gravity in a serious way. Some of these
reasons have to do with the fact that the very framework of standard quantum
theory fits most uncomfortably with the curved-space notions that Einstein's
theory of gravity demands. Even such concepts as energy and time-basic to
the very procedures of quantum theory--cannot, in a completely general
gravitational context, be precisely defined consistently with the normal
requirements of standard quantum theory. Recall, also, the light-cone 'tilting'
effect ( §4.4) that is unique to the physical phenomenon of gravity. One might
expect, accordingly, that some modification of the basic principles of quantum
theory might arise as a feature of its (eventual) appropriate union with
Einstein's general relativity.
   Yet most physicists seem reluctant to accept the possibility that it might be
the quantum theory that requires modification for such a union to be
successful. Instead, they argue, Einstein's theory itself should be modified.
They may point, quite correctly, to the fact that classical general relativity has
its own problems, since it leads to space-time singularities, such as are
encountered in black holes and the big bang, where curvatures mount to
infinity and the very notions of space and time cease to have validity (see
ENM, Chapter 7). I do not myself doubt that general relativity must itself be
modified when it is appropriately unified with quantum theory. And this will
indeed be important for the understanding of what actually takes place in
those regions that we presently describe as 'singularities'. But it does not
absolve quantum theory from a need for change. We saw in §4. 5 that general
relativity is an extraordinarily accurate theory-no less accurate than is
quantum theory itself. Most of the physical insights that underlie Einstein's
theory will surely survive, not less than will most of those of quantum theory,
when the appropriate union that moulds these two great theories together is
finally found�
   Many who might agree with this, however, would still argue that the
relevant scales in which any form of quantum gravity might become relevant
would be totally inappropriate"for the quantum measurement problem. They
would point to the length scale that characterizes quantum gravity, called the
Planck scale, of 10 - 3 3 cm, which is some 20 orders of magnitude smaller even
than a nuclear particle; and they would severely question how the physics at
such tiny distances could have anything to do with the measurement problem
which, after all, is concerned with phenomena that (at least) border upon the

         *In ENM, Chapters 7 and 8, I presented such reasons in some detail, and there is
      no need to repeat the arguments here. Suffice it to say that these reasons still
      stand-although the specific criterion of §6.12 differs from that given in ENM (on
      pp. 367-71).

      Fig. 6.4. Instead of having a cat, the measurement could consist of the
      simple movement of a spherical lump. How big or massive must the lump
                  be, or how far must it move, for R to take place?



macroscopic domain. However, there is a misconception here as to how
quantum gravity ideas might be applied. For 1 0 - 3 3 em is indeed relevant, but
not in the way that first comes to mind.
   Let us consider a type of situation, somewhat like that of Schrodinger's cat,
in which one strives to produce a state in which a pair of macroscopically
distinguishable alternatives are linearly superposed . For example, in Fig. 6.4
such a situation is depicted, where a photon impinges upon a half-silvered
mirror, the photon state becoming a linear superposition of a transmitted and
reflected part. The transmitted part of the photon's wavefunction activates (or
would activate) a device which moves a macroscopic spherical lump (rather
than a cat) from one spatial location to another. So long as Schrodinger
evolution U holds good, the 'location' of the lump involves a quantum
superposition of its being in the original position with its being in the displaced
position. lf R were to come into effect as a real physical process, then the lump
would 'jump' either to one position or to the other-and this would constitute
an actual 'measurement'. The idea here is that, as with the GRW theory, this is
indeed an entirely objective physical process, and it would occur whenever the
mass of the lump is large enough or the distance it moves, far enough. (In
particular, it would have nothing to do with whether or pot a conscious being
might happen to have actually 'perceived' the movement, or otherwise, of the
lump.) I am imagining that the device that detects the photon and moves the
lump is itself small enough that it can be treated entirely quantum­
mechanically, and it is only the lump that registers the measurement. For
example, in an extreme case, we might simply imagine that the lump is poised
sufficiently unstably that the mere impact of the photon would be enough to
cause it to move away significantly.
   Applying the standard U-procedures of quantum mechanics, we find that
the photon's state, after it has encountered the mirror, would consist of two
parts in two very different locations. One of these parts then becomes
entangled with the device and finally with the lump, so we have a quantum
                                Quantum theory and reality                                    337

state which involves a linear superposition of two quite different positions for
the lump. Now the lump will have its gravitational field, which must also be
involved in this superposition. Thus, the state involves a superposition of two
different gravitational fields. According to Einstein's theory, this implies that
we have two different space-time geometries superposed ! The question is : is
there a point at which the two geometries become sufficiently different from
each other that the rules of quantum mechanics must change, and rather than
forcing the different geometries into superposition, Nature chooses between
one or the other of them and actually effects some kind of reduction procedure
resembling R?
   The point is that we really have no conception of how to consider linear
superpositions of states when the states themselves involve different space­
time geometries. A fundamental difficulty with 'standard theory' is that when
the geometries become significantly different from each other, we have no
absolute means of identifying a point in one geometry with any particular
point in the other.....:....the two geometries are strictly separate spaces-so the
very idea that one could form a superposition of the matter states within these
two separate spaces becomes profoundly obscure.
   Now, we should ask when are two geometries to be considered as actually
'significantly different' from one another? It is here, in effect, that the Planck
scale of 1 0 - 3 3 em comes in. The argument would roughly be that the scale of
the difference between these geometries has to be, in an appropriate sense,
something like 1 0 - 3 3 em or more for reduction to take place. We might, for
example, attempt to imagine (Fig. 6.5) that these two geometries are trying to
be forced into coincidence, but when the measure of the difference becomes too
large, on this kind of scale, reduction R takes place-so, rather than the
superposition involved in U being maintained, Nature must choose one
geometry or the other.
   What kind of scale of mass or of distance moved would such a tiny change in
geometry correspond to? In fact, owing to the smallness of gravitational
effects, this turns out to be quite large, and not at all unreasonable as a
demarcation line between the quantum and classical levels. In order to get a
feeling for such matters, it will be useful to say something about absolute (or
Planckian) units.



                              6.11 Absolute units
The idea (due originally* to Max Planck (1906) and followed up particularly
by John A. Wheeler ( 1 975)) is to use the three most fundamental constants of

         *A very similar idea was put forward 25 years earlier by the Irish physicist
      George Johnstone Stoney (1881), where the charge on the electron rather than
      Planck's constant (the latter being unknown at the time) was taken as the basic unit.

      Fig. 6.5. What is the relevance of the Planck scale of w- 33 em to quantum
      state reduction? Rough idea: when there is sufficient mass movement
      between the two states under superposition such that the two resulting
              space-times differ by something of the order of 10-33 em.


Nature, the speed of light c, Planck's constant (divided by 2n) h, and Newton's
constant of gravitation G, as units for converting all physical measures into
pure (dimensionless) numbers. What this amounts to is choosing units of
length, mass, and time so that these three constants all take the value unity :

                                 c=1 , h=1 , G=l.

The Planck scale 10-33 em, which in ordinary units one would express as
( Gh/c 3) 1'2, now simply takes the value 1 , so it is the absolute unit of length. The
corresponding absolute unit of time, which is the time that light would take to
traverse a Planck distance, is the Planck time (= (Gh/c 5) 1'2), about 1 0-43
seconds. There is also an absolute unit of mass, referred to as the Planck mass
(= (hc/G)1'2), which is about 2 x 10-5 grams, a very large mass from the point
of view of normal quantum phenomena, but fairly small in ordinary terms­
something like the mass of a flea.
   Clearly these are not very practical units, except possibly for the Planck
mass, but they are very useful when we consider effects that might have
relevance in relation to quantum gravity. Let us see how some of the more
relevant physical quantities appear, very roughly, in absolute units :

                           6.12 The new criterion
I shall now give a new criterion 1 1 for gravitationally induced state-vector
reduction that differs significantly from that suggested in ENM , but which is
close to some recent ideas due to Di6si and others. The motivations for a link
between gravity and the R-procedure, as given in ENM , still hold good, but
the suggestion that I am now making has some additional theoretical support
from other directions. Moreover, it is free of some of the conceptual problems
involved in the earlier definition, and it is much easier to use. The proposal in
ENM was for a criterion, according to which two states might be judged (with
regard to their respective gravitational fields-i .e. their respective space­
times) to be too different from one another for them to be able to co-exist in
quantum linear superposition. Accordingly, R would have to take place at
that stage. The present idea is a little different. We do not seek an absolute
measure of gravitational difference between states which determines when the
states differ too much from each other for superposition to be possible.
Instead, we regard superposed widely differing states as unstable-rather like
an unstable uranium nucleus, for example-and we ask that there be a rate of
state-vector reduction determined by such a difference measure. The greater
the difference, the faster would be the rate at which reduction takes place.
   For clarity, I shall first apply the new criterion in the particular situation
that was described in §6. 10 above, but it can also be easily generalized to cover
many other examples. Specifically, we consider the energy that it would take,
in the situation above, to displace one instance of the lump away from the
other, taking just gravitational effects into account. Thus, we imagine that we
have two lumps (masses), initially in coincidence and interpenetrating one
another (Fig. 6.6), and we then imagine moving one instance of the lump away
from the other, slowly, reducing the degree of interpenetration as we go, until
the two reach the state of separation that occurs in the superposed state under
consideration. Taking the reciprocal of the gravitational energy that this
operation would cost us, measured in absolute units,* we get the approximate
time, also in absolute units, that it would take before state reduction occurs,

         *We may prefer to express this reduction time in more usual units than the
      absolute units adopted here. In fact, the expression for the reduction time is simply
      h/E, where E is the gravitational separation energy referred to above, with no other
      absolute constant appearing other than h. The fact that the speed of light c does not
      feature suggests that a 'Newtonian' model theory of this nature would be worth
      investigating, as has been done by Christian (1994).

      Fig. 6.6. To compute the reduction time h/E, imagine moving one instance
      of the lump away from the other and compute the energy E that this would
             cost, taking into account only their gravitational attraction.


whereupon the lump's superposed state would spontaneously jump into one
localized state or the other.
  If we take the lump to be spherical, with mass m and radius a, we obtain a
quantity of the general order of m 2 ja for this energy. In fact the actual value of
the energy depends upon how far the lump is moved away, but this distance is
not very significant provided that the two instances of the lump do not (much)
overlap when they reach their final displacement. The additional energy that
would be required in moving away from the contact position, even all the way
out to infinity, is of the same order (t times as much) as that involved in
moving from coincidence to the contact position . Thus, as far as orders of
magnitude are concerned, one can ignore the contribution due to the
displacement of the lumps away from each other after separation, provided
that they actually (essentially) separate. The reduction time, according to this
scheme, is of the order of




measured in absolute units, or, very roughly,
                                        1

where p is the density of the lump. This gives about 10 186/aS. for something of
ordinary density (say, a water droplet).
   It is reassuring that this provides very 'reasonable' answers in certain simple
situations. For example, in the case of a nucleon (neutron or proton), where we
take a to be its 'strong interaction size' 10- 1 3 em, which in absolute units is
nearly 1 0 20 , and we take m to be about 10 19 , we get a reduction time of nearly
10 58 , which is over ten million years. It is reassuring that this time is large,

      Fig. 6.7. Suppose that instead of moving a lump, the transmitted part of
           the photon's state is simply absorbed in a body of fluid matter.



because quantum interference effects have been directly observed for
individual neutrons. 1 2 Had we obtained a very short reduction time, this
would have led to conflict with such observations .
   If we consider something more 'macroscopic', say a minute speck of water of
radius 10-5 em, we get a reduction time measured in hours ; if the speck were of
radius 10-4 em (a micron), the reduction time, according to this scheme,
would be about a twentieth of a second; if of radius 10- 3 em, then less than a
millionth of a second. In general, when we consider an object in a
superposition of two spatially displaced states, we simply ask for the energy
that it would take to effect this displacement, considering only the
gravitational interaction between the two . The reciprocal of this energy
measures a kind of 'half-life' for the superposed state. The larger this energy,
the shorter would be the time that the superposed state could persist.
   In an actual experimental situation, it would be very hard to keep the
quantum-superposed lumps from disturbing-and becoming entangled
with-the material in the surrounding environment, in which case we would
have to consider the gravitational effects involved in this environment also.
This would be relevant even if the disturbance did not result in significant
macroscopic-scale movements of mass in the environment. Even the tiny
displacements of individual particles could well be important-though
normally at a somewhat larger total scale of mass than with a macroscopic
'lump' movement.
   In order to clarify the effect that a disturbance of this kind might have in the
present scheme, let us replace the lump-moving device, in the above idealized
experimental situation, by a lump of fluid matter that simply absorbs the
photon, if it is transmitted through the mirror (Fig. 6. 7), so now the lump itself
is playing the role of the 'environment'. Instead of having to consider a linear
superposition between two states that are macroscopically distinct from each
other, by virtue of one instance of the lump having been moved bodily with
respect to the other, we are now just concerned with the difference between two
configurations of atomic positions, where one configuration of particles is
displaced randomly from the other. For a lump of ordinary fluid material of
radius a, we may now expect to find a reduction time that is perhaps something
of the order of 10 130 /a 3 (depending, to some extent, on what assumptions are
342                         Quantum theory and reality

made) rather than the 10 186/a 5 that was relevant for the collective movement
of the lump. This suggests that somewhat larger lumps would be needed in
order to effect reduction, than would have been the case for a lump being
bodily moved. However, reduction would still occur, according to this
scheme, even though there is no macroscopic overall movement.
   Recall the material obstruction that intercepted the photon beam, in our
discussion of quantum interference in §5 .8. The mere absorption-or
potentiality for absorption-of a photon by such an obstruction would be
sufficient to effect R, despite the fact that nothing macroscopic would occur
that is actually observable. This also shows how a sufficient disturbance in an
environment that is entangled with some system under consideration would
itself effect R and so contact is made with more conventional FAPP
procedures.
   Indeed, in almost any practical measuring process it would be very likely
that large numbers of microscopic particles in the surrounding environment
would become disturbed. According to the ideas being put forward here, it
would often be this that would be the dominant effect, rather than
macroscopic bodily movement of objects, as with the 'lump displacement'
initially described above. Unless the experimental situation is very carefully
controlled, any macroscopic movement of a sizeable object would disturb
large amounts of the surrounding environment, and it is probable that the
environment's reduction time-perhaps about 10 1 30/b 3 , where b is the radius
of the region of water-density entangled environment under consideration­
would dominate (i .e. be much smaller than) the time 1 0 186/a 5 that might be
relevant to the object itself. For example, if the radius b of disturbed
environment were as little as about a tenth of a millimetre, then reduction
would take place in something of the order of a millionth of a second for that
reason alone.
    Such a picture has a lot in common with the conventional description that
was discussed in §6.6, but now we have a definite criterion for R actually to
occur in this environment. Recall the objections that were raised in §6.6 to the
conventional FAPP picture, as a description of an actual physical reality.
 With a criterion such as the one being promoted ·here, these objections no
longer hold. Once there is a sufficient disturbance in the environment,
 according to the present ideas, reduction will rapidly actually take place in that
 environment-and it would be accompanied by reduction in any 'measuring
 apparatus' with which that environment is entangled . Nothing could reverse
 that reduction and enable the original entangled state to be resurrected, even
 imagining enormous advances in technology. Accordingly, there is no
 contradiction with the measuring apparatus actually registering either YES or
 NO-as in the present picture it would indeed do.
    I imagine that a description of this nature would be relevant in many
 biological processes, and it would provide the likely reason that biological
 structures of a size much smaller than a micron's diameter can, no doubt, often
                           Quantum theory and reality                        343

behave as classical objects. A biological system, being very much entangled
with its environment in the manner discussed above, would have its own state
continually reduced because of the continual reduction of this environment.
We may imagine, on the other hand, that for some reason it might be
favourable to a biological system that its state remain unreduced for a long
time, in appropriate circumstances. In such cases it would be necessary for the
system to be, in some way, very effectively insulated from its surroundings.
These considerations will be important for us later ( §7 .5).
   A point that should be emphasized is that the energy that defines the lifetime
of the superposed state is an energy difference, and not the total, (mass-)
energy that is involved in the situation as a whole. Thus, for a lump that is
quite large but does not move very much-and supposing that it is also
crystalline, so that its individual atoms do not get randomly displaced­
quantum superpositions could be maintained for a long time. The lump could
be much larger than the water droplets considered above. There could also be
other very much larger masses in the vicinity, provided that they do not get
significantly entangled with the superposed state we are concerned with.
(These considerations would be important for solid-state devices, such as
gravitational wave detectors, that use coherently oscillating solid-perhaps
crystalline-bodies. 1 3 )
   So far, the orders of magnitude seem to be quite plausible, but clearly more
work is needed to see whether the idea will survive more stringent
examination. A crucial test would be to find experimental situations in which
standard theory would predict effects dependent upon large-scale qJ.Iantum
superpositions, but at a level where the present proposals demand that such
superpositions cannot be maintained. If the conventional quantum expecta­
tions are supported by observation, in such situations, then the ideas that I am
promoting would have to be abandoned-or at least severely modified. If
observation indicates that the superpositions are not maintained, then that
would lend some support to the present ideas. Unfortunately, I am not aware
of any practical suggestions for appropriate experiments, as yet. Superconduc­
tors, and devices such as SQUIDs (that depend upon the large-scale quantum
superpositions that occur with superconductors), would seem to present a
promising area of experiment relevant to these issues (see Leggett 1 984).
However, the ideas I am promoting would need some further development
before they could be directly applied in these situations. With superconduc­
tors, very little mass displacement occurs between the different superposed
states. There is a significant momentum displacement instead, however, and the
present ideas would need some further theoretical development in order to
cover this situation.
   The ideas put forward above would need to be reformulated somewhat,
even to treat the simple situation of a cloud chamber-where the presence of a
charged particle is signalled by the condensation of small droplets out of the
surrounding vapour. Suppose that we have a quantum state of a charged
344                        Quantum theory and reality


particle consisting of a linear superposition of the particle being at some
location in the cloud chamber and of the particle being outside the chamber.
The part of the particle's state vector that is within the chamber initiates the
formation of a droplet, but the part for which the particle is outside does not,
so that state now consists of a superposition of two macroscopically different
states. In one of these there is a droplet forming from the vapour and in the
other, there is just uniform vapour. We need to estimate the gravitational
energy involved in pulling the vapour molecules away from their counterparts,
in the two states that are being considered in superposition. However, now
there is an additional complication because there is also a difference between
the gravitational self-energy of the droplet and of the uncondensed vapour. In
order to cover such situations, a different formulation of the above suggested
criterion may be appropriate. We can now consider the gravitational self­
energy of that mass distribution which is the difference between the mass
distributions of the two states that are to be considered in quantum linear
superposition. The reciprocal of this self-energy gives an alternative proposal
for the reduction timescale (cf. Penrose 1 994b). In fact, this alternative
formulation gives just the same result as before, in those situations considered
earlier, but it gives a somewhat different (more rapid) reduction time in the
case of a cloud chamber. Indeed, there are various alternative general schemes
for reduction times, giving different answers in certain situations, although
agreeing with each other for the simple two-state superposition involving a
rigid displacement ·of a lump, as envisaged at the beginning of this section. The
original such scheme is that of Di6si (1 989) (which encountered some
difficulties, as pointed out by Ghirardi, Grassi, and Rimini (1 990), who also
suggested a remedy). I shall not distinguish between these various proposals
here, which will all come under the heading of 'the proposal of §6. 1 2' in the
following chapters.
   What are the motivations for the specific proposal for a 'reduction time' that
is being put forward here? My own initial motivations (Penrose 1 993a) were
rather too technical for me to describe here and were, in any case, inconclusive
and incomplete.14 I shall present an independent case for this kind of physical
scheme in a moment. Though also incomplete as it stands, the argument seems
to suggest a powerful underlying consistency requirement that gives
additional support for believing that state reduction must ultimately be a
gravitational phenomenon of the general nature of the one being proposed
here.
   The problem of energy conservatilm in the GRW-type schemes was already
referred to in §6.9. The 'hits' that particles are involved in (when their
wavefunctions get spontaneously multiplied by Gaussians) cause small
violations of energy conservation to take place. Moreover, there seems to be a
non-local transfer of energy with this kind of process. This would appear to be
a characteristic-and apparently unavoidable feature-of theories of this
general type, where the R-procedure is taken to be a real physical effect. To my
                            Quantum theory and reality                           345


mind, this provides strong additional evidence for theories in which
gravitational effects play a crucial role in the reduction pro eess. For energy
conservation in general relativity is a subtle and elusive issue. The
gravitational field itself contains energy, and this energy measurably
contributes to the total energy (and therefore to the mass, by Einstein's
E=mc 2) of a system. Yet it is a nebulous energy that inhabits empty space in a
mysterious non-local way.15 Recall, in particular, the mass-energy that is
carried away, in the form of gravitational waves, from the binary pulsar system
PSR 1 9 1 3 + 16 (cf. §4.5); these waves are ripples in the very structure of empty
space. The energy that is contained in the mutual attractive fields of the two
neutron stars is also an important ingredient of their dynamics which cannot
be ignored. But this kind of energy, residing in empty space, is of an especially
slippery kind . lt cannot be obtained by the 'adding up' oflocal contributions of
energy density; nor can it even be localized in any particular region of
space-time (see ENM, pp. 220-1 ).1t is tempting to relate the equally slippery
non-local energy problems of the R-procedure to those of classical gravity, and
to offset one against the other so as to provide a coherent overall picture.
   Do the suggestions that I have been putting forward here achieve this
overall coherence? I believe that there is a very good chance that they can be
made to, but the precise framework for achieving this is not yet to hand. One
can see, however, that there is certainly good scope for this in principle. For, as
mentioned earlier, we can think of the reduction process as something rather
like the decay of an unstable particle or nucleus. Think of the superposed state
of a lump in two different locations as being like an unstable nucleus that
decays, after a characteristic 'half-life' timescale, into something else more
stable. In the case of the superposed lump locations we likewise think of an
unstable quantum state which decays, after a characteristic lifetime (given,
roughly on average, by the reciprocal of the gravitational energy of
separation), to a state where the lump is in one location or the other­
representing two possible decay modes.
   Now in the decays of particles or nuclei, the lifetime (say, the half-life) of the
decay process is the reciprocal of a small uncertainty in mass-energy of the
initial particle-an effect of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. (For example,
the mass of an unstable polonium-210 nucleus, which decays on the emission
of an tX-particle into a lead nucleus, is not precisely defined, with an uncertainty
that is of the order of the reciprocal of the decay time-in this case, about 1 3 8
                                                             3
days, giving a mass uncertainty o f only about 10- 4 o f the mass o f the
polonium nucleus ! For individual unstable particles, however, the uncertainty
is a much larger proportion of the mass. ) Thus, the 'decay' that is involved in
the reduction process should also involve an essential uncertainty in the
energy of the initial state. This uncertainty, according to the present proposal,
lies essentially in the uncertainty of the gravitational self-energy of the
superposed state. Such a gravitational self-energy involves the nebulous non­
local field energy that causes so much difficulty in general relativity, and which
346                          Quantum theory and reality

is not provided by the adding up of local energy density contributions. It also
involves the essential uncertainty of identifying the points in two superposed
different space-time geometries referred to in §6. 10. If we indeed regard this
gravitational contribution as representing an essential 'uncertainty' in the
energy of the superposed state, then we get agreement with the lifetime for that
state that is being proposed here. Thus, the present scheme seems to provide a
clear link of consistency between the two energy problems, and is at least
highly suggestive of the possibility that a fully coherent theory might
eventually be found along these lines.
   Finally, there are two important questions that are of particular relevance
for us here. First : what possible roles might such considerations have for brain
action? Second: are there any reasons to expect, on purely physical grounds,
that non-computability (of the appropriate kind) might be a feature of this
gravitationally induced reduction process? We shall find, in the next chapter,
that there are indeed some intriguing possibilities.

         Quantum theory and the brain




   7.1 Large-scale quantum action in brain function ?
Brain action, according to the conventional viewpoint, is to be understood in
terms of essentially classical physics--or so it would seem. Nerve signals are
normally taken to be 'on or off' phenomena, just as are the currents in the
electronic circuits of a computer, which either take place or do not take place­
with none of the mysterious superpositions of alternatives that are character­
istic of quantum actions. Whilst it would be admitted that, at underlying levels,
quantum effects must have their roles to play, biologists seem to be generally of
the opinion that there is no necessity to be forced out of a classical framework
when discussing the large-scale implications of those primitive quantum
ingredients. The chemical forces that control the interactions of atoms and
molecules are indeed quantum mechanical in origin, and it is largely chemical
action that governs the behaviour of the neurotransmitter substances that
transfer signals from one neuron to another-across tiny gaps that are called
synaptic clefts. Likewise, the action potentials that physically control nerve­
signal transmission itself have an admittedly quantum-mechanical origin. Yet
it seems to be generally assumed that it is quite adequate to model the
behaviour of neurons themselves, and their relationships with one another, in
a completely classical way. lt is widely believed, accordingly, that it should be
entirely appropriate to model the physical functioning of the brain as a whole,
as a classical system, where the more subtle and mysterious features of
quantum physics do not significantly enter the description.
   This would have the implication that any possible significant activity that
might take place in a brain is indeed to be taken as either 'occurring' or 'not
occurring'. The strange superpositions of quantum theory, that would allow
simultaneous 'occurring' and 'not occurring'-with complex-number weight­
ing factors-would, accordingly, be considered to play no significant role.
Whilst it might be accepted that at some submicroscopic level of activity such
quantum superpositions do 'really' take place, it would be felt that the
interference effects that are characteristic of such quantum phenomena would
have no role at the relevant larger scales. Thus, it would be considered
                           Quantum theory and the brain                          349


adequate to treat any such superpositions as though they were statistical
mixtures, and the classical modelling of brain activity would be perfectly
satisfactory FAPP.
   There are certain dissenting opinions from this, however. In particula(, the
renowned neurophysiologist John Eccles has argued for the importance of
quantum effects in synaptic action (see, in particular, Beck and Eccles ( 1 992),
Eccles ( 1994)). He points to the presynaptic vesicular grid-a paracrystalline
hexagonal lattice in the brain's pyramidal cells-as being an appropriate
quantum site. Also, some people (even including myself; cf. ENM, pp.
400-401 , and Penrose 1 987) have tried to extrapolate from the fact that light­
sensitive cells in the retina (which is technically part of the brain) can respond
to a small number of photons (Hecht et al. 1 94 1 )-sensitive even to a single
photon (Baylor et al. 1 979), in appropriate circumstances-and to speculate
that there might be neurons in the brain, proper, that are also essentially
quantum detection devices.
   With the possibility that quantum effects might indeed trigger much larger
activities within the brain, some people have expressed the hope that, in such
circumstances, quantum indeterminancy might be what provides an opening
for the mind to influence the physical brain. Here, a dualistic viewpoint would
be likely to be adopted, either explicitly or implicitly. Perhaps the 'free will' of
an 'external mind' might be able to influence the quantum choices that actually
result from such non-deterministic processes. On this view, it is presumably
through the action of quantum theory's R-process that the dualist's
'mind-stuff' would have its influence on the behaviour of the brain.
   The status of such suggestions is unclear to me, especially since, in standard
quantum theory, quantum indeterminancy does not occur at quantum-level
scales, since it is the deterministic D-evolution that always holds at this level. It
is only in the magnification process from the quantum to the classical levels
that the indeterminancy of R is deemed to occur. On the standard F APP
viewpoint, this indeterminancy is something that 'takes place' only when
sufficient amounts of the environment become entangled with the quantum
event. In fact, as we have seen in §6.6, on the standard view it is not even clear
what 'taking place' actually means. It would be hard, on conventional
quantum-physical grounds, to maintain that the theory does actually allow an
indeterminancy to occur just at the level where a single quantum particle, such
as a photon, atom, or small molecule, is critically involved. When (for
example) a photon's wavefunction encounters a photon-sensitive cell, it sets in
train a sequence of events that remains deterministic (action of U) so long as
the system can be considered to stay 'at the quantum level' . Eventually,
significant amounts of the environment become disturbed and, on the
conventional view, one considers that R has occurred FAPP. One would have
to contend that the 'mind-stuff' somehow influences the system only at this
indeterminate stage.
   According to the viewpoint on state reduction that I have myself been
350                           Quantum theory and the brain


promoting in this book (cf. §6. 1 2), to find the level at which the R-process
actually becomes operative, we must look to the quite large scales that become
relevant when considerable amounts of material (microns to millimetres in
diameter-or perhaps a good deal more, if no significant mass movement is
involved) become entangled in the quantum state. (I shall henceforth denote
this fairly specific but putative procedure by OR, which stands for objective
reduction*. In any case, if we try to adhere to the above dualist viewpoint,
where we are looking for somewhere where an external 'mind' might have an
influence on physical behaviour-presumably by replacing the pure random­
ness of quantum theory by something more subtle-then we must indeed find
how the 'mind's' influence could enter at a much larger scale than single
quantum particles. We must look to wherever the cross-over point occurs
between the quantum and classical levels. As we have seen in the previous
chapter, there is no general agreement about what, whether, or where such a
cross-over point might be.
    In my own opinion, it is not very helpful, from the scientific point of view, to
think of a dualistic 'mind' that is (logically) external to the body, somehow
influencing the choices that seem to arise in the action of R. If the 'will' could
somehow influence Nature's choice of alternative that occurs with R, then why
is an experimenter not able, by the action of 'will power', to influence the result
of a quantum experiment? If this were possible, then violations of the quantum
probabilities would surely be rife ! For myself, I cannot believe that such a
picture can be close to the truth. To have an external 'mind-stuff' that is not
itself subject to physical laws is taking us outside anything that could be
reasonably called a scientific explanation, and is resorting to the viewpoint �
 (cf. § 1 .3).
    It is hard, however, to argue against such a viewpoint in a rigorous way,
since by its very nature it is devoid of the clear rules that would allow it to be
subject to scientific argument. Those readers who, for whatever reason, retain
a conviction (viewpoint �) that science must remain forever incompetent to
address issues of the mind, I ask merely that they continue to bear with me to
see what room there might eventually be found within a science which will
undoubtedly become extended far beyond the limited scope that it admits
today. If the 'mind' is something quite external to the physical body, it is hard
to see why so many of its attributes can be very closely associated with
properties of a physical brain. My own viewpoint is that we must search more
         *In ENM I used the description 'correct quantum gravity'-abbreviated
      CQG-for this kind of thing. Here the emphasis is a little different. I do not wish to
      stress the connection of this procedure with the profound problem of finding a fully
      coherent theory of quantum gravity. The emphasis is more on a procedure that
      would be in line with the specific suggestions put forward in §6.12, but together with
      some fundamental missing non-computational ingredient. The use of the acronym
      OR has the additional point that, in an objective reduction procedure, the physical
      result is indeed one thing or the other, in place of the combined superposition that .
      had occurred before.

deeply within the actual physical 'material' structures that constitute brains­
and also more deeply into the very question of what a 'material' structure, at
the quantum level of things, actually is! In my view, there is ultimately no
escape from having to probe more profoundly into the truths that actually lie
at the roots of Nature.
   Be that as it may, at least one thing seems to be clear. We must not look
simply to the quantum effects of single particles, atoms, or even small
molecules, but to the effects of quantum systems that retain their manifest
quantum nature at a much larger scale. If there is no large-scale quantum
coherence involved, then there would be no chance of any of the subtle
quantum-level effects, such as non-locality, quantum parallelism (several
superposed actions being carried out simultaneously), or effects ot counterfac­
tuality, having any significance when the classical level of brain activity is
reached. Without adequate 'shielding' of the quap.tum state from its
environment, such effects would become immediately lost in the randomness
inherent in that environment-i.e. in the random motions of those biological
materials and fluids that constitute the bulk of the brain.
   What is quantum coherence? This phenomenon refers to circumstances
when large numbers of particles can collectively cooperate in a single quantum
state which remains essentially unentangled with its environment. (The word
'coherence' refers, generally, to the fact that oscillations at different places beat
time with one another. Here, with quantum coherence, we are concerned with
the oscillatory nature of the wavefunction, and the coherence refers to the fact
that we are dealing with a single quantum state.) Such states occur most
dramatically in the phenomena of superconductivity (where electrical
resistance drops to zero) and superfluidity (where fluid friction, or viscosity,
drops to zero). The characteristic ingredient of such phenomena is the
presence of an energy gap that has to be breached by the environment if it is to
disturb this quantum state. If the temperature in that environment is too high,
so that the energy of many of the ambient particles is great enough for them to
breach this gap and entangle with the state, then the quantum coherence is
destroyed . Consequently, phenomena of the nature of superconductivity and
superfluidity have been found normally to occur only at very low tempera­
tures, just a few degrees above absolute zero. For reasons such as this, there
had been a general scepticism about the possibility of quantum coherence
effects having any relevance to such a 'hot' object as the human brain-or,
indeed, any other biological system.
   In recent years, however, some remarkable experimental findings have
shown that, with suitable substances, superconductivity can occur at very
much higher temperatures, even up to 1 1 5 K (cf. Sheng et al. 1988). This is still
very cold, from the biological point of view, being about -1 5 8°C or -2 1 2°F,
only a little warmer than liquid nitrogen. But even more remarkable still are
the observations of Lagues et al. (1993) which seem to indicate the presence of
superconductivity at the merely 'Siberian' temperatures - 23°C or - 1 0°F.

Though still somewhat on the 'cold' side, in biological terms, such
high-temperature superconductivity gives some strong support to the conjec­
ture that there could be quantum-coherent effects that are indeed relevant to
biological systems.
   In fact, long before the phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity
was observed, the distinguished physicist Herbert Frohlich (who, in the 1930s
had made one of the fundamental breakthroughs in the understanding of
'ordinary' low-temperature superconductivity) suggested a possible role for
collective quantum effects in biological systems. This work was stimulated by
a puzzling phenomenon that had been observed in biological membranes as
far back as 1938, and Frohlich was led to propose, in 1 968 (employing a
concept due to my brother Oliver Penrose and Lars Onsager ( 1956}--a s I
learnt to my surprise when looking into these matters), that there should be
vibrational effects within active cells, which would resonate with microwave
electromagnetic radiation, at 101 1 Hz, as a result of a biological quantum
coherence phenomenon. Instead of needing a low temperature, the effects arise
from the existence of a large energy of metabolic drive. There is now some
respectable observational evidence, in many biological systems, for precisely
the kind of effect that Frohlich had predicted in 1 968. We shall try to see later
(§7.5) what relevance this might have to brain action.


            7.2 Neurons, synapses , and computers
So far, although it is encouraging to find a distinct possibility of quantum
coherence having a genuinely significant role to play in biological systems,
there is, as yet, no clear link between this and what might be directly relevant in
brain activity. Much of our understanding of the brain, though still very
rudimentary, had led us to a classical picture (essentially one put forward by
McCullogh and Pitts back in 1 943) in which neurons and their connecting
synapses seem to play a role essentially similar to those of transistors and wires
(printed circuits) in the electronic computers of today. In more detail, the
                               Quantum theory and the brain                                   353

biological picture is of classical nerve signals travelling out from the central
bulb (soma) of the neuron, along the very long fibre called an axon, this axon
bifurcating into separate strands at various places (Fig. 7 . 1 ). Each strand
finally terminates at a synapse-the junction at which the signal is transferred,
usually to a subsequent neuron, across a synaptic cleft. It is at this stage that
the neurotransmitter chemicals carry the message that the previous neuron
has fired, by moving from one cell (neuron) to the next. This synaptic junction
would often occur at the treelike dendrite of the next neuron, or else on its
soma. Some synapses are excitatory in nature, with neurotransmitters that
tend to enhance the firing of the next neuron, whereas some are inhibitory, and
their (different) neurotransmitter chemicals tend to inhibit a neuron's firing.
The effects of the different synaptic actions on the next neuron essentially add
up ('plus' for excitatory and 'minus' for inhibitory), and when a certain
threshold is reached, the next neuron will fire.* More correctly there would be
a strong probability that it would fire. In all such processes, there would be
certain chance factors involved also.
   There is, at least so far, no question but that this picture is one that could in
principle be effectively simulated computationally, assuming that the synaptic
connections and their individual strengths are kept fixed. (The random
ingredients would, of course, pose no computational problem, cf. §1 .9).
Indeed, it is not hard to see that the neuron-synapse picture that is presented
here (with fixed synapses and fixed strengths) is essentially equivalent to that of
a computer (cf. ENM, pp. 392-6). However, because of a phenomenon known
as brain plasticity, the strengths of at least some of these connections may
change from time to time, perhaps even in a timescale of less than a second, as
may the very connections themselves. An important question is: what
procedures govern these synaptic changes?
   In the connectionist models (as are adopted for artificial neural networks),
there is a computational rule of some kind governing the synaptic changes. This
rule would be specified in such a way that the system can improve on its past
performance on the basis of certain preassigned criteria in relation to its
external inputs. As far back as 1 949, Donald Hebb suggested a simple rule of
this kind. Modern connectionist models 1 have considerably modified the
original Hebb procedure in various ways. In general models of this kind, there
clearly has to be some clear-cut computational rule-because the models are
always things that can be enacted by an ordinary computer; cf. § 1 . 5 . But the
         *At least, this has been the conventional picture. There is now some evidence that
      this simple 'additive' description may be a considerable over-simplification, and
      some 'information processing' is likely to be taking place within the dendrites of
      individual neurons. This possibility has been emphasized by Karl Pribram and
      others (cf. Pribram 1991). Some early suggestions along these general lines were
      made by Alwyn Scott (1973, 1977; and for the possibility of 'intelligence' within
      individual eells cf. Albrecht-Buehler 1985, for example). That there may be
      complex 'dendritic processing' taking place within single neurons is consistent with
      the discussion of §7 .4.
3 54                       Quantum theory and the brain


thrust of the arguments that I have put forward in Part I is that no such
computational procedure could be adequate to explain all the operational
manifestations of human conscious understanding. Thus, we must look for
something different, as the appropriate type of controlling 'mechanism'-at
least in the case of synaptic changes that might have some relevance to actual
conscious activity.
   Certain other ideas have been suggested, such as those of Gerald Edelman
in his recent book Bright A ir, Brilliant Fire ( 1 992) (and his earlier trilogy
Edelman 1 987, 1988, 1 989), in which it is proposed that rather than having
rules of a Hebbian type, a form of 'Darwinian' principle operates within the
brain, enabling it to improve its performance continually by means of a kind of
natural selection principle that governs these connections-there being, in this
model, significant associations with the way the immune system develops its
facility to 'recognize' substances . Importance is placed on the complicated role
of the neurotransmitter and other chemicals that are involved in communicat­
ing between neurons. However, these processes, as they are presently
conceived, are still treated in a classical and computational way. Indeed,
Edelman and his colleagues have constructed a series of computationally
controlled devices (called DARWIN I, II, III, IV, etc.) that are intended to
simulate, in increasing orders of complexity, the very kinds of procedure that
he is proposing lie at the basis of mental action. By the very fact that an
ordinary general-purpose computer carries out the controlling action, it
follows that this particular scheme is still a computational one-with some
particular 'bottom-up' system of rules. It does not matter how different in
detail such a scheme might be from other computational procedures. It still
comes under the heading of those included under the discussion of Part 1---d.
particularly § 1 .5, §3 .9, and the arguments that are summarized in the fantasy
dialogue of §3.23. Those arguments alone render it exceedingly improbable
that anything that is solely of this nature can provide an actual model of the
conscious mind.
   In order to escape from the computational strait-jacket, some other means
of controlling synaptic connections is needed-and whatever it is, it must
presumably involve some physical process in which some form of quantum
coherence has a significant role to play. If that process is similar in an essential
way to the action of the immune system, then the immune system itself must be
dependent on quantum effects. Perhaps, indeed, there is something in the
particular way in which the immune system's recognition mechanism operates
that has an essentially quantum character-as has been argued, in particular,
by Michael Conrad (1 990, 1 992, 1 993). This would not surprise me; but such
possible roles for quantum action in the operation of the immune system do
not form any key part of Edelman's model of the brain.
   Even if synaptic connections are controlled in some way by coherent
 quantum-mechanical effects, it is difficult to see that there can be anything
essentially quantum-mechanical about actual nerve-signal activity. That is to
                           Quantum theory and the brain                          355


say, it is hard to see how one could usefully consider a quantum superposition
consisting of one neuron .firing , and simultaneously not .firing. Nerve signals
would appear to be quite sufficiently macroscopic to make it hard to believe in
such a picture, despite the fact that nerve transmission is indeed rather well
insulated by the presence of the nerve's surrounding fatty sheath of myelin. On
the view (OR) that I have been promoting in §6. 1 2, we must expect that
objective state reduction would take place rapidly when a neuron fires, not
because there is much large-scale movement of mass (there is not nearly
enough, by the standards required), but because the electric field propagating
along the nerve-caused by the nerve signal-would be likely to be detectable
in the surrounding environment of material in the brain. This field would
disturb, in random ways, reasonably large amounts of that material-quite
enough, it would seem, that the criterion of §6. 1 2 for the enaction of OR
should be satisfied almost as soon as the signal is initiated. Thus, the
maintaining of quantum superpositions of neuron firings and neuron not­
firings seems an implausible possibility.




                     7.3 Quantum computation
This environment-disturbing property of neuron firing is the feature that I had
always found to be most uncomfortable for the rough kind of proposal that I
had previously argued for in ENM, in which quantum superposition of the
simultaneous firing and non-firing of families of neurons seems indeed to be
needed. With the present OR criterion for state reduction, the process R would
be effected with even less of an environmental disturbance than would have
been the case before, and it is even harder to believe in the possibility that such
superpositions could be significantly maintained. The idea had been that if it
were possible to perform many superposed separate 'calculations' in different
patterns of neuron firing simultaneously, then something of the nature of a
quantum computation would be achieved by the brain, rather than mere Turing
computation . Despite the apparent implausibility of quantum computation
being operative at this level of brain activity, it will be helpful for us to examine
certain aspects of what is involved in this notion.
   Quantum computation is a theoretical concept that had been put forward in
its essentials by David Deutsch ( 1 985) and Richard Feynman (1985, 1986) cf.
also Benioff (1 982), Albert (1983), and is now being actively explored by a
number of people. The idea is that the classical notion of a Turing machine is
extended to a corresponding quantum one. Accordingly, all the various
operations that this extended 'machine' undertakes are subject to the quantum
laws-with superpositions allowed-that apply to a quantum-level system.
Thus, for the most part, it is the action of U that governs the evolution of the
device, with the preservation of such superpositions being an essential part of
356                       Quantum theory and the brain


its action. The R-procedure would become relevant mainly only at the end of
the operation, when the system is 'measured' in order to ascertain the result of
the computation. In fact (although this is not always recognized) the action of
R must also be invoked from time to time in a more minor way during the
course of the computation, in order to ascertain whether or not the
computation has yet terminated.
   It is found that although a quantum computer cannot achieve anything
beyond what could already be done in principle by conventional Turing
computation, there are certain classes of problem for which quantum
computation is able to outperform Turing computation in the sense of
complexity theory (cf. Deutsch 1 985). That is to say for these classes of problem,
the quantum computer is in principle muchfaster-but merely faster-than the
conventional computer. See, particularly, Deutsch and Jozsa ( 1992) for a class
of interesting (yet somewhat artificial) problems in which the quantum
computer excels. Moreover, the important problem of factorizing large integers
can now be solved (in polynomial time) by quantum computation, according to
a recent argument by Peter Shor.
   In 'standard' quantum computation, the usual rules of quantum theory are
adopted, in which the system carries on according to the procedure U for
essentially the entire operation, but where R comes in at certain specified places.
There is nothing 'non-computational' in such a procedure, in the ordinary sense
of 'computational', since U is a computable operation and R is a purely
probabilistic procedure. What can be achieved in principle by a quantum
computer could also be achieved, in principle, by a suitable Turing-machine­
with-randomizer. Thus, even a quantum computer would not be able to
perform the operations required for human conscious understanding, according
to the arguments of Part I. The hope would have to be that the subtleties of what
is really going on when the state vector 'appears' to get reduced, rather than just
the stop-gap random procedure R, would lead us to something genuinely
non-computable. Thus, the complete theory of the putative OR process would
have to be an essentially non-computable scheme.
    The idea in ENM had been that superposed Turing computations could be
carried on for a while, but these would be interspersed with some non­
 computable action that could only be understood in terms of whatever new
physics would come in (e.g. OR) to replace R. But if such superpositions of
 neuron computations are forbidden to us, because too much of the environment
 gets disturbed by each neuron signal, then it is hard to see how it could be
 possible even to make use of the idea of standard quantum computation, let
 alone any modification of this procedure that takes advantage of some putative
 non-computational R-replacement such as OR. However, we shall be seeing in a
 moment that there is another much more promising possibility. In order to
 understand how this might be the case, we shall have to look more deeply into
 the biological nature of brain cells.

              7.4 Cytoskeletons and microtubules
If we are to believe that neurons are the only things that control the
sophisticated actions of animals, then the humble paramecium presents us with
a profound problem. For she swims about her pond with her numerous tiny
hairlike legs-the cilia-darting in the direction of bacterial food which she
senses using a variety of mechanisms, or retreating at the prospect of danger,
ready to swim off in another direction. She can also negotiate obstructions by
swimming around them. Moreover, she can apparently even learn from her past
experiences 2-though this most remarkable of her apparent faculties has been
disputed by some3• How is all this achieved by an animal without a single
neuron or synapse? Indeed, being but a single cell, and not being a neuron
herself, she has no place to accommodate such accessories (see Fig. 7 .2).
   Yet there must indeed be a complicated control system governing the
behaviour of a paramecium-or indeed other one-celled animals like amoe­
bas-but it is not a nervous system. The structure responsible is apparently part
of what is referred to as the cytoskeleton. As its name suggests, the cytoskeleton
provides the framework that holds the cell in shape, but it does much more. The

      tubes (microtubules) organized in a structure with a fan-like cross-section.

cilia themselves are endings of the cytoskeletal fibres, but the cytoskeleton seems
also to contain the control system for the cell, in addition to providing 'conveyor
belts' for the transporting of various molecules from one place to another. In
short, the cytoskeleton appears to play a role for the single cell rather like a
combination of skeleton, muscle system, legs, blood circulatory system, and
nervous system all rolled into one !
   It is the cytoskeleton's role as the cell's 'nervous system' that will have the
main importance for us here. For our own neurons are themselves single cells,
and each neuron has its own cytoskeleton ! Does this mean that there is a sense in
which each individual neuron might itself have something akin to its own
'personal nervous system'? This is ap intriguing issue, and a number of scientists
have been coming round to the view that something of this general nature might
actually be true. (See Stuart Hameroffs pioneering 1 987 book Ultimate
Computing: Biomolecular Consciousness and NanoTechnology; also Hamerotf
and Watt (1982) and numerous articles in the new journal Nanobiology. )
   I n order t o address such issues, we should first glimpse the basic organization
of the cytoskeleton. It consists of protein-like molecules arranged in various
types of structure: actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. It is the
microtubules that will be our main concern here. They consist of hollow
cylindrical tubes, some 25 nm in diameter on the outside and 14 nm on the
inside (where 'nm' = 'nanometre', which is 10-9 m), sometimes organized into
larger tubelike fibres that consist of nine doublets, triplets, or partial triplets, of
microtubules, organized in an arrangement with a fanlike cross-section, as
indicated in Fig. 7.3, with sometimes a pair of microtubules running down the
centre. The paramecium's cilia are structures of this kind. Each microtubule is
itself a protein polymer consisting of subunits referred to as tubulin. Each
                            Quantum theory and the brain                            359

                                two conformations.




tubulin subunit is a 'dimer', i.e. it consists of two essentially separate parts called
cx-tubulin and P-tubulin each being composed of about 450 amino acids. It is a
globular protein pair, somewhat 'peanut shaped' and organized in a slightly
skew hexagonal lattice along the entirety of the tube, as indicated in Fig. 7 .4.
There are generally 13 columns of tubulin dimers to each microtubule. Each
dimer is about 8 nm x 4 nm x 4 nm and its atomic number is about 1 1 x l<f
(which means that it has about that many nucleons in it, so its mass, in absolute
units, is about 10- 1 4).
    Each tubulin dimer, as a whole, can exist in (at least) two different geometrical
configurations-called different c01iformations. In one of these, they bend to
about 30° to the direction of the microtubule. There is evidence that these two
conformations correspond to two different states of the dimer's electric
polarization, where these come about because an electron, centrally placed at
the cx-tubulin/P-tubulin juncture, can shift from one position to another.
    The 'control centre' of the cytoskeleton (if indeed this is really an appropriate
term) is a structure known as the centriole. This seems to consists essentially of
two cylinders of nine triplets of microtubules, where the cylinders form a kind of
separated 'T' (Fig. 7.5). (The cylinders are similar, in a general way, to those that
occur in cilia, as illustrated in Fig. 7.3.) The centriole forms the critical part of a
structure called the microtubules organizing centre or centrosome. Whatever the
role of the centriole might be during the normal course of an ordinary cell's
existence, it has �;tt least one fundamentally important task. At a critical stage,
each of the two cylinders in the centriole grows another, so as to make two
centriole 'T's that then separate from each other, each apparently dragging a
bundle of microtubules with it-although it would be more accurate to say that
each becomes a focal point around which microtubules assemble. These
microtubule fibres somehow connect the centriole to the separate DNA strands
in the nucleus (at central poiqts, known as their centromeres) and the DNA

      cytoskeleton-if such exists) consists essentially of a separated 'T' built
       from two bundles of microtubules very like that illustrated in Fig. 7 . 3 .

strands separate-initiating the extraordinary process technically known as
mitosis, which simply means cell division (see Fig. 7.6).
   It may seem odd that there should be two quite different 'headquarters' in a
single cell. On the one hand there is the nucleus, where the fundamental genetic
                            Quantum theory and the brain                        361

material of the cell resides, which controls the cell's heredity and its own
particular identity, and governs the production of the protein materials of which
the cell itself is composed. On the other hand, there is the centrosome with its
chief component the centriole, which seems to be the focal point of the
cytoskeleton, a structure that apparently controls the cell's movements and its
detailed organization. The presence of these two different structures in
eukaryotic cells (the cells of all animals and almost all plants on this planet-but
excluding bacteria, blue-green algae, and viruses) is believed to be the result of
an ancient 'infection' that took place some thousands of millions of years ago.
The cells that previously inhabited the earth were the prokaryotic cells that still
exist today as bacteria and blue-green algae, and which possess no cytoskele­
tons. One suggestion (Sagan 1 976) is that some early prokaryotes became
entangled with-or, perhaps, 'infected by'-some kind of spirochete, an
organism that swam with a whiplike tail composed of cytoskeletal proteins.
These mutually alien organisms subsequently grew to live permanently together
in a symbiotic relationship as single eukaryotic cells. Thus, these 'spirochetes'
ultimately became the cells' cytoskeletons-with all the implications for the
future evolution that thereby made us possible!
   The organization of mammalian microtubules is interesting from a
mathematical point of view. The number 1 3 might seem to have no particular
mathematical significance, but this is not entirely so. It is one of the famous
Fibonacci numbers:
                  0, 1 , 1 , 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 2 1 , 34, 55, 89, 144, . . .

where each successive number is obtained as a sum of the previous two. This
might be fortuitous, but Fibonacci numbers are well known to occur frequently
(at a much larger scale) in biological systems. For example, in fir cones,
sunflower heads, and palm tree trunks, one finds spiral or helical arrangements
involving the interpenetration of right-handed and left-handed twists, where the
number of rows for one handedness and the number for the other handedness
are two successive Fibonacci numbers (see Fig. 7.7). (As one examines the
structures from one end to the other, one may find that a 'shunt' takes place, and
the numbers then shift to an adjacent pair of successive Fibonacci numbers.)
Curiously, the skew hexagonal pattern of microtubules exhibits a very similar
feature-generally of an even more precise organization-and it is apparently
found (at least normally) that this pattern is made up of 5 right-handed and 8
left-handed helical arrangements, as depicted in Fig. 7.8. In Fig. 7.9, I have tried
to indicate how this structure might appear as actually 'viewed' from within a
microtubule. The number 1 3 features here in its role as the sum: 5 + 8. It is
curious, also, that the double microtubules that frequently occur seem normally
to have a total of 21 columns of tubulin dimers forming the outside boundary of
the composite tube-the next Fibonacci number ! (However, one should not get
carried away with such considerations; for example, the '9' that occurs in the
bundles of microtubules in cilia and centrioles is not a Fibonacci number. )

      Fig. 7. 7. A sunflower head. As with many other plants, Fibonacci numbers
      feature strongly. In the outer regions, there are 89 clockwise and 55 anti­
      clockwise spirals. Nearer the centre we can find other Fibonacci numbers.



   Why do Fibonacci numbers arise in microtubule structure? In the case of fir
cones and sunflower heads, etc., there are various plausible theories-and Alan
Turing himself was someone who thought seriously about the subject (Hodges
1983, p. 437). But it may well be that these theories are not appropriate for
microtubules, and different ideas are probably relevant at this level. Koruga
(1974) has suggested that these Fibonacci numbers may provide advantages for
the microtubule in its capacity as an 'information processor'. Indeed, Hameroff
and his colleagues have argued, for more than a decade4, that microtubules may
play roles as cellular automata, where complicated signals could be transmitted
and processed along the tubes as waves of differing electric polarization states of
the tubulins. Recall that tubulin dimers can exist in (at least) two different
conformational states that can switch from one to the other, apparently because
of alternative possibilities for their electric polarizations. The state of each dimer
would be influenced by the polarization states of each of its six neighbours
(because of van der Waals interactions between them) giving rise to certain
specific rules governing the conformation of each dimer in terms of the
conformations of its neighbours. This would allow all kinds of messages to be
propagated and processed along the length of each microtubule. These
propagating signals appear to be relevant to the way that microtubules

flat into a strip. We find that the tubulins are ordered in sloping lines
which rejoin at the opposite edge 5 or 8 places displaced (depending upon
            whether the lines slope to the right or to the left).

transport various molecules alongside them, and to the various interconnec­
tions between neighbouring microtubules-in the form of bridge-like connect­
ing proteins referred to as MAPs (microtubule associated proteins). See Fig.
7. 10. Koruga argues for a special efficiency in the case of a Fibonacci-number­
related structure of the kind that is actually observed for microtubules. There
must indeed be some good reason for this kind of organization in microtubules,
since although there is some variation in the numbers that apply to eukaryotic
cells generally, 13 columns seems to be almost universal amongst mammalian
microtubules.
   What is the significance of micro tubules for neurons? Each individual neuron
has its own cytoskeleton. What is its role? I am sure that there is a great deal to
be uncovered by future research, but it seems that already a fair amount is
known. In particular, microtubules in neurons can be very long indeed, in
comparison with their diameter (which is only about 25-30 nm) and can reach
lengths of millimetres or more. Moreover, they can grow or shrink, according to
circumstances, and transport neurotransmitter molecules. There are micro­
tubules running along the lengths of the axons and dendrites. Although single
microtubules do not seem to extend individually to the entire length of an axon,
they certainly form communicating networks that do so, each microtubule
communicating with the next ones by means of the connecting MAPs referred to
above. Microtubules seem to be responsible for maintaining the strengths of

synapses and, no doubt, for effecting alterations of these strengths when the need
arises. Moreover, they seem to organize the growth of new nerve endings,
guiding them towards their connections with other nerve cells.
   Since neurons do not divide after the brain is fully formed, there is not a role of
this particular kind for a centriole in a neuron. Indeed, centrioles seem to be
absent in the neuron's centrosome-which is found close to the neuron's
nucleus. Microtubules extend from there right up to the vicinity of the
presynaptic endings of the axon, and also, in the other direction, into the
dendrites and dendritic spines that frequently form the postsynaptic end of a
synaptic cleft. These spines are subject to growth and degeneration, a process
which seems to form an important part of brain plasticity, whereby the overall
interconnections in the brain are undergoing continual subtle changes. There
would seem to be significant evidence that microtubules are indeed importantly
involved in the control of brain plasticity.
   As an apparent curiosity, it may also be mentioned that in the presynaptic
endings of axons there are certain substances associated with microtubules
which are fascinating from the geometrical point of view, and which are
important in connection with the release of neurotransmitter chemicals. These
substances-called clathrins-are built from protein trimers known as clathrin
triskelions, which form three-pronged (polypeptide) structures. The clathrin
triskelions fit together to make beautiful mathematical configurations that are
identical in general organization to the carbon molecules known as 'fullerenes'
(or 'bucky balls') owing to their similarity with the famous geodesic domes
constructed by the American architect Buckminster Fuller. 5 Clathrins are much
larger than fullerene molecules, however, since an entire clathrin triskelion, a
structure involving several amino acids, takes the place of the fullerene's single
carbon atom. The particular clathrins that are concerned with the release of
neurotransmitter chemicals at synapses seem mainly to have the structure of a
truncated icosahedron-which is familiar as the polyhedron demonstrated in the
modem soccer ball (see Fig. 7 . 1 1 and 7.12)!

      Fig. 7.12. Clathrins, like those of Fig. 7.1 1 (and microtubule endings)
      inhabit the axon's synaptic boutons and seem to be involved in controlling
                      the strength of the synaptic connection.




   In the previous section, the important question was raised: what is it that
governs the variation in the strengths of synapses and organizes the places where
functioning synaptic connections are to be made? We have been guided to a
clear belief that it is the cytoskeleton that must play a central role in this process.
How does this help us in our quest for a non-computational role for the mind?
So far, all we seem to have gained is an enormous potential increase in
computing power over and above what could have been achieved if the units
were simply the neurons alone.
   Indeed, if tubulin dimers are the basic computational units, then we must
envisage the possibility of a potential computing power in the brain that vastly
exceeds that which has been contemplated in the AI literature. Hans Moravec,
in his book Mind Children (1988), assumed, on the basis of a 'neuron alone'
model, that the human brain might in principle conceivably achieve some 1014
basic operations per second, but no more, where we consider that there might be
some 101 1 operational neurons, each capable of sending about 103 signals per
second (cf. §1 .2). If, on the other hand, we consider the tubulin dimer as the basic
computational unit, then we must bear in mind that there are some 104 dimers
per neuron, the elementary operations now being performed some 106 times
faster, giving us a total of around 102 4 operations per second. Whereas
present-day computers may be beginning to close in on the first figure of 1 01 4
operations per second, as Moravec and others would strongly argue, there is no
prospect of the 102 4 figure being achieved in the foreseeable future.
   Of course it could reasonably be claimed that the brain is operating nowhere
remotely close to the 100% microtubular efficiency that these figures assume.
Nevertheless, it is clear that the possibility of 'microtubular computing' (cf.
 Hameroff 1 987) puts a completely different perspective on some of the
arguments for imminent human-level artificial intelligence. Can we even trust
 suggestions6 that the mental faculties of a nematode worm have already been
 computationally achieved merely because its neural organization appears to
                           Quantum theory and the brain                        367


have been mapped and computationally simulated? As remarked in § 1 . 1 5, the
actual capabilities of an ant seem to outstrip by far, anything that has been
achieved by the standard procedures of AI. One might well wonder how much
an ant gains from its enormous array of nano-level 'microtubular information
processors', as opposed to what it could do if it had only 'neuron-type switches'.
As for a paramecium, there is no case to answer.
   Yet the arguments of Part 1 are making a stronger claim. I am contending
that the faculty of human understanding lies beyond any computational
scheme whatever. If it is microtubules that control the activity of the brain,
then there must be something within the action of microtubules that is
different from mere computation. I have argued that such non-computational
action must be the result of some reasonably large-scale quantum-coherent
phenomenon, coupled in some subtle way to macroscopic behaviour, so that
the system is able to take advantage of whatever new physical processes must
replace the stop-gap R-procedure of present-day physics. As a first step, we
must look for a genuine role for quantum coherence in cytoskeletal activity.



      7.5 Quantum coherence within microtubules ?
Is there any evidence for this? Let us recall Frohlich's ( 1 975) ideas for the
possibility of quantum-coherent phenomena in biological systems, referred to
in the discussion of §7. 1 . He argued that so long as the energy of metabolic
drive is large enough, and the dielectric properties of the materials concerned
are sufficiently extreme, then there is the possibility of large-scale quantum
coherence similar to that which occurs in the phenomena of superconductivity
and superfluidity-sometimes referred to as Bose-Einstein condensation­
even at the relatively high temperatures that are present in biological systems.
It turns out that not only is the metabolic energy indeed high enough and the
dielectric properties unusually extreme (a striking observational fact of the
 1930s that started Frohlich on this whole line of thinking), but there is now
also some direct evidence for the 101 1 Hz oscillations within cells that Frohlich
had predicted (Grundler and Keilmann 1983).
   In a Bose-Einstein condensate (which occurs also in the action of a laser),
large numbers of particles participate collectively in a single quantum state.
There is a wavefunction, for this state, of the kind that would be appropriate
for a single particle-but now it applies all at once to the entire collection of
particles that are participating in the state. We recall the very counter-intuitive
nature of the (spread-out) quantum state of a single quantum particle ( §5 .6,
§5. 1 1 ). With a Bose-Einstein condensate, it is as though the entire system
containing a large number of particles behaves as a whole very much as the
quantum state of a single particle would, except that everything is scaled up
appropriately. There is a coherence on a large scale, where many of the strange
features of quantum wavefunctions hold at a macroscopic level.
368                            Quantum theory and the brain


   Frohlich's original ideas seem to have been that such large-scale quantum
states would be likely to occur in cell membranes*, but now the additional­
and perhaps more plausible-possibility presents itself that it is in the
microtubules that we should seek quantum behaviour of this kind. There
appears to be some evidence that this may be the case. 7 Even as early as 1 974,
Hameroff ( 1974) had proposed that microtubules might act as 'dielectric
waveguides'. It is indeed tempting to believe that Nature has chosen hollow
tubes in her cytoskeletal structures for some good purpose. Perhaps the tubes
themselves serve to provide the effective insulation that would enable the
quantum state in the interior of the tube to remain unentangled with its
environment for an appreciable time. It is interesting to note, in this
connection, that Emilio del Giudice, and his colleagues at the University of
Milan (del Giudice et al. 1983), have argued that a quantum self-focusing effect
of electromagnetic waves within the cytoplasmic material in cells causes
signals to be confined to a size that is just the internal diameter of
microtubules . This could give substance to the waveguide theory, but the effect
could also be instrumental in the very formation of microtubules.
    There is another matter of interest here, and this concerns the very nature of
water. The tubes themselves appear to be empty-a curious and possibly
significant fact in itself, if we are looking to these tubes to provide for us the
controlled conditions favourable to some kind of collective quantum
oscillations. 'Empty', here, means that they essentially contain just water
(without even dissolved ions). We might think that 'water', with its randomly
moving molecules, is not a sufficiently organized kind of structure for
quantum-coherent oscillations to be likely to occur. However, the water that is
found in cells is not at all like the ordinary water that is found in the
oceans--disordered, with molecules moving about in an incoherent random
way. Some of it-and it is a controversial matter how much-exists in an
ordered state (sometimes referred to as 'vicinal' water; cf. Hameroff ( 1 987),
p. 1 72). Such an ordered state of water may extend some 3 nm or more
outwards from cytoskeletal surfaces. It seems not unreasonable to suppose
that the water inside the microtubules is also of an ordered nature, and this
would strongly favour the possibility of quantum-coherent oscillations within,
or in relation to, these tubes. (See, in particular, Jibu et al. 1 994.)
    Whatever the ultimate status of these intriguing ideas, one thing seems clear
 to me: there is little chance that an entirely classical discussion of the
cytoskeleton could properly explain its behaviour. This is quite unlike the
 situation for neurons themselves, where discussions in entirely classical terms

         *A strong proponent of the idea that Bose-Einstein condensation may provide
      the 'unitary sense of self that seems to be characteristic of consciousness, in relation
      to Frohlich's ideas is Ian Marshall (1989), cf. also Zohar (1990), Zohar and
      Marshall (1994), and Lockwood (1989). A strong early proponent of global
      (essentially quantum) large-scale coherent 'hologram' activity in the brain was Karl
      Pribram (1966, 1975, 1991).
                            Quantum theory and the brain                          369


do seem to be largely appropriate. Indeed, an examination of the current
literature on cytoskeletal action reveals the fact that quantum-mechanical
concepts are continually being appealed to, and I have little doubt that this
will be increasingly the case in the future.
   However, it is also clear that there will be many who remain unconvinced
that there are likely to be any significant quantum effects of relevance to
cytoskeletal or brain action. Even if there are indeed important effects of a
quantum nature which are essential to microtubules' functioning and to
conscious brain action, it may not be easy to demonstrate their presence by
definitive experiment. If we are lucky, some of the standard procedures that
already serve to show the presence of Bose-Einstein condensates in physical
systems-such as with high-temperature superconductivity-may also be
found to be applicable in microtubules. On the other hand we may not be so
lucky, and something quite new is needed. One intriguing possibility might be
to demonstrate that microtubule excitations exhibit the kind of non-locality
that occurs with EPR phenomena (Bell inequalities, etc.; cf. §5 . 3 , §5 .4, §5. 1 7),
since there is no (local) classical explanation of effects of this kind. One might,
for example, imagine measurements being made at two points on a
microtubule-or on separate microtubules-where the results of the measure­
ments cannot be explained in terms of classical independent actions taking
place at these two points .
   Whatever the status of such suggestions, microtubule research is still in its
relative infancy. There is no doubt in my own mind that there are significant
surprises in store for us.



              7.6 Micro tubules and consciousness
Is there any direct evidence that the phenomenon of consciousness is related to
the action of the cytoskeleton, and to microtubules in particular? Indeed, there
is such evidence. Let us try to examine the nature of this evidence-which
addresses the issue of consciousness by considering what causes it to be absent!
   An important avenue towards answering questions concerning the physical
basis of consciousness comes from an examination of precisely what it is that
very specifically turns consciousness off. General anaesthetics have precisely
this property-completely reversibly, if the concentrations are not too high­
and it is a remarkable fact that general anaesthesia can be induced by a large
number of completely different substances that seem to have no chemical
relationship with one another whatever. Included in the list of general
anaesthetics are such chemically different substances as nitrous oxide (N 2 0),
ether (CH 3 CH 2 0CH 2 CH 3 ), chloroform (CHC1 3 ), halothane (CF 3 CHCIBr),
isofluorane (CHF 2 0CHClCF 3 ) and even the chemically inert gas xenon !
   If it is not chemistry that is responsible for general anaesthesia, then what
can it be that is responsible? There are other types of interaction that can take
3 70                       Quantum theory and the brain

place between molecules, which are much weaker than chemical forces. One of
these is referred to as the van der Waals force. The van der Waals force is a
weak attraction between molecules which have electric dipole moments (the
'electric' equivalent of the magnetic dipole moments that measure the strength
of ordinary magnets). Recall that tubulin dimers are capable of two different
conformations. These appear to arise because there is an electron, centrally
placed in a water-free region in each dimer, which can occupy one of two
separate positions. The overall shape of the dimer is affected by this
positioning, as is its electric dipole moment. The ability of the dimer's
capability of 'switching' from one conformation to the other is influenced by
the van der Waals force exerted by neighbouring substances. Accordingly, it
has been suggested (Hameroff and Watt 1983) that general anaesthetics may
act through the agency of their van der Waals interactions (in 'hydrophobic'
regions-where water has been expelled-see Franks and Lieb ( 1 982)), which
interfere with the normal switching actions of tubulin. As anaesthetic gases
diffuse into individual nerve cells, their electric dipole properties (which need
have little directly to do with their ordinary chemical properties) can thereby
interrupt the actions ofmicrotubules . This is certainly a plausible way in which
general anaesthetics might operate. Although there seems to be no generally
accepted detailed picture of the actions of anaesthetics, one coherent view
 seems to be that it is indeed the van der Waals interactions of these substances
with the comformational dynamics of brain proteins that are responsible. It is
a strong possibility that the relevant proteins are the tubulin dimers in
neuronal microtubules-and that it is the consequent interruption of the
functioning of microtubules that results in the loss of consciousness.
    As support for suggestions that it is the cytoskeleton that is directly affected
 by general anaesthetics, it may be remarked that it is not only the 'higher
 animals' such as mammals or birds that are rendered immobile by these
 substances. A paramecium, an amoeba, or even green slime mould (as was
noticed by Claude Bernard as early as 1 875) is similarly affected by
 anaesthetics at about the same kind of concentration. Whether it is on the
 paramecium's cilia or its centriole that the anaesthetic exerts its immobilizing
 effect, it seems that it must be on some part ofits cytoskeleton. If we may take it
 that the controlling system of such a one-celled animal is indeed its
 cytoskeleton, then a consistent picture is obtained if we take it that it is on the
 cytoskeleton that general anaesthetics indeed act.
    This is not to say that such one-celled animals need be considered to be
 conscious. That is a separate matter altogether. For there may well be a great
 deal, in addition to properly functioning cytoskeletons, that is needed to evoke
 a conscious state. What does seem to be strongly indicated, however, on the
 basis of such arguments as have been indicated here, is that our state (or states)
 of consciousness require such a functioning cytoskeleton. Without a properly
 operating system of cytoskeletons, consciousness is removed, being instantly
 knocked out as soon as the functioning of the cytoskeletons is inhibited-and
                          Quantum theory and the brain                        3 71


it instantly returns as soon as this functioning is restored, so long as there has
been no other damage incurred in the meanwhile. The question is significantly
raised, of course, as to whether a paramecium-or, indeed, an individual
human liver cell-might actually possess some rudimentary form of
consciousness, but this question is not answered by such considerations . On
any account, it must also be the case that the detailed neural organization of
the brain is fundamentally involved in governing whatform that consciousness
must take. Moreover, if that organization were not important, then our livers
would evoke as much consciousness as do our brains. Nevertheless, what the
preceding arguments strongly suggest is that it is not just the neuronal
organization of our brains that is important. The cytoskeletal underpinnings
of those very neurons seem to be essential for consciousness to be present.
    Presumably, for consciousness to arise generally, it is not a cytoskeleton as
such that is relevant, but some essential physical action that biology has so
cleverly contrived to incorporate into the activity of its microtubules. What is
this essential physical action? The thrust of the arguments of Part I of this
book has been that we need something that is beyond computational
simulation if we are to find a physical basis for conscious acts. The arguments
of Part II, in the chapters preceding this one, have told us to look to the
borderline between the quantum and classical levels, where present-day
physics tells us to use the stop-gap procedure R, but where I am claiming a new
physical theory of OR is needed. In the present chapter, we tried to pinpoint
the place in the brain where quantum action might be important to classical
behaviour, and have apparently been driven to consider that it is through the
cytoskeletal control of synaptic connections that this quantum/classical
interface exerts its fundamental influence on the brain's behaviour. Let us try
to explore this picture a little more fully.


                      7.7 A model for a mind ?
As was remarked in §7 . 1 , it seems appropriate to accept that nerve signals
themselves are things that can be treated in a completely classical way-in
view of the probable fact that such signals disturb their environment to an
extent that quantum coherence cannot be maintained at that stage. If the
synaptic connections and their strengths are kept fixed, then the way in which
each neuron's firing affects the next one will again be something that can be
treated classically, apart from a random ingredient that comes in at this stage.
The action of the brain in such circumstances would be entirely computa­
tional, in the sense that a computational simulation would in principle be
possible. By this, I do not mean that such a simulation would imitate precisely
the actions of a specific brain that was wired up in this way-because of these
random ingredients-but that it would provide a simulation of a typical action
of that brain and therefore of a typical behaviour of some individual controlled
by such a brain (cf. § 1 .7). Moreover, this is very much an in principle
3 72                       Quantum theory and the brain


statement . There is no suggestion that with present-day technology such a
simulation could actually be carried out. I am also assuming, in this, that the
random ingredients are genuinely random . The possibility of a dualistic
external 'mind' coming in to influence these probabilities is not under
consideration here (cf. §7. 1 ).
    Thus we are accepting (provisionally, at least) that, with fixed synaptic
connections, the brain is indeed acting as some kind of computer-albeit a
computer with built-in random ingredients. As we have seen from the
arguments of Part I, it is exceedingly improbable that such a scheme could ever
provide a model for human conscious understanding. On the other hand, if the
specific synaptic connections that define the particular neural computer under
consideration are subject to continual change, where the control of those
changes is governed by some non-computational action, then it remains
possible that such an extended model could indeed simulate the behaviour of a
conscious brain.
    What non-computational action could this be? In this connection, we
should bear in mind the global nature of consciousness. If it were merely the
case that some 101 1 individual cytoskeletons were each separately supplying
some non-computational input, it is hard to see that this would be of much use
to us. According to the arguments of Part I, the non-computational behaviour
is indeed linked to the action of consciousness-at least to the extent that some
conscious actions, specifically the quality of understanding, are argued to be
non-computational. But this is not something relevant to individual
cytoskeletons or to individual microtubules within a cytoskeleton. There can
be no suggestion that any particular cytoskeleton or microtubule 'under­
stands' any part of the Godel argument ! The understanding is something that
operates at a much more global scale; and if cytoskeletons are involved, then it
must be some collective phenomenon which concerns very large numbers of
cytoskeletons all at once.
    Recall Frohlich's idea that large-scale collective quantum phenomenon­
perhaps of the nature of a Bose-Einstein condensate--i s a definite biological
possibility, even within the 'hot' brain (cf. also Marshall 1989). Here we
envisage that not only must single microtubules be involved in a relatively
large-scale quantum-coherent state, but that such a state must extend from
one microtubule to the next. Thus, not only must this quantum coherence
stretch to the length of an entire microtubule (and we recall that microtubules
can extend to considerable length), but a good many of the different
microtubules in the cytoskeleton within a neuron, if not all of them, must
together take part in this same quantum-coherent state. Not only this, but the
quantum coherence must leap the synaptic barrier between neuron and
neuron. It is not much of a globality if it involves only individual cells ! The
 unity of a single mind can arise, in such a description, only if there is some form
 of quantum coherence extending across at least an appreciable part of the
entire brain.

   Such a feat would be a remarkable one-almost an incredible one-for
Nature to achieve by biological means. Yet I believe that the indications must
be that she has done so, the main evidence coming from the fact of our own
mentality. There is much to be understood about biological systems and how
they achieve their magic. There is much, in biology, that surpasses by far what
can be done with present-day direct physical techniques. (Think, for example,
of a tiny millimetre-sized spider delicately weaving her elaborate web . ) We
recall, moreover, that certain quantum-coherent effects over a distance of
several metres-the EPR entanglements involved in pairs of photons-have
already been observed (by physical means) in the experiments of Aspect and
others (cf. §5 .4). Despite the technical difficulty of performing experiments
which can detect such large-distance quantum effects, we should not rule out
the possibility of Nature having found biological ways of doing a great deal
more. The 'ingenuity' that is to be found in biology should never be
underestimated.
   However, the arguments I have been presenting require more than just
quantum coherence on a large scale. They require that the biological systems
that are our brains have somehow contrived to harness the details of a physics
that is yet unknown to human physicists ! This physics is the missing OR
theory that straddles the quantum and classical levels and, as I am arguing,
replaces the stop-gap R-procedure by a highly subtle non-computational (but
undoubtedly still mathematical) physical scheme.
   That human physicists are, as yet, largely ignorant of this missing theory is,
of course, no argument against Nature having made use of it in biology. She
took advantage of the principles of Newtonian dynamics long before Newton,
of electromagnetic phenomena long before Maxwell, and of quantum
mechanics long before Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, and
Dirac-by some thousands of millions of years ! It is only the arrogance of our
present age that leads so many to believe that we now know all the basic
principles that can underlie all the subtleties of biological action. When some
organism is blessed with the fortune of stumbling upon such subtle action, it
may reap the benefits that this physical process confers upon it. Then Nature
smiles upon that organism and upon its descendants, and allows that subtle
physical action to be preserved from generation to generation in increasing
numbers-through her powerful process of natural selection.
   When the first eukaryotic cell-creatures emerged, they must have found that
they obtained great benefit from the presence of the primitive microtubules
within them. Some kind of organizational influence arose, according to the
picture that I am presenting here, which perhaps enabled them to behave in
some rudimentary kind of purposeful way, and this helped them to survive
better than their competitors. It would, no doubt, be quite inappropriate to
refer to such an influence as a 'mind'; yet it arose, I suggest, by virtue of some
subtle interplay between quantum-level and classical-level processes. The
subtle nature of this interplay owed its very existence to the sophisticated
3 74                           Quantum theory and the brain


physical OR action-still in detail unknown to us-that, in less subtly
organized circumstances, appears as the crude quantum-mechanical
R-process we now adopt. The distant descendants of these cell-creatures­
today's parameciums and amoebas, and also our ants, trees, frogs, buttercups,
and human beings-have kept the benefits . that this sophisticated action had
conferred upon those ancient cell-creatures and have twisted them to serve
many completely different-looking purposes. Only when incorporated into a
highly developed nervous system has this action finally been able to realize a
good measure of its tremendous potential-and given rise to what we actually
refer to as 'mind' .
   Let us then accept the possibility that the totality of microtubules in the
cytoskeletons of a large family of the neurons in our brains may well take part
in global quantum coherence-or at least that there is sufficient quantum
entanglement between the states of different microtubules across the brain­
so that an overall classical description of the collective actions of these
microtubules is not appropriate. We might envisage complicated 'quantum
oscillations' within microtubules, where the isolation that the tubes them­
selves provide is sufficient to ensure that not all quantum coherence is lost. It is
tempting to suppose that the cellular-automata-like C()mputations that are
envisaged as taking place along the tubes by Hameroff and his colleagues can
be coupled to the presumed quantum oscillations (e.g. those of del Giudice et
al. 1 983 or Jibu et al. 1 994) taking place within the tubes.
   In this connection, it may be remarked that the kind of frequency that
Frohlich had envisaged for his collective quantum oscillations, as supported
by the observations of Grundler and Keilmann ( 1 983 }--namely in the
frequency region of 5 x 1 0 1 0 Hz (that is, 5 x 1 0 1 0 oscillations per second}--i s
the same kind of frequency that is envisaged, by Hameroff and colleagues, as
the 'switching time' for the tubulin dimers in their microtubular cellular
automata. Thus, if Frohlich's mechanism is indeed what is operating within
microtubules, then some kind of coupling between the two kinds of activity is
indeed indicated.*
   I f the coupling between the two were too strong, however, then it would not
be possible to maintain a quantum nature for the internal oscillations without
the computations along the tubes themselves having to be treated quantum­
mechanically. If this were the case, then it would have to be some kind of
quantum computation that is taking place along microtubules (cf. §7. 3 ) ! We
must ask whether this is a serious possibility.
          *It is much less clear, however, whether there can be any direct connection
       between such comparatively high frequencies and the more familiar 'brain-wave'
       activity (such as the 8-12 Hz «-rhythm). It is just conceivable that such lower
       frequencies might arise as 'beat frequencies', but no link has been established. Of
       particular note, in this connection, are recent observations of 35-75 Hz oscillations
       that seemingly appear in association with regions of the brain involved with
       conscious attention. These seem to have some puzzling non-local properties. (See
       Eckhorn et al. 1988, Grey and Singer 1989, Crick and Koch 1990, Crick 1994).
                          Quantum theory and the brain                        3 75

   The difficulty is that this would seem to require that the changes in the dimer
conformations do not significantly disturb the outside ambient material. In
this connection, it should be pointed out that there appears to be a region
surrounding a microtubule of ordered water and where other materials are
excluded (cf. Hameroff 1987, p. 1 72), which might provide some measure of
quantum shielding. On the other hand, there are connecting MAPs (cf. §7.4)
reaching outwards from microtubules, some concerned with their role as
transporters of other materials, and which appear to be influenced by the
movement of the signals along the tubes (cf. Hameroff, p. 1 22). This latter fact
seems to be telling us that the 'computations' that the tube indulges in may
indeed disturb the environment to an extent that they must be treated
classically. The amount of disturbance remains fairly small in terms of mass
movement, according to the OR criterion put forward in §6. 12, but for the
entire system to remain at the quantum level, it would be necessary that these
disturbances do not for long extend outwards into the cell and then outwards
beyond the cell's boundaries. To my own mind, there remains sufficient
uncertainty, both in relation to the actual physical situation and with regard to
how the OR criterion of §6. 1 2 is to be applied, that one cannot be sure whether
or not an entirely classical picture is appropriate at this stage.
   For the purposes of argument, however, let us assume that the microtu­
bules' computations must indeed be treated as essentially classical-in the
sense that we do not consider quantum superpositions of different compu­
tations to be playing a significant role. On the other hand, let us also envisage
that there are genuinely quantum oscillations of some kind taking place within
the tubes, with some kind of delicate coupling between the quantum internal
and classical external aspects of each tube. According to this picture, it would
be in this delicate coupling that the details of the needed new OR theory would
most importantly come into play. There would have to be some influence of
the quantum interior 'oscillations' on the exterior computations that take
place, but that is not unreasonable-in view of the mechanisms that are
envisaged as being responsible for the microtubule's cellular-automata-like
behaviour, namely weak van der Waals' type of influences between
neighbouring tubulin dimers.
   Our picture, then, is of some kind of global quantum state which co�erently
couples the activities taking place within the tubes, concerning microtubules
collectively right across large areas of the brain. There is some influence that
this state (which may not be simply a 'quantum state', in the conventional
sense of the standard quantum formalism) exerts on the computations taking
place along the microtubules-an influence which takes delicate and precise
account of the putative, missing, non-computational OR physics that I have
been strongly arguing for. The 'computational' activity of conformational
changes in the tubulins controls the way that the tubes transport materials
along their outsides (see Fig. 7 . 1 3 ), and ultimately influences the synapse
strengths at pre- and postsynaptic endings. In this way, a little of this coherent

                          move directly along microtubules.



quantum organization within the microtubules is 'tapped off' to influence
changes in the synaptic connections of the neural computer of the moment.
   One might speculate in various ways, in relation to such a picture. There is,
for example, a possible role for the puzzling non-locality of the EPR-type
effects of quantum entanglement. The strange quantum roles of counterfac­
tuals may be playing their part also. Perhaps the neural computer is poised to
enact some computation which it does not actually perform, but (as with the
bomb-testing problem) the mere fact that it might have performed the
computation causes an effect that is different from that which would be
the case if it could not perform it. In this way, the classical 'wiring' of the neural
computer at any one moment could have an influence on the internal
cytoskeletal state, even though the neuron firings that would activate that
particular 'wired-up' computer might not actually take place. One may
contemplate possible analogies with this sort of thing, in many of the familiar
mental activities that we continually indulge in-but I feel that it is better not
to pursue matters of this nature further here !
   On the view that I am tentatively putting forward, consciousness would be
some manifestation of this quantum-entangled internal cytoskeletal state and
of its involvement in the interplay (OR) between quantum and classical levels
of activity. The computer-like classically interconnected system of neurons
would be continually influenced by this cytoskeletal activity, as the
manifestation of whatever it is that we refer to as 'free will'. The role of neurons,
in this picture, is perhaps more like a magnifying device in which the smaller­
scale cytoskeletal action is transferred to something which can influence other
organs of the body-such as muscles. Accordingly, the neuron level of
description that provides the currently fashionable picture of the brain and
mind is a mere shadow of the deeper level of cytoskeletal action-and it is at
this deeper level where we must seek the physical basis of mind !
   There is admittedly speculation involved in this picture, but it is not out of
line with our current scientific understanding. We have seen in the last chapter
                           Quantum theory and the brain                         3 77


that there are powerful reasons, coming from considerations within present­
day physics itself, for expecting that these present physical ideas must be
modified-giving new effects at just such a level that could well be relevant to
microtubules, and perhaps to the cytoskeleton/neuron interface. By the
arguments of Part I, we need an opening for a non-computational physical
action if we are to find a physical home for consciousness, and I have argued in
Part II that the only plausible place for such action is in a cogent replacement
(OR) for the quantum-state-reduction process that I have denoted by R. We
must now address the question of whether there are any purely physical
grounds for believing that OR might indeed be of a non-computational
nature. We shall find that, in keeping with the suggestions that I have put
forward in §6. 1 2, there are indeed some such grounds.



       7.8 Non-computability in quantum gravity : 1
A key requirement in the preceding discussion is that some kind of
non-computability should be a feature of whatever new physics should come
in to replace the probabilistic R-procedure that is used in ordinary quantum
theory. I have argued in §6. 10 that this new physics, OR, should combine the
principles of quantum theory with those of Einstein's general relativity-i.e. it
should be a quantum -gravitational phenomenon. Is there any evidence that
non-computability might be an essential feature of whatever theory eventually
emerges to unify correctly (and modify appropriately) both quantum theory
and general relativity?
   In a particular approach to quantum gravity, Robert Geroch and James
Hartle ( 1986) found themselves confronted with a computationally unsolvable
problem, namely the topological equivalence problem for 4-manifolds. Basi­
cally, their approach involved the question of deciding when two four­
dimensional spaces are 'the same', from the topological point of view (i.e. when
it is possible to deform one of them continuously until it coincides with the
other, where the deformation does not allow tearing or gluing the spaces in
any way). In Fig. 7 . 14, this is illustrated in the two-dimensional case, where we
see that the surface of a teacup is topologically the same as the surface of a ring,
but the surface of a ball is different. In two dimensions, the topological
equivalence problem is computationally solvable, but it was shown by
A. A. Markov in 1958 that there is no algorithm for solving this problem in the
four-dimensional case. In fact, what is shown effectively demonstrates that if
there were such an algorithm, then one could convert that algorithm into
another algorithm which could solve the halting problem, i.e. it could decide
whether or not a Turing-machine action will stop. Since, as we have seen in
 §2.5, there is no such algorithm, it follows that there cannot be any algorithm
for solving the equivalence problem for 4-manifolds either.
   There are many other classes of mathematical problem which are

                                                   � s�

computationally unsolvable. Two of these, Hilbert's tenth problem and the
tiling pro blem, were discussed in §1 .9. For another example, the word
problem (for semigroups), see ENM, pp. 1 30-2.
   It should be made clear that 'computationally unsolvable' does not imply
that there are any problems in the class that are individually insoluble in
principle. It merely asserts that there is no systematic (algorithmic) means of
solving all the problems in the class. In any individual case, it might turn out to
be possible to arrive at a solution by means of human ingenuity and insight,
perhaps aided by computation, It might also happen to be the case that there
are members of the class which are humanly (or machine-aided humanly)
inaccessible. Nothing really seems to be known about this, so one can form
one's own opinion on the matter. However, what the GOdel-Turing-type
argument as given in §2.5, together with the arguments of Chapter 3, does
effectively show is that the problems of such a class that are accessible by
human understanding and insight (aided by computation if you like) form a
class that is itself computationally inaccessible. (In the case of the halting
problem, for example, §2.5 shows that the class of computations that can be
humanly ascertained not to halt cannot be encapsulated by any knowably
sound algorithm A-and the arguments of Chapter 3 take over from there. )
    I n the Geroch-Hartle approach t o quantum gravity, the equivalence
problem for 4-manifolds enters their analysis because, according to the
standard rules of quantum theory, the quantum-gravitational state would
involve superpositions of all possible geometries-here space-time geome-
                           Quantum theory and the brain                         3 79

tries, which are four-dimensional things-with complex weighting factors .
I n order t o understand how t o specify !lUCh superpositions i n some kind of
unique way (i.e. without 'overcounting'), it is necessary to know when two of
these space-times are to be taken to be different and when they are taken to be
the same. The topological equivalence problem thus arises as part of that
decision.
   One may ask : if something of the nature of the Geroch-Hartle approach to
quantum gravity turned out to be physically correct, would that mean that
there would be something essentially non-computable in the evolution of a
physical system? I do not think that the answer to this question is at all clear. It
is not even clear to me that the computational unsolvability of the topological
equivalence need make the more complete geometrical equivalence problem
also unsolvable. It is also unclear how (and if) their approach might relate to
the OR ideas that I have been arguing for here, where an actual change in the
structure of quantum theory is expected at the very stage when gravitational
effects become involved . Nevertheless, the Geroch-Hartle work does indicate
the clear possibility that non-computability may have a genuine role in
whatever quantum gravity theory finally emerges as being physically correct.



            7.9 Oracle machines and physical laws
                                                       ..



All this notwithstanding, one may ask a separate question : suppose that the
emergent quantum gravity theory indeed turns out to be a non-computational
theory, in the specific sense that it would enable a physical device to be
constructed which could solve the halting problem. Would this be sufficient to
resolve all the problems that arose from our considerations of the
GOdel-Turing argument in Part I? Surprisingly the answer to this question is
no !
   Let us try to see why an ability to solve the halting problem will not help. In
1 939, Turing introduced an important concept of relevance to this issue, which
he referred to as an oracle. The idea of an oracle was that it would be
something (presumably a fictional thing, in his mind, that need not be
physically constructable) which could indeed solve the halting problem. Thus,
if we present the oracle with a pair of natural numbers q, n, then it would, after
some finite time, give us the answer YES or NO, depending upon whether the
calculation Cq(n ) ultimately stops or does not stop (see §2.5). The arguments
of §2.5 provide us with a proof of Turing's result that no such oracle can be
constructed which works in an entirely computational way, but it does not tell
us that an oracle could not be physically constructed. For that conclusion to
follow, we would need to know that the physical laws are computational in
nature-which issue, after all, is what the discussion of Part II is all about. It
should be pointed out, also, that the physical possibility of constructing an
oracle is not, as far as I can tell, an implication of the viewpoint that I am
380                        Quantum theory and the brain


promoting. As mentioned above, there is no requirement that all halting
problems are accessible to human understanding and insight, so one need not
conclude that a constructable device could do this either.
   Turing, in his discussion of these matters, considered a modification of
computability in which such an oracle could be called in at any stage where
desired. Thus, an oracle machine (which enacts an oracle algorithm) would be
like an ordinary Turing machine, except that adjoined to its ordinary
computational operations would be another operation : 'Call in the oracle and
ask it whether Cq(n) stops; when the answer comes back, continue calculating,
making use of that answer.' The oracle can be called in again and again if
needed. Note that an oracle machine is just as much of a deterministic thing as
is an ordinary Turing machine. This illustrates the fact that computability is
not at all the same thing as determinism. It would be just as possible, in
principle, to have a universe that runs deterministically as an oracle machine
as it would to have one that runs deterministically as a Turing machine. (The
'toy universes' that were described in §1 .9 and on p. 1 70 of ENM , would, in
effect, be oracle-machine universes.)
   Might it be the case that our universe actually does run as an oracle
machine? Curiously, the arguments of Part I of this book can be applied
equally well against an oracle-machine model of mathematical understanding
as they were against the Turing-machine model, almost without change. All
we need do, in the discussion of §2.5, is to read 'Cq(n)' as now standing for the
'qth oracle machine applied to the natural number n'. Let us rewrite this as,
say, C�(n). Oracle machines can be (computably) listed just as well as can
ordinary Turing machines. As far as their specification is concerned, the only
additional feature is that one must take note of the stages at which the oracle is
to be brought into the operation, and this presents no new problem. We now
replace the algorithm A (q , n ) of §2.5 with an oracle algorithm A' (q, n ), which we
try to consider represents the totality of means, available to human
understanding and insight, for deciding for sure that the oracle operation
C�(n) does not stop. Following through the arguments, exactly as before, we
conclude:

      �' Human mathematicians are not using a knowably sound oracle
      algorithm in order to ascertain mathematical truth.

From this, we conclude that a physics which works like an oracle machine will
not solve our problems either.
  In fact, the whole process can be repeated again, and applied to 'second­
order oracle machines' which are allowed to call in, when required, a second­
order oracle-which can tell us whether or not an ordinary oracle machine
ever comes to a halt. Just as above, we conclude :

      �" Human mathematicians are not using a knowably sound second­
      order oracle algorithm in order to ascertain mathematical truth .
                           Quantum theory and the brain                          381


I t should b e clear that this process can b e repeated again and again, rather in
the manner of repeated Godelization, as discussed in relation to Q19. For
every recursive (computable) ordinal a, we have a concept of a-order oracle
machine, and we seem to conclude:
      t§a Human mathematicians are not using a knowably sound a-order
      oracle machine in order to ascertain mathematical truth, for any
      computable ordinal a.
The final conclusion of all this is rather alarming. For it suggests that we must
seek a non-computable physical theory that reaches beyond every computable
level of oracle machines (and perhaps beyond).
   No doubt there are readers who believe that the last vestige of credibility of
my argument has disappeared at this stage ! I certainly should not blame any
reader for feeling this way. But this gives no excuse for not coming to terms
with all the arguments that I have given in detail. In particular, the arguments
of Chapters 2 and 3 must all be retraced, with a-order oracle machines
replacing the Turing machines of that discussion. I do not think that the
arguments are affected in any significant way, but I have to confess to
boggling, rather, at the prospect of presenting everything all over again in
these terms. There is another point that should be made, however, and this is
that it need not be the case that human mathematical understanding is in
principle as powerful as any oracle machine at all. As noted above, the
conclusion t§ does not necessarily imply that human insight is powerful
enough, in principle, to solve each instance of the halting problem. Thus, we
need not necessarily conclude that the physical laws that we seek reach, in
principle, beyond every computable level of oracle machine (or even reach the
first order). We need only seek something that is not equivalent to any specific
oracle machine (including also the zeroth-order machines, which are Turing
machines). Physical laws could perhaps lead to something that is just different.



      7. 1 0 Non-computability in quantum gravity : 2
Let us return to the question of quantum gravity. It should be stressed that
there is no accepted theory at present-there is not even an acceptable
candidate. There are, however many different and fascinating proposals.8 The
particular idea that I wish to refer to now has, in common with the
Geroch-Hartle approach, the requirement that quantum superpositions of
different space-times are to be considered. (Many approaches require
superpositions only of three-dimensional spatial geometries, which is a little
different.) The suggestion, due to David Deutsch9, is that one must superpose,
alongside the 'reasonable' space-time geometries in which time behaves fairly
sensibly, 'unreasonable' space-times in which there are closed timelike lines.
Such a space-time is depicted in Fig. 7. 1 5 . A timelike line describes the possible
382                          Quantum theory and the brain




      Fig. 7. 1 5 . With severe enough light-cone tilting in a space-time, closed
                                 timelike lines can occur.



history of a (classical) particle, 'timelike' referring to the fact that the line is
always directed within the local light cone at each of its points, so that the local
absolute speed is not exceeded-as is required by relativity theory (see §4.4).
The significance of a closed timelike line is that one could contemplate an
'observer' who actually has that line as his* own world-line, i.e. as the line that
describes, within the space-time, the history of his own body. Such an
observer would, after a finite passage of his own perceived time, find himself
back in his past (time travel ! ) . The possibility seems to be open to him to do
something to himself (assuming thar'he has some kind of 'free will') that he
never actually experienced, this leading to a contradiction. (Usually such
discussions have him kill his own grandfather before he was bo rn-o r
something else equally alarming.)
   Arguments of this sort provide sufficient reason for not taking seriously
space-times with closed timelike lines as possible models of the actual classical
universe. (Curiously it was Kurt Godel who, in 1 949, first proposed
space-time models with close timelike lines. Godel did not regard the
paradoxical aspects of such space-times as adequate reasons for ruling them
out as cosmological models. For various reasons, we would normally take a
stronger position on this issue these days, but see Thorne ( 1 994). It would have
been interesting to have Godel's reaction to the use that such space-times will
be put to in a moment ! ) Though it indeed seems reasonable to rule out
space-time geometries with closed timelike lines as descriptions of the classical
universe, a case can be made that they should not be ruled out as potential
occurrences that could be involved in a quantum superposition. This, indeed, is
Deutsch's point . Although the contributions of such geometries to the total
state vector may well be utterly minute, their potential presence has (according

        *See Notes to the reader, p. xvi.
                           Quantum theory and the brain                          383


to Deutsch) a startling effect. If we now consider what it means to perform a
quantum computation in such a situation, we apparently come to the
conclusion that non-computable operations can be performed ! This arises from
the fact that in the space-time geometries with closed timelike lines, a Turing­
machine operation can feed on to its own output, running round indefinitely, if
necessary, so that the answer to the question 'does that computation ever stop'
has an actual influence on the final result of the quantum computation.
Deutsch comes to the conclusion that in his quantum gravity scheme,
quantum oracle machines are possible . As far as I can make out, his arguments
would apply just as well to higher-order oracle machines also .
   Of course, many readers may feel that all this should be taken with an
appropriate amount of salt. Indeed, there is no real suggestion that the scheme
provides us with a consistent (or even plausible) theory of quantum gravity.
Nonetheless, the ideas are logical within their own framework and are
suggestively interesting-and it seems quite reasonable to me that when the
appropriate scheme for quantum gravity is eventually found, then some
important vestiges of Deutsch's proposal will indeed survive. In my own view,
as was stressed particularly in §6. 10 and §6. 1 2, the very laws of quantum
theory must become modified (in accordance with OR) when the correct union
between quantum theory and general relativity is found. But I take it as
considerable support for the possibility of a resulting non-computational
action that, in Deutsch's approach, non-computability-even to the degree
that seems to be required for �a-is a feature of his quantum gravity ideas.
   As a final point, it should be remarked that it is precisely the potential tilting
of the light cones in Einstein's general relativity (cf. §4.4) that gives us the non­
computable effects that Deutsch points out. Once the light cones are allowed
to tilt at all, even by the minute amounts that occur with Einstein's theory in
ordinary circumstances, then there is the potential possibility for them to tilt to
such a degree that closed timelike lines will be the result. This potential
possibility need only play a role as a counterfactual, according to quantum
theory, for it to have an actual effect !



             7. 1 1 Time and conscious perceptions
Let us return to the issue of consciousness. It was the particular role that
consciousness played in the perception of mathematical truth, after all, that
has led us along the road to the strange territory in which we now find
ourselves. But clearly there is far more to consciousness than the perception of
mathematics. We followed this particular road only because it seemed possible
to move somewhere along it. No doubt many readers will not much like the
'somewhere' at which we have more or less arrived. However, if we look back
from our new vantage point, we may find that some of our old problems
appear in a new light.

      between space and time-yet no-one would claim that space should 'flow' !




   One of the most striking and immediate features of conscious perception is
the passage of time. It is something so familiar to us that it comes as a shock to
learn that our wonderfully precise theories of the behaviour of the physical
world have had, up to this point, virtually nothing to say about it. Worse than
this, what our best physical theories do say is almost in flat contradiction with
what our perceptions seem to tell us about time.
   According to general relativity, 'time' is merely a particular choice of
coordinate in the description of the location of a space-time event. There is
nothing in the physicists' space-time descriptions that singles out 'time' as
something that 'flows'. Indeed, physicists quite often consider model
space-times in which there is only one space dimension in addition to the
single time dimension; and in such two-dimensional space-times there is
nothing to say which is space and which is time (see Fig. 7 . 1 6) . Yet, no one
would consider space to 'flow' ! It is true that time evolutions are often
considered in physical problems, where one may be concerned with
computing the future from the present state of the system (cf. §4.2). But this is
not at all a necessary procedure, and calculations are normally carried out this
way because one is concerned with modelling, mathematically, our experi­
ences of the world in terms of the 'flowing' time that we seem to experience­
and because we are interested in predicting the future. 1 0 It is our apparent
experiences that tempt us to bias our computational models of the world in
terms of time evolutions (frequently, but not invariably) whilst the physical
laws themselves do not contain such a compelling inbuilt bias.
   In fact it is only the phenomenon of consciousness that requires us to think
in terms of a 'flowing' time at all. According to relativity, one has just a 'static'
four-dimensional space-time, with no 'flowing' about it. The space-time is just
there and time 'flows' no more than does space. It is only consciousness that
seems to need time to flow, so we should not be surprised if the relationship
between consciousness and time is strange in other ways too .
   Indeed, it would be unwise to make too strong an identification between the
                            Quantum theory and the brain                           385


phenomenon of conscious awareness, with its seeming 'flowing' of time, and
the physicists' use of a real-number parameter t to denote what would be
referred to as a 'time coordinate' . In the first place, relativity tells us that there
is no uniqueness about the choice of the parameter t, if it is to apply to the
space-time as a whole. Many different mutually incompatible alternatives are
possible, with nothing particular to choose between one and any other.
Second, it is clear that the precise concept of a 'real number' is not completely
relevant to our conscious perception of the passage of time, if only for the
reason that we have no sensibility of very tiny timescales-say timescales of
even just one hundredth of a second, for example-whereas the physicists'
time scales hold good down to some 1 0 - 2 5 seconds (as is demonstrated by the
accuracy of quantum electrodynamics, the quantum theory of electromagnetic
fields interacting with electrons and other charged particles), or perhaps even
down to the Planck time of 1 0 - 43 seconds. Moreover, the mathematicians'
concept of time as a real number would require that there be no limit of
smallness whatsoever, below which the concept meaningfully applies, whether
or not this concept remains physically relevant at all scales.
   Is it possible to be more specific about the relationship between conscious
experience and the parameter t that physicists use as the 'time' in their physical
descriptions? Can there really be any experimental way to test 'when' a
subjective experience 'actually' takes place, in relation to this physical
parameter? Does it even mean anything, in an objective sense, to say that a
conscious event takes place at any particular time? In fact certain experiments
of definite relevance to this issue have indeed been carried out, but it turns out
that the results are distinctly puzzling, and have almost paradoxical
implications. A description of some of these experiments was given in ENM ,
pp. 439-44, but i t will b e appropriate t o re-examine them here.
   In the mid 1970s, H . H. Kornhuber and his associates (cf. Deeke et al. 1 976)
used electroencephalograms (EEGs) in order to record electrical signals at a
number of points on the heads of several human volunteers, in order to try to
time any brain activity that might be associated with an act of free will (the
active aspect of consciousness). They were asked to flex an index finger, at
various times, but to do this suddenly at moments that were entirely of their
own choosing in the hope that the brain activity involved with 'willing' this
finger movement could be timed. Significant signals from the EEG traces
could only be obtained by averaging over a number of different runs. What
was found was the surprising result that the recorded electric potential
appeared to build up gradually for something like a second to a second and
one-half, before the actual finger-flexing. Does this mean that a conscious act
of will takes a second or more in order to act? As far as the subject was actually
aware, the decision to flex the finger would have occurred only momentarily
before the finger was flexed, and certainly not as long as a second or so before.
(It should be borne in mind that a 'preprogrammed' reaction time in response
to an external signal is much shorter than this-about one-fifth of a second. )
386                        Quantum theory and the brain


   One appears to conclude from these experiments that : (i) the conscious act
of 'free will' is a pure illusion, having been, in some sense, already
preprogrammed in the preceding unconscious activity of the brain; or (ii) there
is a possible 'last-minute' role for the will, so that it can sometimes (but not
usually) reverse the decision that had been unconsciously building up for a
second or so before ; or (iii) the subject actually consciously wills the finger­
flexing at the earlier time of a second or so before the flexing takes place, but
mistakenly perceives, in a consistent way, that the conscious act occurs at the
much later time, just before the finger is indeed flexed.
   In more recent experiments, Benjamin Libet and his co-workers have
repeated these experiments, but with added refinements designed to time more
directly the actual act of willing the finger-flexing, by asking the subject to note
the positioning of a clock hand at the moment the decision was made (see
Libet 1 990, 1 992). The conclusions seem to confirm the earlier results but also
to tell against (iii), and Libet himself appears to favour (ii).
   In another class of experiments, the timing of sensory (or passive) aspects of
consciousness was investigated, in 1 979, by Libet and Feinstein . They tested
subjects who had consented to having electrodes placed in a part of the brain
concerned with receiving sensory signals from certain points on the skin. In
conjunction with this direct stimulation, there would be occasions when the
corresponding point on the skin would be stimulated. The general conclusion
of these experiments was that it would take something like half a second of
neuronal activity (but with some variation, depending on the circumstances)
before the subjects could become consciously aware of any sensation at all, yet
in the case of the direct skin stimulation, they would have the impression that
they had already been aware of the stimulus at the earlier time when the skin
was actually stimulated .
    Each of these experiments, by itself, would not be paradoxical, although
perhaps somewhat disturbing. Perhaps one's apparent conscious decisions are
really made unconsciously at some earlier time, at least a second before.
 Perhaps one's conscious sensations d o need something like half a second of
brain activity before they can be actually evoked. But if we take these two
findings together, then we seem to be driven to the conclusion that in any
action in which an external stimulus leads to a consciously controlled
 response, a time delay of some one and one-half seconds would seem to be
needed before that response can occur. For awareness would not even take
 place until half a second has passed; and if that awareness is to be put to use,
then the apparently sluggish machinery of free will would then have to be
 brought into play, with perhaps another second's delay.
    Are our conscious responses really that slow? In ordinary conversation, for
 example, this does not seem to be the case. Accepting (ii) would lead one to
 conclude that most acts of response are entirely unconscious, whilst from time
 to time one might be able to override such a response, in about a second, with a
 conscious one. But if the response is usually unconscious, then unless it is as
                           Quantum theory and the brain                         387


slow as a conscious one, there is no chance for consciousness to override it­
otherwise, when the conscious act comes into play, the unconscious response
has already been made and it is now too late for consciousness to affect it !
Thus, unless conscious acts can sometimes be swift, the unconscious response
would itself have to take about a second. In this connection, we recall that a
'preprogrammed' unconscious reaction can occur much more quickly-in
about one-fifth of a second.
   Of course we could still have a rapid unconscious response (of, say, one-fifth
of a second) together with the possibility (i), which could go along with the
total ignoring, by the unconscious response system, of any conscious (sensory)
activity that might come along later. In this case (and the situation with (iii) is
even worse) the only role for our consciousness in reasonably rapid
conversation would be that of a spectator, being aware only of an 'action
replay' of the entire drama.               1
   There is no actual contradiction here . lt is possible that natural selection has
produced consciousness just for its role in deliberate thinking, whilst in any
reasonably rapid activity consciousness is just a passenger. The entire
discussion of Part I, after all, was in relation to the kind of conscious
contemplation (mathematical understanding) that is indeed notoriously slow.
Perhaps the faculty of consciousness has evolved only for the purpose of such
slow and contemplative mental activity, while the more rapid response times
are entirely unconscious in action-yet accompanied by a delayed conscious
perception of them which plays no active role.
   It is certainly true that consciousness comes into its own when it is allowed a
long time to work. But I have to confess to a disbelief in the possibility that
there can be no role for consciousness in such reasonably rapid activities like
ordinary conversation-or in table tennis, squash, or motor racing, for that
matter. lt seems to me that there is at least one profound loophole in the above
discussion, and that is in the assumption that the precise timing of conscious
events actually makes sense. Is there really an 'actual time' at which a
conscious experience does take place, where that particular 'time of
experience' must precede the time of any effect of a 'free-willed response' to that
experience? In view of the anomalous relation that consciousness has to the
very physical notion of time, as was described at the beginning of this section,
it seems to me to be at least possible that there is no such clear-cut 'time' at
which a conscious event must occur. 1 1
   The mildest possibility in accordance with this would be a non-local spread
in time, so that there would j ust be an inherent fuzziness, about the relationship
between conscious experience and physical time. But my own guess would be
that there is something much more subtle and puzzling at work . If
consciousness is a phenomenon which cannot be understood in physical terms
without an essential input from quantum theory, then it might well be the case
that the Z-mysteries of that theory are interfering with our seemingly
watertight conclusions about the causality, non-locality, and counterfac-
388                        Quantum theory and the brain

tuality properties that might actually exist between awareness and free will .
For example, perhaps some kind of role is played by the type of
counterfactuality that occurs with the bomb-testing problem of §5.2 and §5 . 9 :
the mere fact that some act o r thought might b e going to take place, even
though it actually does not, can affect behaviour. (This might invalidate
seemingly logical deductions as in, say, ruling out possibility (ii) as above. )
  I n a general way, one must b e very wary about coming t o seemingly logical
conclusions concerning temporal ordering of events when quantum effects are
involved (as the EPR considerations of the following section will serve to
emphasize). The converse of this is that if, in some manifestation of
consciousness, classical reasoning about the temporal ordering of events leads
us to a contradictory conclusion, then this is a strong indication that quantum
actions are indeed at work !




      7. 1 2 EPR and time : need for a new world-view
There are reasons for being suspicious of our physical notions of time, not j ust
in relation to consciousness, but in relation to physics itself, when quantum
non-locality and counterfactuality are involved. If we take a strongly 'realistic'
view of the state vector It/!) in EPR situations-and I have argued strongly in
§6.3 and §6. 5 about the difficulties in not doing so-then we are presented with
a profound puzzle. Such puzzles lead to genuine difficulties for any detailed
theory of the nature of the GRW theory, described in §6.9, and potentially also
with the OR type of scheme of §6. 1 2, which I am promoting myself.
   Recall the magic dodecahedra of §5.3 and their explanation in §5 . 1 8 . We
ask : which of the following two possibilities represents the 'reality' of things? Is
it my colleague's button-pressing that instantaneously reduces (and disentan­
gles) the original entangled total state-so that the state of the atom in my own
dodecahedron is instantaneously created, disentangled, by his button­
pressing, and it is that reduced state which defines the possibilities that can
result from my own subsequent button-pressing? Or does my own button­
pressing come first, acting on the original entangled state, to reduce the state
instantaneously on the atom in my colleague's dodecahedron, so that it is my
colleague who encounters the reduced disentangled state? It does not matter,
as far as the results are concerned, which way we treat the problem, as was
remarked upon in the discussion of §6.5. It is just as well that it does not
matter, for if it did, then this would violate the principles of Einstein's relativity
in which the notion of 'simultaneity' for distant (spacelike-separated) events
can have no physically observable effects. However, if we believe that I t/! )
represents reality, then this reality i s indeed different i n the two pictures . Some
would regard this as reason enough not to take such a realistic view of l t/1 ) .
Others would accept the other strong reasons i n favour o f the realistic view (cf.
                              Quantum theory and the brain                                   389

§6.3 }-and would be quite prepared to jettison the Einsteinian picture of the
world.
   My own inclinations are to try to hang on to both--quantum realism and
the spirit of the relativistic space-time view. But to do so will require a
fundamental change in our present way of representing physical reality.
Rather than insisting that the way in which we describe a quantum state (or
even space-time itself) must follow the descriptions that are familiar to us now,
we should seek, instead, something that looks very different, though (initially
at least) it would be mathematically equivalent to the familiar descriptions.
   In fact there is a good precedent for this kind of thing. Before Einstein
discovered general relativity, we had become thoroughly used to Newton's
wonderfully accurate theory of gravity in which particles, moving about in a
flat space, attracting each other according to the inverse square law of
gravitational force . One would have thought that introducing any fundamen­
tal change into that picture would be bound to destroy the remarkable
accuracy of Newton's scheme. Yet, such a fundamental change is just what
Einstein did introduce. In his alternative view of gravitational dynamics, the
picture is completely transformed. Space is no longer flat (and it is not even
'space', it is 'space-time'); there is no gravitational force, this being replaced by
the tidal effects of space-time curvature. And particles do not even move,
being represented as 'static' curves drawn on space-time. Was the remarkable
accuracy of Newton's theory destroyed? Not at all; it was even improved
upon, to an extraordinary degree ! (See §4.5.)
   Might we expect that something of a similar kind could occur with quantum
theory? I think that it is extremely likely. It will need a profound change of
viewpoint, which makes it hard to speculate on the specific nature of the
change . Moreover, it will undoubtedly look crazy !
   To end this section, I shall mention two crazy-looking ideas, neither of
which is crazy enough, but each of which has its merits. The first is due to Yakir
Aharonov and Lev Vaidman ( 1 990) and to Costa de Beauregard and Paul
Werbos (1 989). According to this idea, quantum reality is described by two
state vectors, one of which propagates forwards in time from the last
occurrence of R, in the normal way, and the other propagates backwards in
time, from the next occurrence of R in the future. This second state vector*
behaves 'teleologically' in the sense that it is governed by what is going to
happen to it in the future, rather than what happened to it in the past, a feature
that some might feel would be unacceptable. But the implications of the theory
are precisely the same as in standard quantum theory, so it cannot be ruled out
on grounds of this nature. Its advantage over standard quantum theory is that


         *There is some mathematical significance in assigning the backwards-evolving
      state vector a 'bra-vector' <¢1, while the normal forward-evolving one is assigned a
      standard 'ket-vector' II/I>. The pair of state vectors might be represented as a
      product II/I> < ¢1. This is in keeping with the density-matrix notation of §6.4.

                          events by entire Riemann spheres.




it enables one to have a completely objective description of the state in EPR
situations which can be represented in space-time terms consistently with the
spirit of Einstein's relativity. Thus it provides a (kind of) solution to the puzzle
referred to at the beginning of this section-but at the expense of having to
have a teleologically behaving quantum state, which many may find worrying.
(For myself, these teleological aspects of descriptions are perfectly acceptable,
so long as they do not lead to problems with actual physical behaviour.) For
details, I refer the reader to the literature.
   The other idea that I wish to mention is that of twistor theory (see Fig. 7 . 1 7).
This theory was strongly motivated by the same EPR puzzles, but it does not
(as such) so far provide a solution to them. Its strengths lie elsewhere, in
providing unexpected and elegant mathematical descriptions of certain
fundamental physical notions (such as Maxwell's electromagnetic equations,
cf. §4.4 and ENM , pp. 1 84-7, for which it yields an attractive mathematical
formulation). It provides a non-local description of space-time, where entire
light rays are represented as single points. It is this space-time non-locality
that relates it to the quantum non-locality of EPR situations. It is also
fundamentally based on complex numbers and their related geometry, so that
an intimate relationship between the complex numbers of U-quantum theory
and space-time structure is obtained. In particular, the Riemann sphere of
 §5 . 1 0 plays a fundamental role in relation to the light cone of a space-time
point (and to the 'celestial sphere' of an observer at that point). (See David
Peat's (1988) account, for a non-technical description of the relevant ideas, or
the book by Stephen Huggett and Paul Tod ( 1 985) for a relatively brief but
technical one . U)
    It would be inappropriate for me to dwell on these matters further here. I
mention them only to indicate that there are various possibilities for changing
our already extraordinarily accurate picture of the physical world into
something that looks quite different from the pictures that we hold to today.

As an important consistency requirement for such a change, we must be able to
use the new description to reproduce all the successful results of U-quantum
theory (and general relativity as well). But we should also be able to go further
than this, and incorporate the physically appropriate modification of
quantum theory in which the R procedure is replaced by some real physical
process . At least that is my own strong belief; and it is also my present opinion
that this �appropriate modification' must be something along the OR lines of
the ideas described in §6. 12. It should be mentioned that theories in which
relativity is combined with a 'realistic' state reduction, such as the GRW
theory, have so far encountered very severe problems (particularly with regard
to energy conservation. This tends to reinforce my own belief that a
fundamental change in the way that we view the world is needed, before we can
make any profound progress in these central physical issues.
   It is also my own belief that any genuine progress in the physical
understanding of the phenomenon of consciousness will also need-as a
prerequisite-that same fundamental change in our physical world-view.

      be effectively achieved by means of the time-evolution of dynamical equations.)

                          Implications ?




                8 . 1 Intelligent artificial 'devices'
What do we conclude, from the discussions above, is the ultimate potential of
artificial intelligence? The arguments of Part I strongly made the case that the
technology of electronic computer-controlled robots will not provide a way to
the artificial construction of an actually intelligent machine-in the sense of a
machine that understands what it is doing and can act upon that
understanding. Electronic computers have their undoubted importance in
clarifying many of the issues that relate to mental phenomena (perhaps, to a
large extent, by teaching us what genuine mental phenomena are not), in
addition to their being extremely powerful and valuable aids to scientific,
technological, and social progress. Computers, we conclude, do something
very different from what we are doing when we bring our awareness to bear on
some problem.
   However, it should be clear from the later discussions of Part II that I am by
no means arguing that it would be necessarily impossible to build a genuinely
intelligent device, so long as such a device were not a 'machine' in the specific
sense of being computationally controlled. Instead it would have to
incorporate the same kind of physical action that is responsible for evoking
our own awareness. Since we do not yet have any physical theory of that
action, it is certainly premature to speculate on when or whether such a
putative device might be constructed. Nevertheless, its construction can still
be contemplated within the viewpoint rc that I am espousing (cf. § 1 .3), which
allows that mentality can eventually be understood in scientific though non­
computational terms.
   I do not perceive any necessity that such a device be biological in nature. I
perceive no essential dividing line between biology and physics (or between
biology, chemistry, and physics). Biological systems indeed tend to have a
subtlety of organization that far outstrips even the most sophisticated of our
(often very sophisticated) physical creations. But, in a clear sense, these are
still early days in the physical understanding of our universe-particularly in
relation to mental phenomena. Thus, it must be expected that our physical
394                               Implications?


constructions will increase greatly in their sophistication in the future. We may
anticipate that this future sophistication may involve physical effects that can
no more than dimly be perceived at present.
   I see no reason to doubt that, in the more immediate future, some of the
puzzling (Z-mystery) effects of quantum theory will find surprising applica­
tions in appropriate circumstances. Already there are ideas for employing
quantum effects in cryptography to achieve things that no classical device can.
In particular, there are theoretical proposals, depending essentially upon
quantum effects (cf. C. Bennett et al. 1 983), whereby secret information may
be sent from one person to another in such a way that it is not possible for a
third party to eavesdrop without being detected. Experimental devices have
already been constructed based on these ideas, and it is by no means out of the
question that they will find commercial applicability within a few years.
Numerous other schemes have been put forward within the general area of
cryptography which make use of quantum effects, and the embryonic subject
of quantum cryptography is now developing rapidly. Moreover, someday it
may perhaps become possible actually to build a quantum computer, but at the
moment these theoretical constructs are very far from practical realization,
and it is hard to predict when-or even whether-they might eventually be
physically constructed.
   It is even harder to preduct the possibility (or the timescale) for building a
device whose action depends on a physical theory that we do not even know at
present. Such a theory would be needed, I am claiming, before we could
understand the physics underlying a non-computably acting device-'non­
computably', that is, in the Turing-machine-inaccessible sense that I have been
using in this book. According to my own arguments, in order to build such a
device we should first need to find the appropriate physical (OR) theory of
quantum-state reduction-and it is very hard to know how far we are from
such a theory-before we could begin to contemplate its c onstruction. It is
also possible that the specific nature of that OR theory might itself provide an
unexpected complexion on the very task at hand.
   At least, I suppose that we should need to find the theory first, if we are to
construct such a non-computational device. But conceivably not : in actual
practice, it has often been the case that surprising new physical effects have
been discovered many years before their theoretical explanation. A good
example was superconductivity, which was originally observed experimen­
tally (by Heike Kammerlingh Onnes in 1 9 1 1 ) nearly 50 years before the full
quantum-theoretic explanation was eventually found, by Bardeen, Cooper,
and Schrieffer in 1957. Moreover, high-temperature superconductivity was
discovered in 1 986, cf. Sheng et al. (1 988), also without prior good reason to
believe in it on purely theoretical grounds. (As of early 1 994, there is still no
adequate theoretical explanation for this phenomenon.) On the other hand, in
the case of non-computable activity, it would be hard to see how one could
even tell when a given insentient object is behaving non-computably. The
                                    Implications?                                395


whole concept of computability is very much bound up with theory, rather
than being directly an observational matter. But within some non-computable
theory, there could well be behaviour, characteristic of the non-computational
features of that theory, which could be tested, and which an actual device
might exhibit. My guess is that without first having the theory it would be very
unlikely that non-computational behaviour could be observed or exhibited in
a physically constructed object.
    For the purpose of further argument, let us now try to imagine that we have
the required physical theory-which, as I have argued, should be a non­
computational OR theory of quantum-state reduction-and that we also have
some experimental confirmation of that theory. How then would we proceed
to construct an intelligent device? We could not-just on the basis of this . We
would need yet another breakthrough in theory : that breakthrough which tells
us how consciousness actually comes about as a result of some appropriate
organization, in which non-computational OR effects are being harnessed
appropriately. I, for one, have no idea what kind of a theoretical development
this might be. As with the above examples of superconductivity, one might
again imagine that a device of the required nature could be hit upon partly
accidentally, without there being a proper theory of consciousness. It goes
without saying that this seems very improbable-unless, of course, advantage
is taken of some Darwinian evolution process, so that the intelligence might
eventually arise simply through the direct benefits that this consciousness
confers, without there being any understanding on our part as to how it was
done (which, indeed, is how it happened with us ! ). This could hardly be other
than an extremely lengthy business, especially when one considers how slowly
it takes consciousness to manifest its advantages . The reader may well come to
the conclusion that the much more satisfactory way of constructing intelligent
devices is by adopting the haphazard but remarkably effective and compelling
procedures that we have already been using for millenia !
    O f course none o f this will stop u s from wanting t o know what i t i s that is
really going on in consciousness and intelligence. I want to know too .
Bascially the arguments of this book are making the point that what is not
going on is solely a great deal of computational activity-as is commonly
believed these days-and what is going on will have no chance of being
properly understood until we have a much more profound appreciation of the
very nature of matter, time, space, and the laws that govern them. We shall
need also to have much better knowledge of the detailed physiology of brains,
particularly at the very tiny levels that have received little attention until
recent years. We shall need to know more about the circumstances under
which consciousness arises or disappears, about the curious matter of its
timing, of what it is used for, and what are the specific advantages of its
possession-in addition to many other issues where objective testing is
possible. It is a very broad field indeed, in which progress in many different
directions is surely to be anticipated.

       8.2 Things that computers do well-or badly
Even if it is accepted that the present concept of a computer will not achieve
any actual intelligence or awareness, we are still presented with the
extraordinary power that modern computers possess, and with the potential
prospect for an absolutely enormous increase in this power in the future (cf.
§ 1 .2, § 1 . 1 0 and Moravec 1988). Although these machines will not understand
the things they are doing, they will do them almost incredibly fast and
accurately. Will such activity-although still mindless-be able to achieve
things that we use our minds for, perhaps more effectively than we can? Can
we get any feeling for the kinds of things that computer systems will become
very good at, or that minds may always remain better at?
    Already, computers can play chess extraordinarily well-approaching the
level of the very best human grandmasters. At draughts (which, to US readers,
is the game of checkers), the computer Chinook has proved itself superior to
all but the supreme champion Marion Tinsley. However, with the ancient
oriental game of go, computers seem to have got almost nowhere. When such
games are required to be played very fast, this is a factor in the computer's
favour; whereas being allowed a lot of time is to the human player's advantage .
Chess problems two or three moves deep can be solved almost instantly by a
computer, no matter how hard a human may find the problem. On the other
hand, a problem with a simple idea but requiring, say 50 or 1 00 moves, might
defeat the computer completely, whereas the experienced human solver might
not encounter too much difficulty; cf. also §1 . 1 5 , Fig. 1 .7 .
    These differences can b e largely understood i n terms o f certain distinctions
between what computers and humans are good at. The computer just
performs calculations without any understanding of what it is doing­
although it employs certain of the understandings of its programmers. It can
contain a great deal of stored knowledge, whereas a human player can do this
also. The computer can make extremely rapid and accurate repeated
applications of the programmers' understandings in an entirely mindless way,
but it does this to a degree which far outstrips the ability of any human being.
The human player needs to keep reapplying judgements and forming
meaningful plans, with an overall understanding of what the game is all about.
 These are qualities that are not available to the computer at all, but to a large
 extent, it can use its computational power to offset its lack of actual
 understanding.
     Suppose that the number of possibilities per move that the computer need
consider is p, on the average; then for a depth of m moves, there would be
 about pm alternatives for it to consider. If the calculation of each alternative
 takes a time t on the average, say, then we have something like

                                    T= t x pm

for the total time T needed to calculate to that depth. In draughts, the number
                                   Implications?                               397


p is not very large, say about four, which enables the computer to calculate to a
considerable depth in the available time, in fact to about 20 moves (m = 20),
whereas with the game of go we might have something like p = 200, so a
comparable computer system could probably manage no more than five
(m = 5 ) moves or so. The case of chess is somewhat intermediate. Now, we
must bear in mind that the human being's judgements and understandings
would be much slower things than those of the computer (large t for the
human, small t for the computer) but that these judgements could cut down
the effective number p very considerably (small effective p for the human, large
p for the computer), because only a small number of the available alternatives
would be judged by the human player to be worthy of consideration.
   It follows, in a general way, that games for which p is large, but can
effectively be cut down significantly by the use of understanding and
judgement, are relatively to the advantage of the human player. For, given a
reasonably large T, the human act of reducing the 'effective p' makes much
more difference in achieving a large m in the formula T = t x pm than does
making the time t very small (which is what computers are good at). But for a
small T, it is making t very small that can be more effective (since the m-values
of relevance are likely to be small). These facts are simple consequences of the
'exponential' form of the expression T = t x pm.
   This consideration is a little crude, but I believe that the essential point is
reasonably clear-cut. (If you are a non-mathematical reader, and you wish to
get a feeling for the behaviour of t x pm, just try a few examples of values t, p,
and m.) It is not worth going into a great deal of further detail here, but one
point of clarification may be helpful. It might be argued that 'large calculation
depth' as measured by 'm' is not really what the human player strives for. But in
effect it is. When the human player judges the value of a position at a level a few
moves deep, and then considers that it is not helpful to calculate further, this is
an effective calculation to a much greater depth, since the human j udgement
encapsulates the probable effect of continued moves. In any case, on the rough
basis of considerations of this kind, it is possible to obtain some understanding
of why it is much harder to make computers play good go than good draughts,
why computers are good at short but not long chess problems, and why they
have a relative advantage with short time limits for play.
   These arguments are not particularly sophisticated, but the essential point
is that the quality of human judgement, which is based on human
understanding, is an essential thing that the computers lack, and this is
generally supported by the above remarks-as it is supported also by the
considerations of the chess position of Fig. 1 .7 in § 1 . 1 5 . Conscious
understanding is a comparatively slow process, but it can cut down
considerably the number of alternatives that need to be seriously considered,
and thereby greatly increase the effective depth of calculation. (The
alternatives need not even be tried, beyond a certain point. ) In fact, it seems to
me that if one considers what computers might achieve in the future, one good
398                              Implications?


guide to the answer would be obtained if one asks the question 'is actual
understanding needed in the performance of the task?' Many things in our
daily lives do not need much understanding in order to perform them, and it is
quite possible that computer-controlled robots will get very good at such
things. Already there are machines controlled by artificial neural networks
that perform very creditably in tasks of this kind. For example, they can do
reasonably well with recognizing faces, prospecting for minerals, recognizing
faults in machinery by distinguishing different sounds, checking up on credit­
card fraud, etc. 1 In a general way, where these methods are successful, the
abilities of these machines approach, or sometimes might somewhat exceed,
those of average human experts. But with such bottom-up programming, we
do not see the kind of powerful machine 'expertise' that occurs with top-down
systems, say with chess computers, or-even more impressively-with
straightforward numerical calculation, where the best human calculators
come nowhere close to what can be achieved by electronic computers . In the
case of tasks that are effectively dealt with by (bottom-up) artificial neural
network systems, it is probably fair to say that there is not a great deal of
understanding involved in the way the humans perform these tasks any more
than there is in the way that the computer does it, and some limited degree of
success on the part of computers is to be expected. Where there is a good deal
of specific top-down organization in the computer's programming, as there is
with numerical calculation, chess computers, or computing for scientific
purposes, then the computers can become very powerfully effective. In these
cases, again the computer does not need any actual understanding on its own
part, but now because the relevant understanding has been provided by the
human programmers (see § 1 .2 1 ).
   It should also be mentioned that, very frequently, computer errors occur in
top-down systems-because the programmer has made a mistake. But that is
a result of human error, which is another matter altogether. Automatic error­
correcting systems can be introduced-and these have their value-but errors
which are too subtle cannot be caught in this way.
                                 '
   The kind of situation in which it might be dangerous to put too much faith in
an entirely computer-controlled system is when the system can carry on for a
long time performing reasonably well, and perhaps even giving people the
impression that it is understanding what it is doing. Then, unexpectedly, it
might do something that appears completely crazy, revealing that it never
really had any understanding at all (as was the case with Deep Thought's
failure, with the chess position of Fig. 1 .7). Thus, one should always be on
one's guard. Armed with the realization that 'understanding' is simply not a
computational quality, we can proceed in the knowledge that there is no
 possibility of a purely computer-controlled robot possessing any of that
 quality.
   Of course, human beings themselves differ very much with regard to their
 own possession of the quality of understanding. And, as with computers, it is
                                    Implications?                                  399


quite possible for a human to give the impression that understanding is present
when it is not. There is something of a trade-off between genuine
understanding on the one hand, and memory and calculational powers on the
other. Computers are capable of the latter but not of the former. As is very
familiar to teachers at all levels (but not, alas, always familiar to governments)
it is the quality of understanding which is by far the more valuable. It is this
quality, rather than the mere parroting of rules or information, that one wishes
to encourage in one's pupils. Indeed, it is one of the skills in the construction of
examination questions (as is particularly the case in mathematics) that they
should test the candidate's understanding, as distinct merely from memory
and calculational powers-though there is indeed value in those other
qualities also.



                            8.3 Aesthetics, etc .
I have concentrated, in the above discussion, on the quality of'understanding'
as something essential that is missing from any purely computational system.
That particular quality was, after all, what featured in the Godel argument of
 §2.5-and whose absence, within the mindlessness of computational action,
revealed the essential limitations of computation, thus spurring us on to try to
find something better. Yet 'understanding' is but one of the qualities for which
conscious awareness is of value to us. More generally, we conscious beings
gain benefit from any circumstance where we can directly 'feel' things; and this,
I am arguing, is just what a purely computational system can never achieve.
   We may well ask : in what way is a computer-controlled robot disadvantaged
by its inability to feel, so that it could not appreciate, say, the beauty of a starlit
sky, or the magnificent splendour of the Taj Mahal in a still evening, or the
magical complexities of a Bach fugue-or even the stark beauty of the
Pythagorean theorem? We could simply say that it is the robot's loss that it
cannot feel what we are capable of feeling when confronted by such
manifestations of quality. Yet there is more to the matter than this. We might
ask a different question. Accepting that the robot is not actually capable of
feeling anything, might not a cleverly programmed computer be nevertheless
capable of producing great works of art?
   This is a delicate question, it seems to me. The short answer, I believe, is
simply 'no'-if only because the computer cannot possess the sensual qualities
that are necessary in order to judge the good from the bad, or the superb from
the merely competent. But, we may ask : why is it necessary for the computer
actually to 'feel', in order for it to develop its own 'aesthetic criteria' and to
form its own judgements? One might imagine that such judgements could
simply 'emerge' after a long period of (bottom-up) training. However, as with
the quality of understanding, I feel that it is much more probable that the
criteria would have to be part of the computer's deliberate input, these criteria
400                                Implications?

having been carefully distilled from a detailed top-down analysis (very
possibly computer aided) that has been carried out by aesthetically sensitive
human beings. Indeed, schemes of this very kind have been put into action by a
number of AI researchers. For example, Christopher Longuet-Higgins, in
work performed at the University of Sussex, has implemented various
computer systems that compose music according to criteria that he has
provided. Even in the eighteenth century, Mozart and his contemporaries
showed how to construct 'musical dice' that could be used to combine known
aesthetically pleasing ingredients with random elements in order to produce
vaguely creditable compositions. Similar devices have been adopted in the
visual arts, such as the 'AARON' system programmed by Harold Cohen,
which can produce numerous 'original' line drawings by invoking random
elements to combine fixed-input ingredients according to certain rules. (See
Margaret Boden's (1 990) book The Creative Computer for many examples of
this kind of 'computer creativity'; also Michie and Johnston ( 1 984).)
   I think that it would be generally accepted that the product of this sort of
activity has not, as yet, been anything that could stand comparison with what
can be achieved by a moderately competent human artist. I feel that it would
not be inappropriate to say that what is lacking, when the computer's input
reaches any significant level, is any 'soul' in the resulting work ! That is to say,
the work expresses nothing because the computer itselffeels nothing.
   Of course, from time to time, such a randomly generated computer­
produced work might, simply by chance, have genuine artistic merit. (This is
related to the old matter of generating the play Hamlet by typing letters
entirely at random. ) Indeed, it must be admitted, in this context, that Nature
herself is capable of producing many works of art by random means, as in the
beauty of rock formations or the stars in the sky. But without the ability tofeel
that beauty, there is no means of distinguishing what is beautiful from what is
ugly . It is in this selection process that an entirely computational system would
show its fundamental limitations.
   Again, one could envisage that computational criteria could be fed in to the
computer by a human being, and these might work fairly well, so long as it is
just a matter of generating large numbers of examples of the same sort of thing
(as one might imagine could be done with run-of-the-mill popular art}-until
the products of this activity become boring, and something new is needed. At
that point, some genuine aesthetic judgements would be required, in order to
perceive which 'new idea' has artistic merit and which has not.
   Thus, in addition to the quality of understanding, there are other qualities
that will always be lacking in any entirely computational system, such as
aesthetic qualities . To these must be added, it seems to me, other kinds of
things that require our awareness, such as mora/judgements. We have seen in
Part I that the judgement of what is or is not true cannot be reduced to pure
computation. The same (perhaps more obviously) applies to the beautiful, or
to the good. These are matters which require awareness and are thus
                                     Implications?                                   401

inaccessible to entirely computer-controlled robots. There must always be a
continuing controlling input from a sensitive, outside, conscious­
presumably human-presence.
   Irrespective of their non-computational nature we may ask : are the qualities
of 'beauty' and 'goodness' absolute ones, in the Platonic sense in which the
term 'absolute' is applied to truth-especially to mathematical truth? Plato
himself argued in favour of such a standpoint. Might it be the case that our
awareness is somehow able to make contact with such absolutes, and it is this
that gives consciousness its essential strength? Perhaps there might be some
clue, here, as to what our consciousness actually 'is' and what it is 'for'. Does
awareness play some kind of role as a 'bridge' to a world of Platonic absolutes?
These issues will be touched upon again in the final section of this book .
   The question of the absolute nature of morality is relevant to the legal issues
of § 1 . 1 1 . There is relevance, also, to the question of 'free will', as was raised at
the end of § 1 . 1 1 : might there be something that is beyond our inheritance,
beyond environmental factors, and beyond chance influences-a separate
'self' that has a profound role in c � ntrolling our actions? I believe that we are
very far from an answer to this question. As far as the arguments of this book
go, all that I could claim with any confidence would be that whatever is indeed
involved must lie in principle beyond the capabilities of those devices that we
presently call 'computers'.



  8.4 Some dangers inherent in computer technology
With any broad-ranging technology, there are likely to be dangers as well as
benefits. Thus, in addition to the evident advantages that computers provide,
there are also many potential threats to our society that are inherent in the
rapid advance of this particular technology. One of the main problems would
seem to be the extraordinary interconnected complication that computers
present us with, so that there is no chance that any individual human being can
comprehend their implications in totality. It is not just a matter of computer
technology, but also of the almost instantaneous global communication that
links computers to each other almost completely around the planet. We see
something of the problems that can arise in the unstable way that the stock
market behaves, where transactions are performed virtually instantaneously
on the basis of world-wide computer predictions. Here, perhaps, the problem
may be not so much the individual's lack of understanding of the
interconnected system as a whole, but an instability (not to mention
unfairness) inherent in a system which is geared to enabling individuals to
make instantaneous fortunes simply by outcomputing or outguessing their
competitors. But it is very likely that other instabilities and potential dangers
may well arise simply because of the sheer complication of the interconnected
system as a whole.
402                                Implications?


    I suspect that some people might believe that it may not be so serious a
problem if, in the future, the interconnected system gets so complicated that it
is beyond human comprehension. Such people might have faith in the
prospect that eventually the computers themselves would acquire the
necessary understanding of the system. But we have seen that understanding is
not a quality that computers are even capable of, so there can be no chance of
genuine relief from that quarter.
    There are additional problems of a different kind which result merely from
the fact that advances in technology are very rapid, so that a computer system
can become 'out of date' soon after it has appeared on the market. The
resulting requirements of continual updating, and of having to use systems
that are often not adequately tested because of competition pressures, must
surely get even worse in the future.
    The profound problems that we are just beginning to face in the new
technology of the computer-aided world, and the rapidity of the pace of
change, are all too numerous, and it would be foolish for me to attempt to
summarize them here. Issues such as personal privacy, industrial espionage,
and computer sabotage are among the things that come to mind. Another
alarming po s sibility for the future is the ability to 'forge' an image of a person,
so that this image could be presented on a television screen expressing views
that the actual individual would have no wish to express. 2 There are also social
issues that are not so specifically computer matters but which are computer
related, such as the fact that, because of the wonderfully accurate powers of
reproduction of musical sound, or visual images, the expertise of a very small
number of most popular performers can be propagated world-wide, perhaps
to the detriment of those who are not so favoured. With 'expert systems' where
the expertise and understanding of a small number of individuals-in, say, the
legal or medical profession-can be put into a computer software package,
perhaps to the detriment of the local lawyers or doctors, we encounter
something similar. My guess, however, is that the local understanding that a
personal involvement provides will mean that such computer-controlled
expert systems will remain aids rather than replacements to local expertise.
    Of course there is an 'upside' for the rest of us in all these developments,
when they can be carried out successfully. For expertise becomes much more
freely available and can be appreciated by a much larger public. Likewise, on
the matter of personal privacy, there are now 'public key' systems (see Gardner
 1 989), which can in principle be used by individuals or by small concerns-just
as effectively as by large ones-and which appear to provide complete security
from eavesdropping. These depend, by their very nature, on the availability of
very fast powerful computers-though their effectiveness depends upon the
computational difficulty of factorizing large numbers-something now
threatened by advances in quantum computation (see §7. 3 ; also Obermayer et
al. ( 1 988a,b) for ideas pointing to a future feasibility of quantum computing).
As mentioned in §8. 1 , there is the possibility of using quantum cryptography
                                  Implications?                               403


as security against eavesdropping-which would also depend for its
effectiveness on significant amounts of computing. Clearly it is no straightfor­
ward matter to assess the benefits and dangers of any new technology, be it
directly computer related or not.
   As a final comment on such computer-social issues, I should like to provide
a little piece of fiction, but which expresses a worry that I have had in relation
to a whole new area of potential problems. I have not heard anyone express
this worry before, but it seems to me to present a new class of possible
computer-related dangers.



                      8.5 The puzzling election
The date of a long-awaited election approaches. Numerous opinion polls are
held over a period of several weeks. To a very consistent degree, the ruling
party trails by three or four percentage points. Expectedly, there are
fluctuations and deviations one way or another from this figur�xpectedly
because the opinion poll figures are based on relatively small samples of
perhaps a few hundred voters at a time, whereas the total population (of many
tens of millions) has considerable variations of opinion from place to place.
Indeed, the margin of error for each of these opinion polls may itself run to that
same 3 or 4 % , so no one of them can really be trusted. Yet the totality of
evidence is more impressive. The polls taken together have a much smaller
margin of error, and the agreement between them seems to have j ust the right
kind of slight variation that would be anticipated on statistical grounds. The
averaged results can perhaps now be trusted to an error of less than 2 % . Some
might argue that there is a slight swing to the ruling party noticeable in these
poll figures on the eve of the actual polling day; and that on the day itself a
small proportion of previously undecided (or even fairly committed) people
may well be finally persuaded to change their votes to the ruling party. Even
so, a swing away from the poll figures towards the ruling party would not do it
much good unless their resulting majority in the votes were perhaps some 8 %
over their nearest rivals, since only then would they achieve the overall
majority that they need in order to stop a coalition between their opponents.
But opinion polls are merely guesses of a sort, are they not? Only the true vote
will express the actual voice of the people, and this will be obtained from the
actual voting figures on polling day.
   Polling day arrives, and passes. The votes are counted, and the result is a
complete surprise to almost everyon�specially to the opinion poll
organizations who had devoted so much of their energies and expertise, not to
mention their reputations, on their previous findings. The ruling party is back
with a comfortable majority, having achieved their target of 8% over their
nearest rivals. A large number of voters are stunned-even horrified. Others,
even though completely surprised, are delighted. Yet the result is false . The
404                                 Implications?

vote-rigging has been achieved by a highly subtle means that has eluded
everyone. There have been no stuffed ballot boxes; and none has been lost,
substituted, or duplicated. The people counting the votes have done their
work conscientiously, and for the most part accurately. Yet the result is
horribly wrong. How has this been achieved, and who is responsible?
   It might be that the entire cabinet of the ruling party is completely ignorant
of what has happened. They need not be the ones directly responsible, though
they are the beneficiaries. There are others behind the scenes who had feared
for their very existence if the ruling party were defeated. They are part of an
organization more trusted (with good reason ! ) by the ruling party than by
their opponents-an organization the strict secrecy of whose undercover
activities the ruling party has been careful to preserve and even extend.
Though the organization is legal, much of their actual activity is not, and they
are not above indulging in illegal acts of political chicanery. Perhaps the
members of the organization have a genuine (but misguided) fear that the
opponents of the ruling party will destroy the country, or even 'sell it out' to
the ideals of foreign powers. Amongst the members of the organization are
experts-experts of extraordinary skill-at the construction of computer
viruses !
   Recall what a computer virus can do. The ones that are most familiar to
people are those that on some appointed day may destroy all the records on
any computer that has become infected with the virus. Perhaps the operator
watches horrified as the very letters on the computer screen drop from their
positions to the bottom and then disappear. Perhaps some obscene message
appears on the screen. In any case, all the data may have become irreparably
lost. Moreover, any disk that has been inserted in the machine and opened will
itself become infected, and will have transferred this infection to the next
machine. Anti-viral programs could in principle be used to destroy such an
infection if spotted, but only if the nature of the virus is known beforehand.
After the virus has struck, nothing can be done.
   Such viruses are normally constructed by amateur hackers, often disgrun­
tled computer programmers who wish to cause mischief, sometimes for
understandable reasons, sometimes not. But these members of our organiza­
tion are not amateurs; they are highly paid, and very expert professionals.
Perhaps many of their activities are 'genuine' ones, entirely in the interests of
their country; yet they also act, under the direction of their immediate
superiors, in less morally excusable ways. Their viruses cannot be spotted by
the standard anti-viral programs, and are preprogrammed to strike on just the
one appointed day-the election day known, for sure, to the leader of the
ruling party and those in the leader's confidence . After the job is done-a job
much more subtle than just to destroy data-the viruses self-destruct, leaving
 no record whatever, bar the evil deed itself, to indicate their previous existence.
    For such a virus to be effective in an election, it is necessary that there should
 be some stage in the vote-counting that is unchecked by humans, either by
                                   Implications?                                 405


hand or by hand calculator. (A virus can infect only a generally programmable
computer.) Perhaps the contents of the individual ballot boxes are correctly
counted; but the results of these counts must be added. How much more
efficient, accurate, and up to date it is to do this adding on a computer­
adding perhaps 100 individual such numbers-than by hand or by hand
calculator ! Surely there is no scope for error. For exactly the same result is
obtained no matter whose computer is used to perform the sum. The members
of the ruling party get just the same results as do those of their principal
opponents, or of any of the other interested parties, or of any neutral observer.
Perhaps they all use different makes or models of computer systems, but this is
of no real consequence. The experts in our organization will know these
different systems, and have designed a separate virus for each. Though the
construction of each of these different viruses will differ slightly, so that each is
specific to each separate system, their results will be identical, and an
agreement from machine to machine convinces even the most suspicious of
sceptics.
   Though agreement between the machines is exact, the figures are uniformly
wrong. They have been cleverly concocted according to some precise formula,
depending to some extent on the actual votes cast-whence the agreement
between the different machines and vague plausibility of the result-so as to
give the ruling party precisely the majority they need; and though credulity
may be a little strained, the result seemingly must be accepted. It seems that, at
the last minute, a significant number of voters took fright and voted for the
ruling party.
   In the hypothetical situation that I have described in this tale, they did not
and the result was false. Although the inspiration for the story actually arose
from our recent ( 1 992) British election, I must strongly emphasize that the
official system of vote-counting that is adopted in Britain does not allow for
this kind of fraud. All counting stages are done by hand. Whilst it may seem
that this is an outdated and inefficient method, it is important to retain it-or
at least to retain some system where there are clear safeguards against even the
mere suspicion of frauds of this kind.
   In fact, on the positive side, modern computers offer wonderful oppor­
tunities for the employment of voting systems in which the opinion of the
electorate can be much more fairly represented than it is now. This is not the
place to enter into such matters, but the essential point is that it is possible for
each voter to convey much more information than the casting of just a single
vote for a single individual. With a computer-controlled system, this
information could be instantly analysed, so that the result could be known
immediately after all the polls are closed. However, as the above tale shows,
one would have to be extremely wary of such a system unless there are
thorough and manifest checks that would convincingly guard against any kind
of fraud of the general nature of that described above.
   It is not necessarily just in elections that one should be wary; the sabotaging
406                                 Implications?

of a rival's company's accounts, for example, would be another possibility
where a 'computer-virus' technique might be employed. There are many other
ways in which one could envisage that carefully constructed insidious
computer viruses could be put to devastating use. I hope that my tale brings
home the continued necessity of the manifest human overriding of the
apparent, and apparently reliable, authority of computers. It is not just that
computers do not understand anything, but they are extremely prone to
manipulation by those few who do understand the detailed ways in which they
are specifically programmed.



      8.6. The physical phenomenon of consciousness ?
The purpose of Part II of this book has been to search, within scientific
explanation, for some place where subjective experience might find a physical
home. I have argued that this will need an extension of our present-day
scientific understanding. There is not much doubt in my own mind that we
must look to the phenomenon of quantum-state reduction to see where our
present picture of physical reality must indeed be fundamentally changed. For
physics to be able to accommodate something that is as foreign to our current
physical picture as is the phenomenon of consciousness, we must expect a
profound change-one that alters the very underpinnings of our philosophical
viewpoint as to the nature of reality. I shall have some comments to make on
this shortly-in the final section of this book. For now, let us try to ask a
somewhat simpler-sounding question: where might one expect, on the basis of
the arguments that I have been putting forward in these pages, that
consciousness is to be found in the known world?
   I must make clear from the very start that the arguments I have been
presenting have very little to say on the positive side. They say that present­
day computers are not conscious, but they do not have much to say about
when an object would be expected to be conscious. Our experience would tend
to suggest, so far at least, that it is in biological structures that we are likely to
find this phenomenon. At one end of the scale, we have human beings, and the
case is surely clear that whatever consciousness is, it is a phenomenon that we
must assume is normally present in association with wakeful (and probably
also dreaming) human brains.
   What about the other end of the scale? I have been making the case that it is
to the microtubules in the cytoskeleton, rather than neurons, that we must
look for the place where collective (coherent) quantum effects are most likely
to be found-and that without such quantum coherence we shall not find a
sufficient role for the new OR physics that must provide the non­
computational prerequisite for the encompassing of the phenomenon of
consciousness within scientific terms. Yet cytoskeletons are ubiquitous
amongst eukaryiotic cells-the kind of cell that constitutes plants and animals,
                                   Implicaiions?                               407


and also single-celled animals like paramesiums and amoebas, but not
bacteria. Must we expect that some vestige of consciousness is present in a
paramecium? Does a paramecium, in any sense of the word, 'know' what it is
doing? What about individual human cells, perhaps in the brain or perhaps in
the liver? I have no idea whether we shall be forced into accepting such
apparent absurdities when our understanding of the physical nature of
awareness becomes adequate for us to be able to answer such questions. But
there is one thing that I do believe in relation to this problem, and that is that it
is a scientific question that eventually should become answerable, no matter
how far from being able to answer it we may be at present.
   It is sometimes claimed, on general philosophical grounds, that there can be
no way of knowing whether any entity other than oneself might be in
possession of the quality of conscious awareness, let alone whether a
paramecium could possess any vestige of it. To my way of thinking, this is
much too narrow and pessimistic a line to take. One is never concerned, after
all, with matters of absolute certainty, when establishing the presence of some
physical quality in an object. I see no reason why there should not come a stage
at which we can answer questions concerning the possession of conscious
awareness with the same kind of certainty that astronomers have. when they
make assertions about celestial bodies many light years away. It was not so
long ago when people would argue that the material composition of the sun
and stars would never be known, nor would the features of the far side of the
moon. However, the entire moon's surface is now well mapped (surveys from
space) and the composition of the sun is now understood in great detail
(observations of spectral lines in the sun's light and thoroughly detailed
modelling of the physics of its interior). The detailed composition of many
distant stars is also known, to a very good degree. And even the overall
composition of the entire universe in its initial stages is, in a number of
respects, very well understood (see end of §4.5).
   But in the absence of the needed theoretical ideas, judgements with regard to
the possession of consciousness remain, as yet, largely matters of guesswork. i
To express my own guesses on this issue, I find myself believing strongly that,
on this planet, consciousness is not restricted to human beings. In one of the
most deeply moving of David Attenborough's television programmes 3 was an
episode that leaves us hard pressed not to believe that elephants, for example,
not only have strong feelings but that these feelings are not far removed from
those that instil religious belief in human beings. The leader of a herd-a
female, whose sister had died some five years earlier-took the herd on a long
detour to the place of her sister's death, and when they came upon her bones,
the leader picked up her skull with great tenderness, whence the elephants
passed it from one to another, caressing it with their trunks. That elephants
also possess und,erstanding is convincingly, if horrifically, displayed in another
television programme. 4 Films from a helicopter, engaged in what was
generously termed a 'culling' operation, showed clearly the elephants' terror as
408                               Implications?


full knowledge of the impending slaughter of their entire herd was
convincingly portrayed in their frighteningly agonized awful cries.
   There is good evidence, also, for awareness (and self-awareness) in apes, and
I would myself have little doubt that the phenomenon of consciousness is still a
feature of animal life considerably 'lower' than that. For example, in yet
another television programme 5-concerning the extraordinary agility, deter­
mination, and resourcefulness of (some) squirrels-I was particularly struck
by a sequence in which a squirrel realized that by biting through the wire along
which it was crawling it could release the container of nuts suspended at some
horizontal distance away. It is hard to see how this insight could have been
instinctive or any part of the squirrel's previous experience. To appreciate this
positive consequence of its action, the squirrel must have had some
rudimentary understanding of the topology that is involved (compare § 1 . 1 9).
It seems to me that this was an act of genuine imagination on the part of the
squirrel-which surely requires consciousness !
   There would seem to be little doubt that consciousness can be a matter of
degree, and it is not just a matter of it being 'there' or 'not there'. Even in my
own experience, at different times I feel that it is present to a greater or lesser
degree (such as, in a dreaming state, there appears to be a good deal less of it
than in a fully wakeful one).
   How far down, then, are we to go? There is enormous scope for differing
opinions . As for myself, I have always had difficulties in believing that insects
have much or any of this quality after watching another documentary film,
where an insect was portrayed ravenously consuming another insect,
apparently oblivious of the fact that it was itself being eaten by a third.
Nevertheless, as mentioned in § 1 . 1 5 , the behaviour pattern of an ant is
enormously complex and subtle. Need we believe that their wonderfully
effective control systems are unaided by whatever principle it is that give us
our own qualities of understanding? Their controlling neuronal cells have
their own cytoskeletons, and if these cytoskeletons contain microtubules that
are capable of sustaining the quantum-coherent states that I am suggesting
are, at root, necessary for our own awareness, then might they not also be
beneficiaries of this elusive quality? If the microtubules in our brains do
possess the enormous sophistication needed for the maintaining of collective
quantum-coherent activity, then it is difficult to see how natural selection
could have evolved this facility just for us and (some of) our multicellular
cousins. These quantum-coherent states must also have been valuable
structures to the early eukaryotic one-celled animals, although it is quite
possible that the value to them may have been very different from what it is to
us.
   Large-scale quantum coherence does not, in itself, imply consciousness of
course--o therwise superconductors would be conscious ! Yet it is quite
possible that such coherence could be part of what is needed for consciousness.
                                  Implications?                               409


In our own brains there is enormous organization, and since consciousness
appears to be a very global feature of our thinking, it seems that we must look
to some kind of coherence on a much larger scale than the level of single
micro tubules or even single cytoskeletons. There must be significant quantum
entanglements between the states in the separate cytoskeletons of large
numbers of different neurons, so that large areas of the brain would be
involved in some kind of collective quantum state. But much more would be
required than just that. In order that some kind of useful non-computable
action can be involved-which I am taking to be an essential part of
consciousness-it would be necessary that the system can make specific use of
the genuinely non-random (non-computable) aspects of OR. The particular
proposal that I have been promoting in §6. 1 2 gives us at least some idea as to
the scales involved, at which a precise, mathematical non-computable OR
action could begin to have importance.
   Thus, on the basis of considerations that I have been putting forward in this
book, one might anticipate some way of at least guessing a level at which
conscious awareness could begin to be present. Processes that can be
adequately described according to computable (or random) physics would
not, according to my viewpoint, involve consciousness. On the other hand,
even the essential involvement of a precise non-computable OR action would
not, in itself, necessarily imply the presence of consciousness-although, on my
view, it would be a prerequisite for consciousness. Certainly, this is not a very
clear-cut criterion, but it is the best that I can do for the moment. Let us see
how far we can get with it.
   I shall try to develop the picture that arises, based upon the suggestions of
§6. 1 2 as to where the quantum/classical boundary should occur-and also on
the biological speculations of §7 .5-§7. 7, according to which we should find
this boundary having relevance at the internal/external interface of the system
of microtubules in a cell, or system of cells. An essential additional idea is that
if state-vector reduction occurs merely because too much of the environment
becomes entangled with the system under consideration, the OR occurs
effectively as a random process for which the standard F APP arguments
(outlined in §6.6) are adequate, and OR behaves just like R. What is needed is
that this reduction takes place just at the point when the (unknown) non­
computational details of our putative OR theory come into play. Although the
details of this theory are not known, at least we can in principle obtain some
idea of the level at which that theory should begin to become relevant. Thus, in
order for these non-computable aspects of OR to play an imporant role, it
would be necessary that some kind of quantum coherence is maintained until
the coupling only just brings in enough movement of material so that OR acts
before the random environment becomes significantly involved.
   The picture that I am proposing for microtubules is that there are 'quantum­
coherent oscillations' taking place within the tubes, and these are weakly
410                                Implications?

coupled to 'computational cellular-automata-like' activity taking place in the
conformational switchings of tubulin dimers on the tubes. So long as the
quantum oscillations remain isolated, the level would be too low for OR to
take place. However, the coupling would entail that the tubulins also get
involved in the state, and at a certain point OR would be effected. What we
need is that OR comes in before the environment of the microtubules becomes
entangled with the state, because as soon as that happens the non-computable
aspects of OR are lost, and the action is just the random R-process.
    Thus, we can ask whether in a single cell (such as a paramecium, say, or a
human liver cell) the amount of tubulin conformational activity can involve
enough mass movement that the criterion of §6. 1 2 is satisfied, so OR comes
into effect at that stage-as required-or whether there is not enough, and the
OR action is delayed until the environment is disturbed-and the (non­
computational) game is lost. On the face of it, there would seem to be much too
little mass movement in tubulin conformational activity, and the game would
indeed seem to be lost at this level. But with large collections of cells, the
situation would appear to be much more promising.
    Perhaps this picture, as it stands so far, indeed favours a viewpoint in which
the non-computational prerequisite for consciousness can only occur with
large collections of cells, as in the case of a reasonable-sized brain . 6 One should
obviously be very cautious, at this stage, about coming to any clear-cut
conclusions of this kind. Both the physical and the biological sides of the
picture are too crudely formulated for any clear conclusions to be drawn, just
yet, as to the implications of the viewpoint that I am P< � senting. lt is clear that
even with the specific proposals that I have been arguing for here, a great deal
of further research on both the physical and biological sides would be needed
before a clearly reasoned guess can be made as to the place at which
consciousness could enter.
    There are also some other issues that should be considered. How much of
the brain, we may ask, is actually involved in a conscious state? Very likely the
entire brain is not involved. Much of the brain's action indeed appears not to
be conscious. The cerebellum (cf. § 1 . 14), most strikingly, seems to act entirely
unconsciously. It governs the delicate and precise control of our actions-at
times when we are not consciously performing those actions (cf. ENM ,
pp. 379-8 1 , for example). The cerebellum i s indeed, frequently referred t o as
 'just a computer' because of its entirely unconscious activity . It would surely be
instructive to know what essential differences there might be in the cellular or
cytoskeletal organization of the cerebellum, as opposed to that of the
 cerebrum, since it is with the latter structure that consciousness seems to have
 its much closer relationship. It is interesting that simply on the basis of neuron
 count, there is not that much difference between the two, there being perhaps
just twice the number of neurons in the cerebrum as in the cerebellum and
generally many more synaptic connections between individual cells in the
                                          Implications?                                           411


cerebellum (cf. § 1 . 14, Fig. 1 .6). There must indeed b e something more subtle at
work than mere neuron counting.*
   Perhaps, also, there would be something instructive to be gained from a
study of the way in which the unconscious cerebellar control is 'learnt' from a
conscious cerebral one. There could well be a strong similarity, in the case of
the cerebellum's learning procedures, with the way that artificial neural
networks are trained, in accordance with the connectionist philosophy. But
even if so, and even if it is also true that some actions in the cerebrum can be
(partially) understood in this way-as implicit in the connectionist approach
to understanding the visual cortex 7 -there is no reason to expect that the same
need be true of those aspects of cerebral action that are involved in
consciousness. Indeed, as I have strongly argued in Part I of this book, there
must indeed be something very different from connectionism that is concerned
with those higher cognitive functions where consciousness itself comes into
play.


              8.7 Three worlds and three mysteries
I shall try to bring the themes of this work together. The central issue that I
have been attempting to address throughout this book is how the
phenomenon of consciousness can relate to our scientific world-view.
Admittedly, I have not had much to say about the issue of consciousness in
general. Instead, I have concentrated, in Part I, on just one particular mental
quality : conscious understanding, especially mathematical understanding. It is
only with this mental quality that I have been able to make the necessary
strong claim : that it is essentially impossible that such a quality can have arisen
as a feature of mere computational activity nor can computation even
properly simulate it-and I should emphasize that there is no suggestion here
that there is anything special about mathematical as opposed to any other kind
of understanding. The conclusion is that whatever brain activity is responsible
for consciousness (at least in this particular manifestation) it must depend
upon a physics that lies beyond computational simulation. Part II represents
an attempt to find scope, within the framework of science, for a relevant

         *As an outsider to the subject of neuroanatomy, I cannot but be struck by the fact
      that there is an (unexplained?) oddity about cerebral organization that does not
      seem to be shared by the cerebellum. Most of the sensory and motor nerves cross
      over, so that the left side of the cerebrum is mainly concerned with the right side of
      the body, and vice versa. Not only this, but the part of the cerebrum concerned with
      vision is right at the back, whereas the eyes are at the front ; that part concerned with
      the feet is at the top, whereas the feet themselves are at the bottom; that part mainly
      concerned with each ear's hearing is diametricaly opposite to the ear concerned.
      This is not completely a universal feature of the cerebrum, but I cannot help feeling
      that it is not an accident. For the cerebellum is not organized in this way. Could it be
      that consciousness benefits in some way from the nerve signals having to take a long
      route?
412                               Implications?


physical action that might indeed take us beyond the limitations of mere
computation. In order to encapsulate the profound issues that confront us, I
shall phrase things in terms of three different worlds, and the three deep
mysteries that relate each of these worlds to each of the others. The worlds are
somewhat related to those of Popper (cf. Popper and Eccles 1 977), but my
emphasis will be very different.
   The world that we know most directly is the world of our conscious
perceptions, yet it is the world that we know least about in any kind of precise
scientific terms. That world contains happiness and pain and the perception of
colours. It contains our earliest childhood memories and our fear of death. It
contains love, understanding, and the knowledge of numerous facts, as well as
ignorance and revenge. It is a world containing mental images of chairs and
tables, and where smells and sounds and sensations of all kinds intermingle
with our thoughts and our decisions to act.
   There are two other worlds that we are also cognisant of-less directly than
the world of our perceptions-but which we now know quite a lot about. One
of these worlds is the world we call the physical world. It contains actual chairs
and tables, television sets and automobiles, human beings, human brains, and
the actions of neurons. In this world are the sun and the moon and the stars. So
also are clouds, hurricanes, rocks, flowers, and butterflies; and at a deeper
level there are molecules and atoms, electrons and photons, and space-time. It
also contains cytoskeletons and tubulin dimers and superconductors. It is not
at all clear why the world of our perceptions should have anything to do with
the physical world, but apparently it does.
   There is also one other world, though many find difficulty in accepting its
actual existence: it is the Platonic world of mathematical forms. There, we find
the natural numbers 0, 1 , 2, 3, . . . , and the algebra of complex numbers. We
find Lagrange's theorem that every natural number is the sum of four squares.
We find Euclidean geometry's Pythagorean theorem (about the squares on the
sides of a right-angled triangle). There is the statement that for any pair of
natural numbers, a x b b x a. In this same Platonic world is also the fact that
                        =



this last result no longer holds for certain other types of 'number' (such as with
the Grassmann product referred to in §5 . 1 5). This same Platonic world
contains geometries other than the Euclidean one, in which the Pythagorean
theorem fails to hold. It contains infinite numbers and non-computable
numbers and recursive and non-recursive ordinals. There are Turing-machine
actions that never come to a halt as well as oracle machines. In it are many
classes of mathematical problem which are computationally unsolvable, such
as the polyomino tiling problem. Also in this world are Maxwell's
electromagnetic equations as well as Einstein's gravitational equations and
innumerable theoretical space-times that satisfy them-whether physically
realistic or not. There are mathematical simulations of chairs and tables, as
 would be made use of in 'virtual reality', and simulations also of black holes
and hurricanes.

   What right d o w e have t o say that the Platonic world i s actually a 'world',
that can 'exist' in the same kind of sense in which the other two worlds exist? It
may well seem to the reader to be just a rag-bag of abstract concepts that
mathematicians have come up with from time to time. Yet its existence rests on
the profound, timeless, and universal nature of these concepts, and on the fact
that their laws are independent of those who discover them. The rag-bag-if
indeed that is what it is-was not of our creation. The natural numbers were
there before there were human beings, or indeed any other creature here on
earth, and they will remain after all life has perished. It has always been true
that each natural number is the sum offour squares, and it did not have to wait
for Lagrange to conjure this fact into existence. Natural numbers that are so
large that they are beyond the reach of any conceivable computer are still the
sums of four squares, even though there may be no chance of ever finding what
these particular square numbers might be. It will always remain the case that
there is no general computational procedure for deciding whether a Turing­
machine action ever halts, and it always was the case long before Turing came
across his notion of computability.
   Nevertheless, many might still argue that the absolute nature of mathe­
matical truth is no argument for assigning an 'existence' to mathematical
concepts and mathematical truths. (I have sometimes heard it said that
mathematical Platonism is 'out of date'. It is true that Plato himself died some
2340 years ago, but that is hardly a reason ! A more serious objection is the
difficulty that philosophers sometimes have with an entirely abstract world
having any influence on the physical world. This profound issue is indeed part
of one of the mysteries that we shall be addressing in a moment. ) In fact the
reality of mathematical concepts is a much more natural idea for mathemati­
cians than it is for those who have not had the fortune to spend time exploring
the wonders and mysteriousness of that world. However, for the moment, it
will not be necessary for the reader to accept that mathematical concepts truly
form a 'world' with an actual reality comparable with that of the physical
world and the mental world. How one really chooses to view mathematical
concepts will not be too important for us for now. Take 'the Platonic world of
mathematical forms' as merely a figure of speech, if you will, but it will be a
useful phrase for our descriptions here. When we come to consider the three
mysteries that relate these three 'worlds' we shall perhaps begin to see
something of the significance of this phraseology.
   What, then, are the mysteries? These are illustrated in Fig. 8 . 1 . There is the
mystery of why such precise and profoundly mathematical laws play such an
important role in the behaviour of the physical world. Somehow the very
world of physical reality seems almost mysteriously to emerge out of the
Platonic world of mathematics. This is represented by the arrow down on the
right, from the Platonic world to the physical world. Then there is the second
mystery of how it is that perceiving beings can arise from out of the physical
world. How is it that subtly organized material objects can mysteriously

      Fig. 8 . 1 In some way, each of the three worlds, the Platonic mathematical,
      the physical, and the mental, seems mysteriously to 'emerge' from-or at
      least to be intimately related to-a small part of its predecessor (the
                             worlds being taken cyclically).


conjure up mental entities from out of its material substance? This is
represented in Fig. 8 . 1 by the arrow pointing at the bottom, from the physical
to the mental world . Finally, there is the mystery of how it is that mentality is
able seemingly to 'create' mathematical concepts out of some kind of mental
model. These apparently vague, unreliable, and often inappropriate mental
tools, with which our mental world seems to come equipped, appear
nevertheless mysteriously able (at least when they are at their best) to conjure
up abstract mathematical forms, and thereby enable our minds to gain entry,
by understanding, into the Platonic mathematical realm. This is indicated by
the arrow that points upwards on the left, from the mental to the Platonic
world.
   Plato himself had been very much concerned with the first of these arrows
(and also, in his own way, with the third), and he was careful to distinguish
between the perfect mathematical form and its imperfect 'shadow' in the
physical world. Thus a mathematical triangle (or a Euclidean one, as we would
have to be careful to specify today) would have its angles sum to exactly two
right angles, whereas a physical one made of wood, say, to as much precision
as could be mustered, might have angles that summed very closely indeed to
the required amount but would not be perfectly precise. Plato described such
ideas in terms of a parable. He imagined some citizens confined to a cave,
chained so that they could not see the perfect shapes behind them that were
casting shadows in the light of a fire on the part of the cave that they faced. All
that they could directly see would be the imperfect shadows of these shapes,
somewhat distorted by the flickering of the fire. These perfect shapes
represented the mathematical forms, and the shadows, the world of 'physical
reality'.

   Since Plato's day, the underlying role o f mathematics i n the perceived
structure and in the actual behaviour of our physical world has increased
enormously. The esteemed physicist Eugene Wigner delivered a famous
lecture, in 1 960, with the title 'The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics
in the physical sciences' . In this, he expressed something of the amazing
precision and subtle applicability of sophisticated mathematics that physicists
continually and increasingly find in their descriptions of reality.
   To me, the most impressive example of all is Einstein's general relativity.
One not infrequently hears the viewpoint expressed that physicists are merely
noticing patterns, from time to time, where mathematical concepts may
happen to apply quite well to physical behaviour. It would be claimed,
accordingly, that physicists tend to bias their interests in the directions of those
areas where their mathematical descriptions work well, so there is no real
mystery that mathematics is found to work in the descriptions that physicists
use. It seems to me, however, that such a viewpoint is extraordinarily wide of
its mark. It simply provides no explanation of the deep underlying unity that
Einstein's theory, in particular, shows that there is between mathematics and
the workings of the world. When Einstein's theory was first put forward, there
was really no need for it on observational grounds. Newton's gravitational
theory had stood for some 250 years, and had achieved an extraordinary
accuracy, of something like one part in ten million (already an impressive
enough justification for taking seriously a deep mathematical underpinning to
physical reality). An anomaly had been observed in Mercury's motion, but this
certainly did not provide cause to abandon Newton's scheme. Yet Einstein
perceived, from deep physical grounds, that one could do better, if one
changed the very framework of gravitational theory. In the early years after
Einstein's theory was put forward, there were only a few effects that supported
it, and the increase in precision over Newton's scheme was marginal.
However, now, nearly 80 years after the theory was first produced, its overall
precision has grown to something like ten million times greater. Einstein was
not just 'noticing patterns' in the behaviour of physical objects. He was
uncovering a profound mathematical substructure that was already hidden in
the very workings of the world. Moreover, he was not just searching around
for whatever physical phenomenon might best fit a good theory . He found this
precise mathematical relationship in the very structure of space and time-the
most fundamental of physical notions.
   In our other successful theories of basic physical processes, there has always
been an underlying mathematical structure that has not only proved
extraordinarily accurate, but also mathematically sophisticated. (And lest the
reader think that the 'overthrowing' of earlier ideas of physics, such as
Newton's theory, invalidates the appropriateness of those earlier ideas, I
should make clear that this is not so. The older ideas, when they are good
enough, such as those of Galileo and Newton, still survive, and have their
place within the newer scheme.) Moreover, mathematics itself gains much

inspiration of subtle and unexpected kinds from input from the detailed
behaviour of Nature. Quantum theory-whose close relation with subtle
mathematics (e.g. complex numbers) is, I hope, apparent even from the
glimpse into the subject that we have had in these pages-as well as general
relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic equations, have all provided
enormous stimulation for the progress of mathematics. But this is true not
only for relatively recent theories like these . It was at least as true for the more
ancient ones like Newtonian mechanics (yielding the calculus) and the Greek
analysis of the structure of space (giving us the very notion of geometry) . The
extraordinary accuracy of mathematics within physical behaviour (such as the
1 1 - or 1 2-figure accuracy of quantum electrodynamics) has often been
stressed. But there is much more to the mystery than jus! this. There is a very
remarkable depth, subtlety and mathematical fruitfulness in the concepts that
lie latent within physical processes. This is something not so familiar to
people-unless they are directly concerned with the mathematics involved .
    It should be made clear that this mathematical fruitfulness, providing a
valuable stimulus to the actual activities of mathematicians, is not just a
matter of mathematical fashion (though fashion is not without its role to play
also) . Ideas that were developed for the sole purpose of deepening our
understanding of the workings of the physical world have very frequently
provided profound and unexpected insights into mathematical problems that
had already been objects of considerable interest for quite separate reasons.
One of the most striking recent examples of this was the use made of
Yang-Mills-type theories (which had been developed by physicists in their
mathematical explanations of the interactions that hold between sub-atomic
particles), by Oxford's Simon Donaldson ( 1 983), to obtain totally unexpected
properties of four-dimensional manifolds 8-properties that had eluded
understanding for many years previously. Moreover, such mathematical
properties, though often not at all anticipated by humari beings before the
appropriate insights came to light, have lain timelessly within the Platonic
world, as unchangeable truths waiting to be discovered-in accordance with
the skills and insights of those who strive to discover them.
    I hope that I have persuaded the reader of the close and genuine
 relationship--still deeply mysterious-between the Platonic mathematical
 world and the world of physical objects. I hope, also, that the very presence of
this extraordinary relationship will help the Platonic sceptics to take that
 world a little more seriously as a 'world' than they may have been prepared to
 do previously. Indeed, some might well go further than I have been prepared
 to go in this discussion. Perhaps a Platonic reality should be assigned to other
 abstract concepts, not just mathematical ones. Plato himself would have
 insisted that the ideal concept of 'the good' or 'the beautiful' must also be
 attributed a reality (cf. §8.3),just as mathematical concepts must. Personally, I
 am not averse to such a possibility, but it has yet played no important part in
 my deliberations here. Issues of ethics, morality, and aesthetics have had no

significant role i n m y present discussions, but this i s n o reason t o dismiss them
as being not, at root, as 'real' as the ones I have been addressing. Clearly there
are important separate issues to be considered here, but they have not been my
particular concern in this book .9
   Nor, in this book, have I been so very much concerned with the particular
mystery (first arrow, down to the right in Fig. 8 . 1 ) of the puzzling precise
underlying role that the Platonic mathematical world has in the physical
world-but with the other two, which are even less well understood. In Part I,
I have been addressing questions raised mainly b y the third arrow: the mystery
of our very perceptions of mathematical truth ; that is, with the apparent way
in which, through mental contemplation, we seem to be able to 'conj ure up'
those very Platonic mathematical forms. It is as though the perfect forms
might be merely shadows of our imperfect thoughts. To view the Platonic
world in this way-as only a product of our own mentality-would be very
much at variance with Plato's own conceptions. To Plato, the world of perfect
forms is primary, being timeless and independent of ourselves. In the Platonic
view, my third arrow in Fig. 8 . 1 should perhaps be thought of as pointing
downwards instead of upwards: from the world of perfect forms to the world of
our mentality. To think of the mathematical world as being a product of our
modes of thinking would be to take a Kantian view rather than the Platonic
one that I am espousing here.
   Likewise, some might argue for a reversal of the directions of some of my
 other arrows. Perhaps Bishop Berkeley w9uld have preferred my second arrow
to point from the mental world to the physical one, 'physical reality' being, on
this view, a mere shadow of our mental existence. There are some others (the
'nominalists') who would argue for a reversal of my first arrow, the world of
mathematics being a mere reflection of aspects of the world of physical reality.
My own sympathies, as should be evident from this book, would be strongly
against a reversal of these first two arrows, though it may be equally evident
that I am somewhat uncomfortable about directing the third arrow in the
seemingly 'Kantian' orientation that is depicted in Fig. 8 . 1 ! To me the world of
perfect forms is primary (as was Plato's own belief)-its existence being almost
a logical necessity-and both the other two worlds are its shadows.
   Owing to such differing viewpoints about which of the worlds .of Fig. 8 . 1
might be regarded a s primary and which as secondary, I shall recommend
regarding the arrows in a different light. The essential point about the arrows
in Fig. 8 . 1 is not so much their direction but the fact that in each case they
represent a correspondence in which a small region of one world encompasses
the entire next world. With regard to my first arrow, it has often been
remarked to me that by far the greatest part of the world of mathematics (as
judged in terms of the activity of mathematicians) seems to have little if any
relation to actual physical behaviour. Thus, it is but a tiny part of the Platonic
world that can underlie the structure of our physical universe. Likewise, the
second of my arrows expresses the fact that our mental existence emerges from
418                                Implications?

but a minute portion of the physical world-a portion where conditions are
organized in the very precise way needed for consciousness to arise, as in
human brains. In the same way, my third arrow refers to but a tiny part of our
mental activity, namely that which is concerned with absolute and timeless
issues-most particularly, with mathematical truth. For the most part, our
mental lives are concerned with quite other matters !
   There is a seemingly paradoxical aspect to these correspondences, where
each world seems to 'emerge' from but a tiny part of the one which precedes it. I
have drawn Fig. 8 . 1 so as to emphasize this paradox. However, by regarding
the arrows merely as expressing the various correspondences, rather than
asserting any actual 'emergence', I am trying not to prejudge the question as to
which, if any, of the worlds are to be regarded as primary, secondary, or
tertiary.
   Yet, even so, Fig. 8 . 1 reflects another aspect of my opinions or prejudices. I
have depicted things as though it is to be assumed that each entire world is
indeed reflected within a (small) portion of its predecessor. Perhaps my
prejudices are wrong. Perhaps there are aspects of the behaviour of the
physical world that cannot be described in precise mathematical terms;
perhaps there is mental life that is not rooted in physical structures (such as
brains); Perhaps there are mathematical truths that remain, in principle,
inaccessible to human reason and insight. To encompass any of these
alternative possibilities, Fig. 8 . 1 would have to be redrawn, so as to allow for
some or all of these worlds to extend beyond the compass of its preceding
arrow.
   In Part I, I have been much concerned with some of the implications of
Godel's famous incompleteness theorem. Some readers might have been of the
opinion that Godel's theorem indeed tells us that there are parts of the world of
Platonic mathematical truths that lie in principle beyond human understand­
ing and insight. I hope that my arguments have made it clear that this is not the
case . 1 0 The specific mathematical propositions that Godel's ingenious
argument provides are ones which are humanly accessible--provided that
they are constructed from mathematical (formal) systems that have been
already accepted as valid means of assessing mathematical truth. Godel's
argument does not argue in favour of there being inaccessible mathematical
truths. What it does argue for, on the other hand, is that human insight lies
beyond formal argument and beyond computable procedures . Moreover, it
argues powerfully for the very existence of the Platonic mathematical world.
Mathematical truth is not determined arbitrarily by the rules of some 'man­
made' formal system, but has an absolute nature, and lies beyond any such
system of specifiable rules. Support for the Platonic viewpoint (as opposed to
the formalist one) was an important part of Godel's initial motivations . On
the other hand, the arguments from Godel's theorem serve to illustrate the
deeply mysterious nature of our mathematical perceptions. We do not just
                                   Implications?                               419


'calculate', in order to form these perceptions, but something else is profoundly
involved-something that would be impossible without the very conscious
awareness that is, after all, what the world of perceptions is all about.
   Part II has been concerned mainly with questions to do with the second
arrow (though these cannot be properly addressed without some reference to
the first)-whereby the concrete physical world can somehow conjure up the
shadowy phenomenon we refer to as consciousness. How is it that
consciousness can arise from such seemingly unpromising ingredients as
matter, space, and time? We have not come to an answer, but I hope that at
least the reader may be able to appreciate that matter itselfis mysterious, as is
the space-time within whose framework physical theories now operate. We
simply do not know the nature of matter and the laws that govern it, to an
extent that we shall need in order to understand what kind of organization it is,
in the physical world, which gives rise to conscious beings. Moreover, the
more deeply we examine the nature of matter, the more elusive, mysterious,
and mathematical, matter itself appears to be. We might well ask : what is
matter, according to the best theories that science has been able to provide?
The answer comes back in the form of mathematics, not so much as a system of
equations (though equations are important too) but as subtle mathematical
concepts that take a long time to grasp properly.
   If Einstein's general relativity has shown how our very notions of the nature
of space and time have had to shift, and become more mysterious and
mathematical, then it is quantum mechanics that has shown, to an even
greater extent, how our concept of matter has suffered a similar fate. Not just
matter, but our very notions of actuality have become profoundly disturbed.
How is it that the mere counterfactual possibility of something happening-a
thing which does not actually happen-can have a decisive influence upon
what actually does happen? There is something in the mystery of the way that
quantum mechanics operates that at least seems much closer than is classical
physics, to the kind of mystery needed to accommodate mentality within the
world of physical reality. I have no doubt myself that when deeper theories are
at hand, then the place of mind in relation to physical theory will not seem so
incongruous as it does today.
   In §7 .7 and §8.6, I have tried to come to grips with the issue of what physical
circumstances might be appropriate for the phenomenon of consciousness.
Yet, it should be made clear that I do not regard consciousness as merely a
matter of the right amount of coherent mass movement according to some OR
theory of the quantum/classical boundary. As I hope I have made clear, such
things would provide merely the appropriate opening for a non-computable
action within the confines of our present-day physical picture. Genuine
consciousness involves an awareness of an endless variety of qualitatively
different things-such as of the green colour of a leaf, the smell of a rose, the
song of a blackbird, or the soft touch of a eat's fur; also of the passage of time,
420                               Implications?

of emotional states, of worry, of wonder, and of the appreciation of an idea. lt
involves hopes, ideals, and intentions, and the actual willing of innumerable
different bodily movements in order that such intentions may be realized. The
study of neuroanatomy, of neurological disorders, psychiatry, and psychology
has told us much about the detailed relationship between the physical nature
of the brain and our mental conditions. There is no question of our being able
to understand such matters merely in terms of the physics of critical amounts
of coherent mass movement. Yet without such an opening into a new physics,
we shall be stuck within the strait-jacket of an entirely computational physics,
or of a computational cum random physics. Within that strait-jacket, there
can be no scientific role for intentionality and subjective experience. By
breaking loose from it, we have at least the potentiality of such a role.
   Many who might agree with this would argue that there can be no role for
such things within any scientific picture. To those who argue this way, I can
ask only that they be patient, and that they wait to see how science moves in
the future. I believe that there is already an indication, within the mysterious
developments of quantum mechanics, that the concepts of mentality are a little
closer to our understandings of the physical universe than they had been
before-although only a little closer. I would argue that when the necessary
new physical developments come to light, these indications should become a
good deal clearer than that. Science has a long way to develop yet; of that, I am
certain !
   Moreover, the very possibility of a human understanding of such matters
tells us something about the abilities that consciousness confers upon us.
Admittedly there are some, such as Newton or Einstein, or Archimedes,
Galileo, Maxwell, or Dirac-or Darwin, Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt,
Picasso, Bach, Mozart, or Plato, or those great minds who could conceive the
fliad or Hamlet-who seem to have more of this faculty of being able to 'smell'
out truth or beauty than is given to the rest us. But a unity with the workings of
Nature is potentially present within all of us, and is revealed in our very
faculties of conscious comprehension and sensitivity, at whatever level they
may be operating. Every one of our conscious brains is woven from subtle
physical ingredients that somehow enable us to take advantage of the
profound organization of our mathematically underpinned universe-so that
we, in turn, are capable of some kind of direct access, through that Platonic
quality of 'understanding', to the very ways in which our universe behaves at
many different levels.
   These are deep issues, and we are yet very far from explanations. I would
argue that no clear answers will come forward unless the interrelating features
 of all these worlds are seen to come into play. No one of these issues will be
resolved in isolation from the others. I have referred to three worlds and the
mysteries that relate them one to another. No doubt there are not really three
 worlds but one, the true nature of which we do not even glimpse at present.

Jessica and her father emerged from the cave. It was now getting quite dark
and still, and some stars were clearly visible. Jessica said to her father:
   'Daddy, you know, when I look up into the sky, I still find it hard to believe
that the earth really does move-spinning around at all those thousands of
kilometres per hour-even though I think I really know it must be true.'
   She paused, and stood looking up at the sky for some while.
   'Daddy, tell me about the stars . . .'
