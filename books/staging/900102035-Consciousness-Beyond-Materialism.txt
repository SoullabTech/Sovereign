Abstract

The dominant materialist worldview holds that consciousness is a late-stage evolutionary
byproduct, that the universe is entirely governed by immutable physical laws, and that agency and
meaning are illusions emerging from deterministic biological computation. This paper challenges
that framework and proposes an alternative: consciousness is not derivative but foundational.
Perception and decision, rather than time, are the true drivers of cosmic and biological evolution;
and subjectivity is not a mere cognitive distortion but a structural and irreducible feature of reality.
Drawing on both philosophical traditions and recent developments in physics and consciousness
studies, this work develops a unifying perspective in which awareness and the evolution of the
cosmos are inseparable. The aim is not to discredit science, but to extend its scope toward a more
complete picture of being.



Introduction: The Limits of Materialism
Over the past four centuries, the scientific method has provided unprecedented insight into the
mechanisms of nature. Yet in the process, the dominant philosophical position in science —
physicalist materialism — has increasingly reduced reality to matter, mathematical laws, and
random processes. The subjective dimension of experience, along with the possibility that
consciousness may play a fundamental role in nature, has been relegated to the margins as either
an illusion or an emergent anomaly (Dennett, 1991).

This position rests on metaphysical assumptions that are themselves neither observable nor
falsifiable: that matter is ontologically primary, that causality is purely mechanistic, and that
consciousness arises only from sufficiently complex neural computation. Even sympathetic critics
such as Thomas Nagel (2012) have argued that the materialist worldview is incomplete, particularly
in its inability to account for the qualitative, first-person nature of experience — what philosophers
term qualia.

In contrast, the framework developed here argues that consciousness is not an emergent side effect
of matter, but the underlying medium in which matter, time, and evolution unfold. This view
resonates with strands of process philosophy (Whitehead, 1929/1978), certain interpretations of
quantum mechanics (Wigner, 1961), and contemporary theoretical physics questioning the
absoluteness of natural laws (Smolin, 2013; Rovelli, 2018).


Change as the Ontological Primitive

Standard physics treats time as a fundamental parameter, an axis along which change occurs. This
leads to philosophical paradoxes — what gives time its apparent flow, and why should change be
directional at all? Inverting the relationship, we may instead posit that change is ontologically
primary and that time is a conceptual abstraction constructed by perceiving systems to represent
the sequence of changes.

This view finds indirect support in thermodynamics, where the arrow of time is defined by
increasing entropy — itself a statistical description of change — and in certain relational models
of physics where temporal order emerges from interactions rather than pre-existing as a universal
background (Rovelli, 2018). If time is a secondary construct, then the fabric of reality is not a static
spacetime manifold but a dynamic field of interactions, with perception and influence at its core.


Decision as the Quantum of Evolution

In classical Darwinian theory, evolution is explained by random mutation filtered by natural
selection. While effective in describing biological adaptation, this model struggles to address the
emergence of agency and intentionality. At the quantum level, probabilistic events also appear to
require a form of "selection" among possible outcomes, yet physics typically avoids
anthropomorphic language here.

The model proposed here treats decision — the selection among alternatives based on interaction
with an environment — as the fundamental unit of evolution. This concept applies across scales:
an electron’s interaction with a potential field can be described in terms of possible paths and a
realized outcome, while at higher levels of complexity, organisms navigate branching behavioral
options. This resonates with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics (e.g., Cramer, 1986) and
with Whitehead’s (1929/1978) process philosophy, which frames reality as a succession of
experiential “occasions” in which potentiality is resolved into actuality.

If decision-making is intrinsic to all physical systems, then evolution is not limited to biology but
is a universal process of recursive self-organization, driven by information exchange and choice.
Life, in this framework, is not a cosmic accident but a structurally probable outcome of a decision-
making universe.
Consciousness as Fundamental

Materialism typically treats consciousness as emerging only at high levels of complexity, such as
in the human brain. Yet such a view faces the "hard problem" (Chalmers, 1996) of explaining how
qualitative experience could arise from purely quantitative processes. Panpsychism, as defended
by Strawson (2006) and Goff (2019), offers an alternative by treating consciousness as a
fundamental feature of the universe, present in rudimentary form even at the microphysical level.

The framework here goes further, suggesting that consciousness is not merely a property of matter
but the medium through which reality manifests. This does not imply that electrons have
thoughts, but that the capacity to perceive and respond — the minimal form of subjectivity — is
present wherever interactions occur. Complexity amplifies this capacity, but it does not originate
it.


Free Will, Determinism, and the Principle of Precedence

Within the framework of a decision-driven cosmos, determinism and free will are not mutually
exclusive but apply in different temporal domains. The past, once actualized, is deterministic in the
sense that every event can be explained as the necessary consequence of preceding conditions.
Given sufficient information about those prior states, the chain of causality leading to a past event
can be reconstructed in full logical detail. In this retrospective sense, determinism holds.

However, this determinism does not extend seamlessly into the future. The future does not yet exist
as a fixed structure; it is an open field of potential outcomes that only become actual when decisions
are made in the present. While the past constrains the range of possible futures, it does not uniquely
determine them. The present moment is therefore a causal hinge — the point where possibilities
collapse into actuality through acts of selection.

This perspective resonates strongly with Lee Smolin’s principle of precedence (Smolin, 2012),
which proposes that when the universe encounters a situation that has occurred before, it tends to
repeat the outcome, drawing upon a kind of “cosmic memory.” When the situation is genuinely
novel, however, there is no stored precedent to dictate the result, allowing for the emergence of
something new. Over time, each novel outcome becomes part of the precedent set, slowly shaping
the evolving regularities — or “laws” — of the universe.
Under this model, the deterministic nature of the past corresponds to the accumulated weight of
precedents: the patterns established by prior events and decisions. The openness of the future arises
from the inevitable encounter with novelty, where no precedent exists to prescribe the outcome.
Decision-making — whether at the scale of human deliberation or fundamental physical interaction
— becomes the mechanism by which the universe both preserves continuity and generates
innovation.
This structure also parallels aspects of quantum theory, in which the past is fixed in the record of
observed outcomes, while the future exists as a set of probabilities until an event or measurement
selects one. Similarly, Karl Popper’s notion of an “open future” (Popper, 1982) emphasizes that
while the past is closed and determinate, the future remains indeterminate until it is enacted. In
both cases, the implication is clear: causality is real, but it operates within an evolving framework
in which choice is not illusory, and novelty is an intrinsic feature of reality.

From the standpoint of a universe in which subjectivity is a structural property, this interplay
between determinism and openness becomes more than a physical fact — it becomes an
experiential one. The act of making a decision is not merely a mechanical selection between
options; it is the moment where individual perception and cosmic evolution converge. Because
every perceiving entity participates in shaping its future, the indeterminacy of what is to come is
not a gap in knowledge, but a genuine field of creative potential. Subjectivity, in this sense, is not
a passive witness to the unfolding of events, but an active force in steering the trajectory of reality
itself.


The Failure of Pure Materialism

Materialist reductionism often presents itself as the only rational stance, yet it too depends on
metaphysical commitments. By assuming the primacy of matter and the fixity of laws, it excludes
the possibility that the very constants of nature may themselves evolve (Smolin, 2013). Moreover,
it treats subjective experience as epistemically irrelevant, despite its undeniable reality to the
experiencer.
Such a view produces an existentially sterile cosmology — a “view from nowhere” (Nagel, 1986)
— in which meaning is accidental, agency is illusory, and consciousness is a disposable byproduct.
This paper instead posits that experience itself is evidence of reality’s deeper structure and should
be integrated into the scientific model rather than excluded from it.



Toward a Reintegrated Science and Subjectivity

This alternative framework does not reject empirical science but calls for its expansion. Just as the
Enlightenment liberated knowledge from dogmatic theology, the next intellectual step may require
liberating science from the constraints of reductive materialism. A reintegrated science would
acknowledge subjectivity as a legitimate domain of inquiry, much as William James (1912/1996)
advocated for a “radical empiricism” that takes experience in its totality as the starting point for
understanding reality.

Such a science would examine consciousness as a primary force, explore meaning as a structural
rather than accidental property, and embrace complexity and emergence without attempting to
reduce them to lower-level mechanisms. This would align with ongoing interdisciplinary efforts in
consciousness studies, complexity theory, and relational physics.
Conclusion: The Cosmos as Living Process

Materialism has offered predictive power but little purpose. Its great strength — objectivity — has
also become its limitation when applied as an absolute metaphysics. The perspective offered here
reframes the universe as a living system of evolving perception, where subjectivity is not an
afterthought but the very medium of existence. In such a cosmos, humans are not mere spectators
but active participants in reality’s unfolding — bearers of a continuity that links the smallest
physical interactions with the largest structures of meaning.



Methodology and the Limits of Falsification

A common objection to any theory that treats consciousness as a fundamental aspect of reality is
that it cannot be measured or falsified in the same way physical theories are. This concern is valid
— but it also reveals a deeper issue with how science currently approaches complex, emergent
phenomena.

The methods of modern science were developed to study systems that can be isolated, controlled,
and quantified: the path of a falling object, the charge of an electron, the spectrum of a star. In
such cases, falsification works beautifully: a prediction is either confirmed or disproven by
experiment. But when we move into the territory of emergence — where new properties arise from
the interaction of simpler parts — this neat process becomes harder to apply.

Consciousness, life, and the layered complexity of the universe resist reduction into fully
independent, measurable parts. In trying to isolate them, we risk destroying the very phenomenon
we want to study. The result is that such subjects are often dismissed, not because they are
unimportant, but because they do not fit into the existing methodological framework.
This does not make them unscientific. It means we must broaden what counts as legitimate scientific
inquiry. Many fields began with theories that could not be directly tested at first — plate tectonics,
the Big Bang, even aspects of quantum theory. Their initial value lay not in producing falsifiable
predictions immediately, but in offering a framework that explained more phenomena, with greater
coherence, than the models they replaced. Over time, new tools and experiments were developed
to probe their predictions.

Reductionism — the breaking down of systems into parts — is powerful for explaining rules, laws,
and processes. But if we want to understand how nature’s layers emerge from one another, from
matter to life to mind, then mathematics and physics alone will not suffice. We need a framework
that connects these layers, and consciousness, as a fundamental principle, offers such a possibility.

Falsifiability remains an important scientific value. But insisting on the tools of 20th-century
reductionism to test a 21st-century question is like trying to detect gravitational waves with a
thermometer. The tools must evolve with the questions.
