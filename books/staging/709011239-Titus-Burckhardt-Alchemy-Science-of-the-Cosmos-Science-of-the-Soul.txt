The son of the Swiss sculptor Carl Burckhardt,
Titus Burckhardt was born in 1908. His youth
was devoted to studies in art, art history, and
oriental languages and to journeys through
North Africa and the Near East. In 1942, he
became director of Urs Graf-Verlag, a publishing
house specializing in facsimile editions of ancient
manuscripts. He remained there until 1968. In
addition to writing books in German, he has
translated many important works from the
Arabic. Of his own books, An Introduction to Sufi
Doctrine, Sacred Art in East and West, and Moorish
Culture in Spain have appeared in English.

  The Penguin Metaphysical Library offers books that can
  recall in modern man the forgotten knowledge of how to
  search for himself, knowledge he has lost in his haste to
  make himself comfortable in the world. From the most
  diverse geographical origins and historical periods, and
 from a wide variety of traditions and literary forms, the
 editor has selected for this series books that have the com­
 mon goal of orienting man in the search for consciousness.
    Throughout the Western world, the realization is dawn­
 ing that contemporary science, including psychology,
 provides nothing for man that can take the place of the
 struggle for self-knowledge, and that most of our present
 religions have cut themselves off from the energy in their
 original teachings. Thus a great many Westerners are now
 seeking out ancient and modern texts that consider human
 life within cosmic schemes more purposeful than 'the uni­
 verse of modern science.
    But the understanding of how to relate these writings to
 our own lives remains elusive. Even the most serious and
 best informed among us are not sure which ideas are im­
 portant and which are unnecessary for a real inner search
 to begin. Therefore, out of this flood of esoteric, traditional,
 and mystical writings, the editor has chosen only material
 that bears on the aim of looking impartially and with
-fresh hope at the chaos we see within ourselves and in the
 world around us.

                  INTRODUCTION

 From the 'century of enlightenment' up to and including
 our own times, it has been customary to regard alchemy
 as a primitive precursor of modern chemistry. As a result
 of this, almost all the scholars who have concerned them-­
 selves with its literature have had no cause to see in it
 anything other than the earliest stages of later chemical
 discoveries. This one-sided way of looking at alchemy has
 at least had the merit of causing a distinction to be made
 between its corpus of traditional craft experience - in the
 preparation of metals, colours, and glass - and the
 apparently irrational procedures which play a central
 part in alchemy as such. As this corpus of craft experience
is known to be far from negligible, the alchemists' stub..
born adherence to the chemically meaningless formulae
of their magisterium could not fail to appear all the more
peculiar. People readily came to the conclusion that an
insatiable desire to make gold had persistently caused men
to believe in a heap of fantastic prescriptions, which,
rightly seen, were nothing more than a popular and
superstitious application of the natural philosophy of the
ancients; rather as if the alchemists had tried, partly by
means of physical procedures and partly by means of
magical conjurations, to lay direct hold on the Aristotelian
materia prima - the 'ground' of all things.
It never seemed to strike anyone as in the least improbable
that an 'art' of the kind alleged should, despite all its
folly and deceptions, have implanted itself for centuries
on end in the most diverse cultures of East and West.
On the contrary, people were much more inclined to take
the view that until a century or so ago all humanity had
been dreaming a stupid dream, the awakening from
which came only with our own times, as if the spiritual--
 intellectual faculty of man - his power to distinguish real
 from unreal - were itself subject to some sort of biological
 evolution.
 This way of looking at alchemy is contradicted by _a
 certain principle of unity running through alchemy it-­
self: descriptions of the 'great work' stem.ming from many
 cultures and many centuries evince, through an admitted
 multiplicity of symbols, certain unvarying basic features
 which are not to be explained empirically. In its essentials,
 Indian alchemy is the same as Western, and Chinese
alchemy, though set in a completely different spiritual
climate, can throw light on both. If alchemy were nothing
but a sham, its form of expression would betray arbi­
trariness and folly at every turn; but in fact it can be
seen to possess all the signs of a genuine 'tradition', that is
to say, an organic and consistent - though not necessarily
systematic - doctrine, and a clear-cut corpus of rules,
laid down and persistently expounded by its adepts. Thus
alchemy is neither a hybrid nor a haphazard product of
human history, but on the contrary represents a profound
possibility of the spirit and the soul.
This is also the view.of the self--styled 'depth psychology'
which purports to find in alchemical symbolism a con­
firmation of its own thesis of the 'collective unconscious'. 1
According to this view, the alchemist, in his dreamlike
search, brings to the light of day certain contents of his
own soul previously unknown to him, and thus, without
consciously intending to do so, brings about a kind of
reconciliation between his superficial, ego-bound, every­
day consciousness and the unformed (but form-seeking)
power of the 'collective unconscious'. This 'reconciliation'

 is supposed to give rise to an experience of inner fulfil­
 ment, which subjectively takes the place of the alleged
 alchemical magisterium. This view, like the foregoing, is
 based on the assumption that the alchemist's prime
 intention was to make gold. He was considered to be
 ensnared in a form of madness or self-deception, and
 because of this to think and act as one who is in a dream.
 This explanation possesses a certain plausibility, since
in one way it comes near to the truth - if only to depart
from it immediately! It is true that the spiritual reality,
to which the alchemical work is a sort of initiation, is
something of which the beginner is more or less un­
conscious. It is something hidden deep in the soul. Never­
theless, this 'secret depth' must not be confused with the
chaos of the so-called 'collective unconscious' - in so far
as this somewhat elastic concept has any precise meaning.
The alchemists' 'fountain of youth' in no wise springs
from an obscure psychic substratum; it flows from the
same source as the Spirit. It is hidden from the alchemist
at the beginning of his 'work', not because it is below
but because it is above the level of his conscious mental
processes.
The hypothesis of the psychologists evaporates as soon as
one realizes that the true alchemists were never ensnared
in any wish-fulfilling dream of making gold, and that they
did not pursue their goal like sleepwalkers or by means of
passive 'projections' of the unconscious contents of their
souls! On the contrary, they followed a deliberate method,
of which the metallurgical expression - the art of trans­
muting base metals into silver or gold - has admittedly
misled many uninitiated enquirers, although in itself it is
logical and, what is more, truly profound.

                        CHAPTER I


  THE ORIGIN OF WESTERN ALCHEMY

Alchemy has existed since at least the middle of the first
millennium before Christ, and probably since prehistoric
times. To the question: why should alchemy have existed
for millennia in such widely separated civilizations as
those of the Near East and Far East, the reply of most
historians would be that man has repeatedly fallen to the
temptation to get rich quickly by seeking to make gold and
silver from the common metals, until the empirical chemis-­
try of the eighteenth century finally proved to him that
metals could not be changed into one another. In actual
fact, however, the truth is quite different, and, in part at
least, exactly the opposite.
Gold and silver were already sacred metals, even before
they became the measure of all commercial transactions.
They are the earthly reflections of sun and moon, and thus
also of all the realities of spirit and soul which are related
to the heavenly pair. Until well into the Middle Ages the
relative values of the two noble metals were determined by
the relationship of the rotation times of the two heavenly
bodies. Likewise, the oldest coins usually bear pictures or
signs having some relation to the sun or its yearly rotation.
For men of pre-rationalistic times the relationship be­
tween the noble metals and the two great luminaries was
obvious, and a whole world of mechanistic notions and
prejudices was necessary to obscure the self-evident reality
of this relationship and make it look like a mere aesthetic
accident.
One must not confuse a symbol with a mere allegory, nor
try to see in it the expression of some misty and irrational
collective instinct. True symbolism depends on the fact
                                                           II
  that things, which may differ from one another in time,
  space, material nature, and many other !imitative charac­
  teristics, ca.n possess and exhibit the same essential quality.
  They thus appear as divers reflections, manifestations, or
 productions of the same reality - which in itself is inde­
 pendent of time and space. It is thus not· quite right to
 say that gold represents the sun, and silver the moon;
 rather is it the case that the two noble metals and the two
 luminaries are both symbols of the same two cosmic or
 divine realities.1
 The magic of gold thus springs from its sacred nature, or
 qualitative perfection, and only secondarily from its eco­
 nomic value. In view of the sacred nature of gold and
silver, the obtaining of these two metals could only be a
 priestly activity,just as the minting of gold and silver coins
 was originally the prerogative of certain holy places only.
 In keeping with this is the fact that the metallurgical
procedures relating to gold and silver which have been
preserved in some so..called primitive societies from pre..
historic times, reveal abundant signs of their sacerdotal
origin. 2 In 'archaic' cultures, unacquainted as yet with
the dichotomy of 'spiritual' and 'practical', and seeing
everything in relation to the inner unity of man and the
cosmos, the preparation of ores is always carried out as a
sacred procedure. As a rule it is, the prerogative of a
priestly caste, called to this activity by divine command.
Where this is not so, as in the case of certain African
tribes which have no metallurgical tradition of their own,
the smelter or smith, as an unauthorized interloper into
the sacred order of nature, falls under suspicion of en gag-

 ing in black magic. 3 What appears to modern man as
 superstitition - and what, in part, only survives as a
 superstitition - is in truth an inkling of the profound
 relationship between the natural order and the human
 soul. 'Primitive' man is well aware that the production of
 ores from the 'womb' of the earth and their violent puri­
 fication by fire is somehow sinister, and fraught with
 dangerous possibilities, even if he does not have all the
 proofs with which the history of the metallurgical age has
 so abundantly provided us. For 'archaic' humanity -
 which does not artificially separate matter from spirit -
 the arrival of metallurgy was not simply an 'invention',
 but rather a 'revelation', for only a divine command
 could authorize mankind in respect of such an activity.
 From the very beginning, however, this revelation was
 very much a 'two-sided' one4; it demands an especial
prudence on the part of him to whom it has been given.
Just as the outward work of the metallurgist with ore and
fire has something violent about it, so also the influences
which bear back on the spirit and the soul - and which
are inescapable in this calling - must be of a dangerous
and two-sided nature. In particular, the extraction of the
noble metals from impure ores by means of solvent and
purifying agents such as mercury and antimony and in
conjunction with fire, is inevitably carried out against the
resistance of the darksome and chaotic forces of nature,
just as the achievement of 'inward silver' or 'inward gold'
- in their immutable purity and luminosity - demands the
conquest of all the dark and irrational impulses of the
soul.

kind , .. ' (Koran, LVII, 25).
  The following report, from the autobiography of a Sene­
  galese, shows how, in certain African tribes, the working
 of gold has continued to be regarded as a sacred art right
  up to the present day� 5
  ' .•. On a sign from my father the two apprentices started
 working the sheepskin bellows, which were situated on
 either side of the forge and connected to it by means of
 clay pipes ... The flames in the forge shot up and seemed
 to come to life - an animated and evil genius.
 'My father then grasped the smelting--pot with his long
 tongs, and placed it on the flames.
 'All of a sudden all other work in the smithy was stilled,
for during the time that gold is being smelted, and while
it cools, it is forbidden to work either copper or aluminium
in its proximity, in• case even a particle of these base
metals should enter the smelting-pot. Only steel may
 continue to be worked. But even those engaged on a task
with steel would usually finish it quickly or lay it aside,
in order to join the apprentices gathered round the
forge ...
'When my father felt that his movements were being
impeded by the apprentices crowding round, he would
silently motion them to stand back. Neither he nor anyone
else would utter a word. No one dared speak, and even
the minstrel was silent. The stillness was broken only by
the wheezing of the bellows and the low hissing of the
gold. But though my father said not a word, I knew that
he spoke inwardly; I could see that from his lips which
moved silently as he stirred the gold and the charcoal with
a stick-which, as it caught fire, he had to keep replacing.
'What could he be saying inwardly? I cannot say for sure,
as he never told me. Yet what could it be but an invoca­
tion? Did he not invoke the spirit of the fire and of the
5Camara Laye, L'E,ifant noir, Paris, 1953.
14
  gold, of the fire and of the wind - the wind which blew
 through the bellows, of the fire that was born of the wind,
  and of the gold that was wedded to the fire? Assuredly he
 summoned their help and entreated their friendship and
  communion; assuredly he invoked these spirits. which are
 amongst the most important, and whose aid indeed is
 necessary for smelting.
 'The process which took place before my eyes was only
 outwardly the smelting of gold. It was something more
 besides: a magical process which the spirits could favour
 or hinder. That is why stillness reigned around my
 father ...
 'Was it not remarkable that at such a moment the little
 black snake always lay hidden under the sheepskin? For
it was not always there. It did not come and visit my
father every day, yet it never failed to appear when gold
was being worked. This did not really surprise me. Ever
since, one evening, my father told me of the spirit of our
tribe, I had found it quite natural that the snake should
be there, for the snake knew the future ...
'The artisan who works the gold must first of all purify
himself, must wash himself from head to foot, and,
during the time of the work, must abstain from sexual
intercourse . . . '
                             *

That there is an inward gold, or rather, that gold has an
inward as well as an outward reality, was only logical for
the contemplative way of looking at things, which spon­
taneously recognized the same 'essence' in both gold and
the sun. It is here, and nowhere else, that the root of
alchemy lies. Alchemy traces its descent back to a priestly
art of the ancient Egyptians; the alchemical tradition
which spread all over Europe and the Near East, and
                                                        15
 which perhaps even influenced Indian alchemy, recog­
 nizes as its founder Hermes Trismegistos, the 'thrice­
 great Hermes', who is identifiable with the ancient
 Egyptian God Thoth, the God who presides over all
 priestly arts and sciences, rather like Ganesha in Hinduism.
 The expression alchemia derives from the Arabic al-kimiya
 which is said to derive from the ancient Egyptian keme - a
reference to the 'black earth' which was a designation of
 Egypt and which may also have been a symbol of the
alchemists' materia prima. Another possibility is that the
expression derives from the Greek chyma ('smelting' or
 'casting'). At all events, the oldest extant alchemical
drawings are on Egyptian papyri. That no early Egyptian
documents remain is not surprising, since it is a� essential
feature of a sacred art that it is transmitted orally; that it
should be committed to writing is usually a first sign of
decadence, or of a fear that the oral tradition is going to
be lost. Thus it is completely .natural that the so-called
Corpus Hermeticum, which comprises all the texts ascribed
to Hermes-Thoth, has come down to us in Greek and
clothed in a more or less Platonic language. That these
texts are nevertheless descended from a genuine tradition,
and are in no wise pseudo-archaic fabrications of the
Greeks, is proved by their spiritual fruitfulness. The
evidence suggests that the so-called 'Emerald Tablet' is
also a part of the Corpus Hermeticum. The Emerald Tablet
declares itself to be a revelation from Hermes Trismegis­
tos, and is regarded by alchemists writing in Arabic and
Latin as nothing less than the 'table of law' of their art.
There is no early text of the Emerald Tablet. It has come
down to us only in Arabic and Latin translations - at
least so far as has been determined up to now - but its
contents bespeak its authenticity.
In favour of an Egyptian origin of Near-Eastern and
16
 Western alchemy is the fact that a whole series of artisanaI
 procedures, related to alchemy and furnishing it with
 many of its symbolic expressions, crop up as a coherent
 group, from late Egyptian times onwards, finally making
 an appearance in medieval prescription books. This
 corpus of procedures contains some elements clearly
 derivable from Egypt. Among these procedures, apart
from the working of metal and the preparation of dyes, is
 the production of artificial precious stones and coloured
glass, an art which blossomed nowhere more than in
 Egypt. Moreover, the whole of the Egyptian art of metals
and minerals, in its efforts to extract the secret and
precious essence from an earthy 'substance', shows an
obvious spiritual relationship with alchemy.
Late Egyptian Alexandria was doubtless the melting--pot
in which alchemy, along with other cosmological arts and
sciences, received the form in which it is now known to
us, without thereby being altered in any essential respect.
It may well have been at that time also that alchemy
acquired certain motifs from Greek and Asiatic mytho­
logies. This must not be regarded as in any way an
artificial happening. The growth of a genuine tradition
resembles that of a crystal, which attracts homologous
particles to itself, incorporating them according to its
own laws of unity.
From this time onwards one can observe two currents in
alchemy. One is predominantly artisanal in nature; the
symbolism of an 'inward work' appears here as something
superadded to a professional activity and is only mentioned
occasionally and incidentally. The other makes use of
metallurgical processes exclusively as analogies, so that
one may even question whether they were ever employt!d
'outwardly'. This has caused some to make a distinction
between artisanal alchemy - believed to be the older - and
a so..called mystical alchemy which is supposed to have
developed later. In reality, however, it is a case of two
aspects of one and the same tradition, of which the
symbolical aspect is undoubtedly the more 'archaic'.
It will no doubt be asked how it was possible for alchemy,
together with its mythological ground, to be incorporated
into the monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and
Islam. The explanation of this is that the cosmological
perspectives proper to alchemy, relating as they do both
to the outward realm of metals (and of minerals in general)
and to the inward realm of the soul, were organically
bound up with ancient metallurgy, so that the cosmo­
logical background was taken over, along with the craft,
simply as a science of nature (physis) in the broadest sense
of the term, rather as Christianity and Islam appropriated
the Pythagorean tradition in music and architecture, and
assimilated the corresponding spiritual perspective.
From the Christian point of view, alchemy was like a
natural mirror for the revealed truths: the philosophers'
stone, which turned base metals into silver and gold, is a
symbol of Christ, and its production from the 'non-burning
fire' of sulphur and the 'steadfast water' of quicksilver
resembles the birth of Christ-Emmanuel.
By its assimilation into Christian belief, alchemy was
spiritually fecundated, while Christianity found in it a
way which, through the contemplation of nature, led to
a true 'gnosis'.
Even more easily did the Hermetic art enter into the
spiritual world of Islam. The latter was always ready in
principle to recognize any pre-Islamic art which appeared
under the aspect 'wisdom' (/.zikmah) as a heritage of earlier
prophets. Thus in the Islamic world Hermes Trismegistos
is often identified with Enoch (Idr1S).
It was the doctrine of the 'oneness of existence' ( wabdat--
 18
al•wu;jud) - the esoteric interpretation of the Islamic con­
fession of faith - which gave to Hermetism a new spiritual
axis, or, in other words, re-established its original spiritual
horizon in all its fullness and freed it from the suffocation
of late Hellenistic 'naturalism'.
Meanwhile the symbolism of alchemy, as a result of its
gradual incorporation into late classical and Semitic
thought, had developed into a variegated multiplicity.
Nevertheless certain fundamental traits proper to alchemy
as an 'art' remained as its infallible token throughout
the centuries: above all the definite plan of the 'alchemical
work', the individual phases of which are characterized
by certain 'symbolical' processes which cannot always
be carried out in practice.
In the first instance alchemy made its entry into Western
Christendom through Byzantium, and later, and even
more richly, through Arab-dominated Spain. It was in
the Islamic world that alchemy reached its fullest flower­
ing. Jabir ibn Hayyan, a pupil of the sixth Shiite Imam
Jafar a�-Sadiq, founded in the eighth century A.D. a whole
school, from which hundreds of alchemical texts flowed
forth. No doubt it was because the nameJabir had become
the hallmark of much alchemical lore that the author of
the Summa Perfectionis, a thirteenth-century Italian or
Catalan, also assumed the name in its latinized form of
Geber.
When, with the Renaissance, the great inrush of Greek
philosophy occurred, a new wave of Byzantine alchemy
reached the West. In the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries many alchemical works were printed, which
until then had existed only as manuscripts and had
circulated more or less secretly. As a result of this the
study of Hermetism reached a new peak; it was soon,
however, to enter into decadence.
                                                            T t\
 The seventeenth century has often been regarded as mark­
 ing the full flowering of European Hermetism. In reality,
however, its decadence had already begun in the fifteenth
century, and proceeded apace with the humanistic and
 already fundamentally rationalistic development of West..
ern thought, by which any spiritual and intuitive univer­
sality of outlook was deprived of its very basis. It is true
that for a certain time immediately preceding the modern
age, elements of genuine gnosis, which had been squeezed
out of the realm of theology both by the unilaterally
sentimental development of later Christian mysticism, and
by the agnostic trend inherent in the Reformation, found
refuge in speculative alchemy. This undoubtedly explains
phenomena such as the echoes of Hermetism to be
detected in the works of Shakespeare, Jakob Boehme, and
Georg Gichtel.
   The medicine which derived from alchemy lived on
longer than alchemy itsel£ Paracelsus called this 'spagyric,
medicine. The term comes from the Greek words CJ1T(1.,W
and ay�r,pw, 'divide' and 'unite' - corresponding to the
alchemical solve et coagula.
In general, European alchemy following the Renaissance
had a fragmented character; as a spiritual art, the meta­
physical background was lacking. This is especially true
of its last remnants in the eighteenth century - even
despite the fact that, amongst all the 'charcoal burners',
men of real genius such as Newton and Goethe concerned
themselves with it - though unsuccessfully.
At this point it seems opportune to state categorically that
there can be no 'freethinking' alchemy hostile to the
Church, for the first prerequisite of every spiritual art is
that it should recognize everything that the human
condition, in its pre-eminence and in its precariousness,
needs by way of means of salvation. That there was also a
20
pre-Christian alchemy in no wise proves the contrary;
at all times alchemy was an organic part of a compre­
hensive tradition, which in some manner embraced all
aspects of human existence. To the extent, however, that
Christianity revealed truths which had been hidden to
pre-Christian antiquity, these had to be taken into
account by alchemy on pain of suicide. It is thus a major
error to believe that alchemy or Hermetism by itself
could possibly be a self-sufficient religion, or even a secret
paganism. Any attitude of this sort would necessarily be
so tinged with rationalism and humanism as to paralyse
from the start any effort towards the inward magisterium.
It is true that 'the Spirit bloweth where it listeth', and one
cannot from the outside impose dogmatic bounds on its
manifestation; but the Spirit certainly does not 'blow'
where it itself - the Holy Ghost - is denied in any of its
revelations.
In reality alchemy, which is not a religion by itself,
requires to be confirmed by the revelation -with its means
of grace - which is addressed to all men. This confirmation
consists in the alchemical way and work being recognized
by the alchemist himself as one particular means of access
to the full meaning of the eternal and saving message of
revelation.
We must dwell no longer on the history of alchemy, which
in any case is not known in detail, no doubt largely be­
cause the handing on of an esoteric art usually takes place
orally. One final point should, however, be mentioned;
the fact that alchemical writings often bear fantastic
names, out of all relation to chronology, allegedly as
their authors or sources, in no wise militates against the
worth of the texts in question; for, quite apart from the
fact that the historical viewpoint and alchemical wisdom
 have nothing to do with one another, these names (as in
the case of the Latin Geber) are indications of a given
'chain' of tradition, rather than intended as signatures of
authorship. The question as to whether a given Hermetical
text is genuine or not, that is to say, whether it proceeds
from true knowledge and experience of the Hermetic art
or has merely been arbitrarily put together, cannot be
determined either by philology or by a comparison with
empirical chemistry; the only criterion is the spiritual
unity of the tradition itse1£

    NATURE AND LANGUAGE OF ALCHEMY

In my book on the principles and methods of sacred art1
I more than once had occasion to refer to alchemy, by
way of comparison, when considering artistic creation
as it appears within a sacred tradition, not from the
point of view of its outward aesthetic aspect, but as an
inward process whose goal is the ripening, 'transmuta-­
tion', or rebirth of the soul of the artist himsel£ Alchemy
too was called an art - even the 'royal art' (ars regia) - by
its masters, and, with its image of the transmutation of
base metals into the noble metals gold and silver, serves
as a highly evocative symbol of the inward process referred
to. In fact alchemy may be called the art of the trans..
mutations of the soul. In saying this I am not seeking to
deny that alchemists also knew and practised metallurgi..
cal procedures such as the purification and alloying of
metals; their real work, however, for which all these
procedures were merely the outward supports or 'opera..
tional' symbols, was the transmutation of the soul. The
testimony of the alchemists on this point is unanimous.
For example, in The Book of Seven Chapters, which has been
attributed to Hermes Trismegistos, the father of Near­
Eastern and Western alchemy, we read: 'See, I have
opened unto you what was hid: The [alchemical] work is
with you and amongst you; in that it is to be found within
you and is enduring; you will always have it present,
wherever you are, on land or on sea ... ' 2 And in the
famous dialogue between the Arab king Khalid and the

1Sacred Art of East and West, Perennial Books, London r 967.
2Bibliotheque des philosophes chimiques, published by G. Salmon, Paris,
r741.
 sage Morienus (or Marianus) it is told how the king asked
 the sage where one could find the thing with which one
 could accomplish the Hermetic work. At this Morienus
 was silent, and it was only after much hesitation that he
 answered: 'O King, I declare the truth to you, that God
 in His mercy has created this extraordinary thing in your­
 self; wherever you may be, it is always in you, and cannot
 be separated from you . . . ' 3
 From all this it will be seen that the difference between
 alchemy and any other sacred art is that in alchemy
 mastery is attained, not visibly on the outward artisanal
 plane as in architecture and painting, but only inwardly;
 for the transmutation of lead into gold which constitutes
the alchemical work far exceeds the possibilities of ar­
tisanal skill. The miraculousness of this process, effecting
a 'leap' which, according to the alchemists, nature by
herself can only accomplish in an unforeseeably long time
highlights the difference between corporeal ,possibilities
and those of the soul. While a mineral substance, whose
solutions, crystallizations, smeltings, and burnings can
reflect up to a point the changes within the soul, must
remain confined within definite limits, the soul, for its
part, can overcome the corresponding 'psychic' limits,
thanks to its meeting with the Spirit, which is bound by
no form. Lead represents the chaotic, 'heavy', and sick
condition of metal or of the inward man, while gold -
'congealed light' and 'earthy sun' - expresses the per­
fection of both metallic and human existence. According
to the alchemists' way of looking at things, gold is the
real goal of the metallic nature; all other metals are either
preparatory steps or experiments to that end. Gold alone

Morienus or Marianus was probably the first alchemical treatise to
be translated from Arabic into Latin.
   possesses in itself a harmonious equilibrium of all metallic
   properties, and therefore also possesses durability. 'Copper
  is restless until it becomes gold', said Meister Eckhart,
  referring in reality to the soul, which longs for its own
  eternal being. Thus, in contradistinction from the usual
  reproach against them, the alchemists did not seek, by
  means of secretly conserved formulas in which only they
  believed, to make gold from ordinary metals. Whoever
  really wished to attempt this belonged to the so-called
  'charcoal burners' who, without any connection with the
 living alchemical tradition, and purely on the basis of a
 study of the texts which they could only understand in a
 literal sense, sought to achieve the 'great work'.
 As a way which can lead man to a knowledge of his own
 eternal being, alchemy can be compared with mysticism.
 This is already indicated by the fact that alchemical
 expressions were adopted by Christian, and even more so
 by Islamic, mysticism. The alchemical symbols of per­
fection refer to the spiritual mastery of the human state,
 to the return to the centre or mean, to what the three
monotheistic religions call the regaining of the earthly
paradise. Nicolas Flamel ( I 330- I 41 7), who as an alchem­
ist has recourse to the language of his Christian faith,
writes of the completion of the work, that it 'makes man
good by effacing from him the root of all sins, namely
covetousness, so that he becomes generous, mild, pious,
believing, and God-fearing, however bad he may have
been previously; because from now on he is continually
filled with the great grace and mercy which he has received
from God, and with the depth of His wonderful works'. 4
The essence and aim of mysticism is union with God.
Alchemy does not speak of this. What is related to the
mystical way, however, is the alchemical aim to regain
4   Bihl. des hil. chim.
 the original 'nobility' of hmnan nature and its symbolism;
for union with God is possible only by virtue of that which,
in spite of the incommensurable gulf between the creature
and God, unites the former to the latter - and this is the
'theomorphism' of Adam, which was 'displaced' or
rendered ineffective by the Fall. The purity of the symbol
man must be regained, before the human form can be
reassumed into its infinite and divine Archetype. Spirit..
ually understood, the transmutation of lead into gold is
nothing other than the regaining of the original nobility
of human nature. Just as the inimitable quality of gold
cannot be produced by the outward summation of metallic
properties such as mass, hardness, colour, etc., so 'Adamic'
perfection is no mere assemblage of virtues. It is as
inimitable as gold, and the man who has 'realized' this
perfection cannot be compared with others. Everything in
him is 'original', in the sense that his being is fully awak­
ened and united with its origin. As the realization of this
state necessarily belongs to the mystical way, alchemy can
in fact be regarded as a branch of mysticism.
And yet, the 'style' of alchemy is so different from that of
mysticism, which is directly based on a religious faith,
that some have been tempted to call it a 'mysticism with­
out God'. This expression, however, is perfectly inept, not
to say completely false, for alchemy presupposes a belief
in God, and almost all its masters place great importance
on the practice of prayer. The expression is true only to
the extent that alchemy as such possesses no theological
framework. Thus the theological perspective so charac­
teristic of mysticism does not delimit the spiritual horizon
of alchemy. Jewish, Christian, or Islamic mysticism is
centred on the contemplation of a revealed truth, an aspect
of God, or an 'idea' in the deepest sense of the word; it is
the spiritual realization of this idea. Alchemy, for its
 part, is primarily neither theological (or metaphysical)
 nor ethical; it looks on the play of the powers of the soul
 from a purely cosmological point of view, and treats the
 soul as a 'substance' which has to be purified, dissolved,
 and crystallized anew. Alchemy acts like a science or art
 of nature, because for it all states of inward consciousness
 are but ways of the one and only 'Nature', which encom­
 passes both the outward, visible and corporeal forms, and
 the inward and invisible forms of the soul.
 For all that, alchemy is not without a contemplative
 aspect. It by no means consists of mere pragmatism void
 of spiritual insight. Its spiritual, and in a certain sense
contemplative, nature resides directly in its concrete form,
in the analogy between the mineral realm and that of the
soul; for this similarity can only be perceived by a vision
which can look on material things qualitatively - in­
wardly, in a certain sense - and which grasps the things
of the soul 'materially' - that is to say objectively and
concretely. In other words, alchemical cosmology is
essentially a doctrine of being, an ontology. The metal­
lurgical symbol is not merely a makeshift, an approximate
description. of inward processes; like every true symbol, it
is a kind of revelation.
With its 'impersonal' way of looking at the world of the
soul, alchemy stands in closer relation to the 'way of
knowledge' (gnosis) than to the 'way of love'. For it is the
prerogative of gnosis - in the true and not the heretical
sense of the expression - to regard the '!'-bound soul
'objectively', instead of merely experiencing it subjectively.
This is why it was a mysticism founded on the 'way of
knowledge' that on occasion used alchemical modes of
expression, ifin fact it did not actually assimilate the forms
of alchemy with the degrees and modes of its own 'way'.
The expression 'mysticism' comes from 'secret' or 'to
withdraw' (Greek myein); the essence of mysticism eludes
a merely rational interpretation, and the same holds
good in the case of alchemy.



Another reason why alchemical doctrine hides itself in
riddles is because it is not meant for everyone. The 'royal
art' presupposes a more than ordinary understanding,
and also a certain cast of soul, failing which its practice
may involve no small dangers for the soul. 'Is it not
recognized', writes Artephius, a famous alchemist of the
Middle Ages, 5 'that ours is a cabbalistic6 art? By this I
mean that it is passed on orally, and is full of secrets. But
you, poor deluded fellow, are you so simple as to believe
that we would clearly and openly teach the greatest and
most important of all secrets, with the result that you
would take our words literally? I assure you in good faith
(for I am not so jealous as other philosophers), that who­
ever would take literally what the other philosophers
(that is, the other alchemists) have written, will lose him­
self in the recesses of a labyrinth from which he will never
escape, for want of Ariadne's thread to keep him on the
right path and bring him safely out ... ' 7 And Synesios, 8
who probably lived in the fourt� century A.D., writes: 'The
(true alchemists) only express themselves in symbols,
metaphors, and similes, so that they can only be under...
stood by saints, sages, and souls endowed with under ...
5 Artephius is perhaps the latinized name of an otherwise unknown
Arab author. (See: E. von Lippmann, Entstehung und Ausbreitung der
Alchemie, Berlin, 1919.) He must have lived before 1250.
6 'Cabbalistic' is understood here in the etymological sense of the

word, that is, 'handed down orally'.

 standing. For this reason they have observed in their
 works a certain way and a certain rule, of such a kind that
 the wise man may understand and, perhaps after some
 stumbling, attain to everything that is secretly described
 therein. ' 9 Finally Geber, who resumes the whole of
 medieval alchemical science in his Summa, declares :
 'One must not explain this art in obscure words only; on
 the other hand, one must not explain it so clearly that all
 may understand it. l therefore teach it in such a way that
nothing will remain hidden to the wise man, even though
 it may strike mediocre minds as quite obscure; the foolish
and the ignorant, for their part, will understand none of it
at all� . .' 10 One may well be surprised that, in spite of these
 warnings, ofwhich many more examples could be furnished,
many people - especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries- believed that by diligent study ofthe alchemical
texts they would be able to find the means of making gold.
It is true that alchemist authors often imply that they
preserve the secret of alchemy only to prevent anyone
unworthy acquiring a dangerous power. They thus made
use of an unavoidable misunderstanding to keep unquali­
fied persons at a distance. Yet they never spoke of the
seemingly material aims of their art, without also mention-­
ing the truth in the same breath. Whoever was motivated
by worldly passion would automatically fail to grasp the
essential in any explanation. Thus in the Hermetic Triumph
it is written: 'The philosophers' stone (with which one
can turn base metals into gold) grants long life and
freedom from disease to the one who possesses it, and
in its power brings rnore gold and silver than all the
mightiest conquerors have benveen them. In addition,
this treasure has an advantage above all others in this
9   Bibl. (US phil.
10  ibid.
                                                             nn
 life, namely, that whoever enjoys it will be perfectly happy
 - the very sight of it making him happy - and will never
 be assailed by the fear of losing it.' 11 The first sentence
 appears to confirm the outward interpretation of alchemy,
whereas the second indicates as clearly as is deemed
desirable, that the possession in question here is inward
and spiritual. The same is to be found in the already
mentioned Book of Seven Chapters: 'With the help of
Almighty God this [philosophers'] stone will free you and
protect you from the severest illnesses; it will also guard
you against sadness and trouble, and especially against
whatever may be harmful to body and soul. It ,vill lead
you from darkness to light, from the desert to home, and
from indigence to riches.' 12 The double meaning which is
to be perceived in all these quotations is in keeping with
the often expressed intention to teach the 'wise' and
mislead the 'foolish'.
    Because the alchemical mode of expression ) with all its
'hermetical' taciturnity, is no arbitrary invention, - but
$Omething entirely authentic, Geber was able to say, in
an appendix to his famous Summa: 'Whenever I have
seemed to speak most clearly and openly about our
science, I have in reality expressed myself most obscurely
and have hidden the object of my discourse most fully.
And yet in spite of all that, I have never clothed the
alchemical work in allegories or riddles, but have dealt
with it in clear and intelligible words and have described
it honestly, just as I know it to be and have myself learnt
it by divine inspiration . . . ' On the other hand, other
alchemists have purposely composed their writings in
such a way that the reading of them brings about the
separation of the sheep from the goats. The last mentioned
11   ibid.
12   ibid.
 work is an example of this, for Geber says in the same
 appendix: 'I hereby declare that in this Summa I have not
 taught our science systematically, but have spread it out
 here and there in various chapters; for if I had presented
 it coherently and in logical order, the evil-minded, who
 might have misused it, would be able to learn it just as
 easily as people of good will ...' If one studies closely the
 seemingly metallurgically-intended expositions of Geber,
 one will discover, in the midst of the more or less artisanal
 descriptions of chemical procedures, remarkable leaps of
 thought: for example, the author, who has not previously
mentioned a 'substance' (in connection with the 'work'),
will suddenly say: 'Now take this substance, which you
know well enough, and put it into the vessel ... ' Or sud­
denly, after stressing at length that metals are not trans­
muted by outward means, he speaks of a 'medicine that
heals all sick metals' by turning them into silver and gold.
On each such occasion, mental understanding is rudely
brought to a halt, and this indeed is the purpose of an
exposition of this kind. The pupil is made to experience
directly the limits of his reason (ratio), so that finally, as
Geber says of himself, he may look within himself: 'In
turning back on myself and meditating on the way in
which nature produces metals in the interior of the earth,
I perceived that true substance which nature has pre­
pared for us, so as to enable us to perfect them on earth ... '
Here one will note a certain similarity with the method of
Zen Buddhism, which seeks to transcend the limits of the
mental faculty by concentrated meditation on certain
paradoxes enunciated by a master.
That is the spiritual threshold which the alchemist has
to cross. The ethical threshold, as we have seen, is the
temptation to pursue the alchemical art only on account
of gold. Alchemists constantly insist that the greatest
                                                           �I
 obstacle to their work is covetousness. This vice is for their
 art what pride is for the 'way of love' and what self..
 deception is for the 'way of knowledge'. Here covetousness
is simply another name for egoism, for attachment to one's
own limited ego in thrall to passion. On the other hand, the
requirement that the pupil of Hermes must only seek to
transmute elements in order to help the poor - or nature
herself - in need, recalls the Buddhist vow to seek the
highest enlightenment only with a view to the salvation
of all creatures. Compassion alone delivers us from the
artfulness of the ego, which in its every action seeks only
to mirror itself.
                              *
It might be objected, that my attempt to explain the
meaning of alchemy is an infringement of the alchemists'
prime requirement, namely, the need for reserve in this
domain. To this it may be answered that it is in any case
impossible to exhaust by mere words the meaning of the
symbols which contain the key to the innermost secret of
alchemy. What can to a large extent be explained are the
cosmological doctrines fundamental to the alchemical
art, its view on man and nature, and also its general
mode of procedure. And even if one were able to interpret
the whole of the Hermetical work, there would always be
something left over which no written word can convey
and which is indispensable for the perfection of the work.
Like every sacred art in the true sense of the term (that is,
like every 'method' which can lead to the realization of
higher states of consciousness) alchemy depends on an
initiation: the permission to undertake the work must
nor�ally be obtained from a master, and only in the
rarest instances, when the chain from man to man has
been broken, may it happen that the spiritual influence
32
 leaps miraculously over the gap. In the conversation
 between King Khalid and Morienus it is said concerning
this: 'The foundation of this art is that whoever wishes to
pass it on must himself have received the teaching from
a master ... It is also necessary that the master should
often have practised it in front of his pupil ... For whoever
knows well the order of this work and has experienced it
himself, cannot be compared with one who has only
sought it in books ... '13 And the alchemist Denis Zach­
aire14 writes: 'Above all I should like it to be understood -
in case one has not yet learned it - that this divine
philosophy far exceeds purely human power; still less
can we acquire it from books, unless God has intro­
duced it into our hearts by the power of His Holy
Spirit, or has taught us through the mouth of a living
man ... ' 15

           THE HERMETIC WISDOM

 The perspective ofHermetism proceeds from the view that
 the universe (or macrocosm) and man (or the microcosm)
correspond to one another as reflections; whatever there
is in the one, must also in some manner be present in the
other. This correspondence may best be understood by
reducing it to the mutual relationship of subject and
object, of knower and known. The world, as object,
appears in the mirror of the human subject. Though these
two poles may be distinguished theoretically, they never-­
theless cannot be separated. Each one can only be
conceived in relation fo the other.
For the sake of clarity it is necessary to examine here the
various meanings that may be given to the term 'subject'.
If one says that man's view of the universe is 'subjective',
this usually means that the view in question depends on
man's particular position in space and time and on his
more or less developed ability and knowledge; 'subjective'
dependence is here that of the individual or of a temporally
and spatially limited group of people. Human under­
standing, however, is not merely limited from case to
case: it is specifically limited in itself, and in this sense
there is no such thing as a purely objective knowledge of
the world standing outside the sphere of the human
subject. Neither the agreement of all possible individual
observations nor the use of means which extend the reach
of the senses can get beyond this sphere, which conditions
both the world as a knowable object and man as a know­
ing being. The logical coherence of th,e world - that
which makes its manifold appearances a more or less
graspable whole - belongs just as much to the world as to
34
 the unitary nature of the human subject. Nevertheless,
 in every knowledge, however much of it may be coloured
 by the individual or the species, there is something un­
 conditional. Otherwise there would be no bridge from
 subject to object, from 'I' to 'thou', no truth and no unity
 behind the countless 'worlds' as seen by so many and so
 widely varying individuals. This unconditioned and im­
 mutable element, which is the source of the more or less
 hidden 'truth-content' in every piece of knowledge - and
without which it would not be knowledge at all - is the
 pure Spirit or Intellect, which as knower and known is
 absolutely and indivisibly present in every being.
 Of all beings in this world man is the most perfect reflec­
tion of the universal - and, as regards its origin, divine
- Intellect, and in this respect he can be regarded as the
mirror or total image of the cosmos.
Let us pause for a moment in order to consider the
different realities which stand facing one another like
mirrors: first and foremost there is the Universal Intellect
or 'Transcendental Subject', whose object is not only the
outward physical world, but also the inner world of the
soul - as well as the reason; for the operations of the
reason can be the object of knowledge, whereas the
universal intellect is incapable of any 'objectivization'
whatsoever. It is true that the Intellect has direct and
immediate knowledge of itself, but this knowledge lies
beyond the world of distinctions, so that, from the point
of view of distinctive perception (divided as it is into
object and subject), it seems non-existent� Rather different
is the human subject, endowed as it is with the faculties
of thought, imagination, and memory, and dependent on
sensory perception, for the human subject. has as object
the whole corporeal world. It is from the Universal
Intellect that the human subject derives its capacity for
knowing. Finally there is man himself, composed of spirit
 (or intellect), soul, and body, who is both part of the cos­
mos which is the object of his knowledge and who also, in
virtue-ofhis special rank (that is, his pre-eminently spiritual
nature) appears as a small cosmos within the larger one,
of which he is the counterpart, like a reflected image.
   Thus, the traditional doctrine of the reciprocal corre­
spondence of the cosmos and the human being is also
founded on the idea of the unique and Transcendent
Intellect, whose relationship to what is commonly called
'intellect' (namely reason alone) is like that of a source
of light to its reflection in a restricted medium. 1 This
idea, which is a link between cosmology (the science of
the cosmos) and pure metaphysics 2 is by no means the
special prerogative of Hermetism although it is expounded
with particular clarity in the writings of Hermes Tris­
megistos, the 'thrice-great Hermes'.
In one of these writings it is said of the Intellect or Spirit:
'The Intellect (nous) derives from the substance (ousia) of
God, in so far as one may speak of God having a sub­
stance3 ; of what nature this substance is, God alone can
know exactly. 4 The Intellect is not a part of the substance
of God, but radiates from the latter as light shines forth
from the sun. In human beings, this Intellect is God ... ' 5
1 Reason may be compared to a convex lens, which directs the light
of the Intellect or Spirit in a particular direction and on a limited
field.
2 By 'metaphysics' is meant the doctrine of the uncreated. The greater

part of Aristotle's 'metaphysics' is no more than cosmology. A charac"
teristic of true metaphysics is its apophatic character.
3
  'Ousia' has been translated by 'substance' in accordance with
scholastic usage. In reality it is a question here of the 'essence' of God.
4 That is, the substance ( or rather, essence) of God cannot be known

by anything outside itself, because it is beyond all duality and all
distinction between object and subject.

Lettres', I 945. Chapter entitled: 'D'Hermes Trismegiste: Sur !'intellect
com.mun, a Tat.'

 One must not let oneself be misled by the inevitable
 defectiveness of the simile here employed. When one
speaks of the radiation or shining forth of the Intellect
from its Divine Source one does not mean some sort of
material emanation.
In the same book it is said that the soul (psyche) is present
in the body in the same manner as the intellect (nous)
is present in the soul, and as the Divine Word (Logos) is
present in the intellect. (It can also be said, the other way
round, that the body is in the soul as the soul is in the
spirit or intellect, and the spirit in the Word.) God is
called the Father of all.
It will be seen how close this doctrine is to that ofJohan­
nine theology - a fact which explains how Christian
circles in the Middle Ages were able to see in the writings
of the Corpus Hermeticum (as in those of Piato) the pre­
Christian '_seeds' of the Logos. 6
Although the doctrine of the transcendent unity of the
Intellect is affirmed by all revealed scriptures, it never­
theless remains esoteric in that it cannot be transmitted
to everyone without the risk of a misleading simplifica­
tion. The chief danger is that, in its effort to comprehend,
the imagination may conceive of the unity of the Spirit
or Intellect, as a sort of material unity. This would lead
to the obscuring of the distinction between God and
creation, as well as of the essential uniqueness of each
individual creature.
The Universal Intellect is not one numerically, but one
in its indivisibility. In this way it is wholly present in each
creature, and from it each creature derives its uniqueness,
for there is nothing which possesses more unity, wholeness,
and perfection than that through which it is known.
6 St Albert the Great, amongst others, looked on the hermetic writings
in this way.
 An. example of a false view concerning the one Intellect
 present in all beings is provided by the philosophical
 opinion that, when the individual spiritual being leaves
 the body at the time of death, it immediately returns to
 the Universal Intellect, so that there is no separate sur-­
vival after death. However, that which, in this life, confers
an 'ego--ic' limitation on the infinite light of the Intellect,
is not the body, but the soul. Now the soul survives after
separation from the body, even vvhen, in this life, it was
entirely orientated towards the body and indeed appeared
to have no other content than this. 7
Since the Intellect, as the cognitive pole of universal
existence, is not accessible to discursive knowledge, know­
ledge of it will not. change the experience of the world -
at least not in the realm of facts. Essential knowledge does,
however, determine the inward assimilation of this
experience, i.e., the grasping of its truth. For modern
science 'truths' (or general laws) - without which mere
experience would be no more than shifting sand - are
only simplifying descriptions of appearances, useful but
always provisional 'abstractions'. For traditional science,
on the other hand, truth is the expression or 'congelation'
(in a form accessible to the reason) of a possibility con­
tained in the Universal Intellect. And since this possibility
is permanently and immutably contained in the Intellect,
it must also manifest itself in the outward world. The idea
of truth is thus much more absolute in traditional than in
modern science - without, nevertheless, the conceptual
forms of truth ever becoming an end in themselves, since
the reason's and the imagination's grasp of truth is no
more than a symbol of the possibilities contained in the
eternal Intellect.
7    This is the reason for the agonies suffered by souls that have been
wholly orientated towards the body, when they leave the body •
.... o
    According to the modern point of view science is built
 up exclusively on the basis of experience. From the tra..
 ditional point of view, experience is nothing without that
 core of truth which comes from the Intellect, and around
 which individual experiences can crystallize. Thus Her­
 metic science is based on certain traditional symbols which
 derive from a spiritual revelation. The expression 'revela..
 tion' is used here in a somewhat wider sense than that
usually given to it by theology, but is not intended in a
purely poetic sense. In Hindu terms, the spiritual process
in question would be regarded as a revelation 'of second
rank', that is to say, as smriti rather than shruti. In Christian
terms, one would speak of an inspiration of the Holy
Spirit, intended not for the whole community of the faith­
ful but only for certain people capable of a particular
mode and degree of contemplation. It was in this way, at
any rate, that Christian alchemists regarded the heritage
of Hermetism. Hermetism is in fact a branch of the
primordial revelation which, having persisted throughout
all ages, extends also into the Christian and Islamic
worlds.
The immutable possibilities contained in the Intellect
cannot be grasped immediately by the reason. Plato
called these possibilities ideas or archetypes, and one
would do well to preserve the true meaning of these
expressions, and not apply them to mere generalizations
- which at best are no more than reflections of true ideas -
nor to the purely psychological realm known as the
'collective unconscious'. The latter misuse is especially
misleading since it involves a confusion of the indivisi­
bility of the Intellect with the impenetrability of the
passive and darksome depths of the soul. The archetypes
are to be found not below, but above the level of reason,
and so it is that whatever the reason can discern regarding
 them is never more than a severely restricted aspect of
 what they really are in themselves. Only in the 'one-ing'
 of the soul with the Spirit - or its return into the undivided
 unity of the Spirit - does a certain reflection of the eternal
 possibilities in the formal consciousness take place. The
 contents of the Intellect, which is, as it were, the 'faculty'
 of the Spirit, thus suddenly 'congeal', in the form of
symbols, in the reason and the imagination.
 In the book of the Corpus Hermeticum known as 'Poiman ..
dres' it is described how the Universal Intellect revealed
itself to Hermes..Thoth: '. . . With these words, He looked
me long in the face, so that I trembled before his gaze.
Then, as He raised His head again, I saw how in my
own spirit (nous) the light which consists of a numberless
number of possibilities, became an infinite All, while the
fire, surrounded and so contained by an almighty power,
had attained its immobile position: such is what I was
able to grasp rationally of this vision . . . While I was so
completely out of myself, He spoke again: thou hast now,
in the intellect (nous), seen the prototype, the origin, and
the never..ending beginning . . . ' 8
   A symbol is whatever, on the planes of the soul and the
body, reproduces spiritual prototypes. In connection with
this reflection of higher realities on lower planes, the
imagination possesses a certain advantage over abstract
thought. In the first place, it is capable of multiple inter..
pretation; furthermore, it is not so schematic as abstract
thought, and also, in so far as it 'condenses' itself into a
pure image, it relies on the inverse correspondence that
exists between the corporeal and spiritual realms, accord­
ing to the law that 'whatever is below resembles that which
is above', as the 'Emerald Tablet' puts it.

     In so far as the human intellect, as a result of a more or
  less complete union with the Universal Intellect, turns
 away from the multiplicity of things and so to say ascends
 towards undivided unity, so the knowledge of nature
 which a man obtains from such an insight cannot be of a
 purely rational or discursive kind. For him the world has
 now become as if transparent: in its appearances he sees
 the reflection of eternal 'prototypes'. And even when this
 insight is not immediately present, the symbols which spring
 from it nevertheless arouse the memory or 'recollection'
 of these prototypes. Such is the Hermetic view of nature.
 What is decisive for such a view is not the measurable and
 enumerable nature of things, conditioned as it is by
temporal causes and circumstances; rather is it their
essential qualities, which one can imagine as the vertical
threads (warp) of a woven material, taken as representing
the world, round which the shuttle alternately winds the
horizontal thread (woof), thus making the woven material
a unitary and compact material. The vertical threads are
the immutable contents or 'essences' of things, while the
horizontal threads represent their 'substantial' nature,
dominated by time, space, and similar conditions. 9
From this comparison one can see how a vision of the
cosmos based on spiritual tradition in a 'vertical' sense
can be right, even although it may appear inexact in a
 . .
'horizontal',   sense - that is to say in the sense of discursive
and analytical observation. Thus, for example, it is not
necessary to know every existing metal in order to know
directly the prototype of metal in itself. It is enough to
take into consideration the seven metals mentioned by
tradition - gold, silver, copper, tin, iron, lead, and quick­
silver - in order to understand the possible range of

 variation within the one type. (We are only concerned
 here with the qualitative aspect of metal.) It is the same
 as regards the knowledge of the four elements, 10 which in
 alchemy play such a major role. These elements are not
 the chemical constituents of things, but are the qualitative
 determinants of 'matter' as such, so that, instead of
 speaking of earth, water, air, and fire, one can also speak of
matter's solid, liquid, aerial, or igneous mode of existence.
 The analytical evidence, that water consists of two parts
of hydrogen and one part of oxygen, tells us absolutely
nothing about the essence of the element water. On the
contrary, this fact, which can only be known circum­
stantially and so to say abstractly, actually obscures the
essential quality 'water'. Furthermore the scientific ap-­
proach strictly limits the reality in question to one given
plane, whereas the immediate and symbolical intuition
of the element awakens an echo which resounds through
all levels of consciousness, from the corporeal to the
spiritual.
!vfodern science 'dissects' things, with a view to possessing
and mastering them on their own level. Its aim is above
all technology. Rationalism clung to the belief that by
means of material and quantitative analysis it could dis­
cover the true nature of things. Characteristic of this
point of view is Descartes' opinion that the scholastic
definition of man as 'an animal endowed with reason'
tells us nothing about man unless, by the study of his
bones, tendons, tissues, etc., we know what the word
'man' really means.11 As if a definition were not all the

(akasha), the quinta essentia of the alchemists, as being also one of the

nearer to the essential, the broader it is! Analytical
understanding is ultimately nothing more than the knife
which probes into the joints of things. By so doing, it permits
a clearer view of these. But the essence is not accessible to
mere dissection. Goethe understood this very well when
he said that what nature did not reveal to us in the light
of day, could not be forced out of her by 'levers and
screws'.
                                *
The difference between traditional cosmology, such as
Hermetic cosmology, and analytical science, dominated
by reason alone, shows itself most clearly in their astro­
nomical outlook. The oldest world-picture, in which the
earth is seen as a disc covered by the starry vault of
heaven, is fraught with the most general and profound
meanings - meanings which are all the less obsolete in
that this world-picture remains true, being none other
than the natural and immediate experience of all mankind.
Heaven, by its movement the measurer of time, the
determiner of day and night and the seasons, the cause of
the rising and the setting of the luminaries, the dispenser
of rain, manifests the active and masculine pole of
existence. The earth, on the other hand, which under the
influence of Heaven becomes pregnant, brings forth
plants and nourishes all living creatures, corresponds to
the passive and feminine pole. This relationship of Heaven
and earth, of active and passive existence, is the proto­
type and exemplar of numerous analogous dualities, such
as the conceptual pair 'essential form' (eidos, forma) and
'stuff, or 'substance' (hyle, materia) and the duality, under­
stood in the Platonic sense, of spirit or intellect (nous) and
soul (psyche).
The circular movement of the heavens implies the exist-
ence of a motionless and invisible axis, corresponding to
the Intellect, which is immutably present in all circum­
stances of the world. Likewise the course of the sun traces
a regular cross composed of the cardinal points - North
and South, East and West - following which the cosmic
qualities which govern all life distribute themselves
respectively as cold and warm, dry and humid. We shall
see later how this order is repeated within the microcosm
of the human soul.
The sun's course, in so far as it appears above the horizon,
follows an increasingly wide circle from the winter solstice
to the summer solstice, and then an increasingly narrow
circle until the full year comes round. Basically this
corresponds to an 'unwinding', spiral which, after so many
turns, becomes a 'winding-up', spiral - an image which
has been portrayed in a variety of signs, such as the
double spiral,




 the twofold spiral vortex, familiar as the Chinese yin-:,Yang,
 and not least in the staff of Hermes (the caduceus) in which
 two snakes are entwined on an axis - the world axis. 12
 The opposition made manifest in the two phases of the
 sun's course (the ascending and the descending) corre­
 sponds in a certain sense to the opposition between heaven
 and earth - with this difference, that here both sides are
 mobile, so that, instead of an .opposition of causes, it is a
 question of an alternation of forces. Heaven and earth
_are above and below; the two solstices are south and
 north; they are related to one another as are expansion
 and contraction. We shall again come across this opposi-

 The Ptolemaic world..picture (in which the earth as a
 globe represents the centre, around which the planets
 revolve in a variety of orbits or spheres, surrounded by
 the heaven of fixed stars and, at the outside, by the
 Empyrean devoid of all stars) does not take away the
 meaning of the earlier world-picture any more than it
takes away mankind's immediate experience of it. It
 brings, moreover, into play a different symbolism, namely
that of the all-comprehending character of space. The
gradation of heavenly spheres reflects the ontological
order of the world, according to which each degree of
existence proceeds from a higher one, in such a way that
the higher degree 'contains' the lower one, just as a cause
'contains' its effect. Thus the wider the heavenly sphere
in which a star moves, the purer, the less conditioned, and
the nearer to the divine origin is the degree of existence
or the level of consciousness which corresponds to it. The
starless Empyrean, which surrounds the starry heavens
and which seems to impart to the firmament of fixed
stars (the fastest and most regularly revolving of all the
spheres) its movement, represents the prime mover
(primum mobile), and so also the all-embracing Divine
Intellect.
This was the interpretation of the Ptolemaic world­
picture adopted by Dante. Before his time it was already
to be found in Arab writings. There is also an anonymous
Hermetical manuscript of the twelfth century, written in
Latin and probably of Catalan origin, 13 in which the

  spiritual meaning of the heavenly spheres successively
  surrounding one another is presented in a manner
 reminiscent of the Divine Comedy. The ascent through
 the spheres is described as an ascent through a hierarchy
 of spiritual (or intellectual) degrees, by means of which
 the soul, which successively realizes these, gradually
 turns from a discursive knowledge bound to forms to an
 undifferentiated and immediate vision in which subject
 and object, knower and known, are one. This description
 is illustrated by drawings which show the heavenly
 spheres as concentric circles, through which men ascend,
as if on Jacob's ladder, to the highest sphere, the
Empyrean, on which Christ sits enthroned. 14 The heavenly
circles are complemented in a downward direction - that
is, towards the earth - by the elements. Next to the lunar
sphere is the circle of fire; under this is the circle of air,
which encloses water, which immediately surrounds the
earth. It is noteworthy that this anonymous manuscript,
the Hermetic character of which is evident, recognizes the
validity of all three monotheistic religions, Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam. This clearly demonstrates how
the Hermetic science, thanks to its purely cosmological
symbolic language based on nature, can be combined
with every genuine religion without conflict with the
respective dogmas.
    As the revolution of the eighth heaven, the firmament
of fixed stars, is the basic measure of time, so the outermost
starless heaven (which imparts to the eighth its slightly
behind-hand movement, delayed by the so•called pro-

Folio 90 shows at the top the enthroned Christ above the spheres.
Alongside are the words: 'Creator omnium Deus - Causa prima -
Voluntas divina - Voluntas divina'     ( The Creator of all things,
God - the first Cause - the Divine    Will - the Divine Will). The
two uppermost circles contain the words 'Jonna in potentia' and
'materia in potentia'. These are the two poles   forma   and   materia
prima, Pure Act and Passi_ve Receptacle,    which are here conceived
as possibilities contained in Pure Being, and not yet manifested.
This is why they lie outside the Universal Spirit, when this_ is
viewed. in its manifested or created reality, which is represented by
the next circle: 'Causatum primum esse creatum primum principium
omnium creaturarum continens in se creaturas' (first effect, first
created being, principle of all creatures, containing all creatures
within itself). As stages within the Universal Spirit there follow
ten intellectual or cognitive faculties ('intelligentiae'), to which
correspond a similar number of angelic choirs. Curious{y the order
in which they appear is   tM ,;;act qpposite to that of the Dionysian
48
embracing, Being. Dante represents this crossing - which
involves a complete reversal of viewpoint - by confronting
the cosmic order of concentric spheres which widen
successively from earthly limitation to Divine Infinity,
with a reversed order, whose centre is God, around Whom
the choirs of angels revolve, in ever widening circles. They
revolve fastest where they are nearest the Divine origin -
in contradistinction from the cosmic spheres, whose
apparent movement grows in proportion to their distance
from the earthly centre. - With this 'up..turning' of the


 doctrine of the Heavenly Hierarchy; from above downwards they
 are: 'Angeli', 'Archangeli', ' Troni', 'dominati"ones', 'virtutes',
 'principatus', 'potestates', 'Cherubim', 'Seraphim' _and 'ordo
 senorum' ( choir of elders). This reversal of order may b.e due to the
 error of a copyist who had a theocentric scheme in mind�
 Beneath these ten spheres ef the supra-formal Spirit lie four spheres
 of the soul: 'Anima celestis', 'Anima rationabilis', 'Anima
 animalis' and 'Anima vegetabilis'.
 So far the concentric order of the spheres is intended purely .rym..
 bolically, whereas the succeeding (and ever smaller) spheres of the
 corporeal world are to be understood both �mbolically and spati­
 ally: the corporeal world is surrounded by its outermost circle:
 'Natura principium corporis' (Nature as principle of bodies). It
 contains the astronomic spheres, the outermost ef which corresponds
 to the daily revolution of the heavens: 'Spera decima - spera
 suprema qua fit motus de occidente ad orientem et est principium
 motus' (tenth sphere - highest sphere, in which takes place the
 movement from West to East, and which is the principle of all
 movement). Inside this is the sphere which determines the pre­
 cession of the equinoxes: 'Spera nona - spera motus octave spera qua
fit motus eius de septentrione ad meridiem et e converso' (ninth
 sphere, which moves the dghth sphere and causes it to travel from
                                                                   49

The world-picture in which the sun represents the centre,
around which all planets, including the earth, revolve,
is not an original discovery of the Renaissance. Coper­
nicus merely revived - and supported with observations




North to South and vice versa) . Then follow in descending order
the heaven of fixed stars and the planetary spheres: 'Spera
octava - spera stellata .,· Saturnus - spera saturni .,· Jupiter - spera
iovis; Mars - spera martis; Sol - spera solis; Venus - spera
veneris; Mercurius - spera mercurii; Luna - spera lunae.' Inside
these lie the four elements in concentric circles around the centre of
the earth ( the outermost circle corresponds both to the domain of
the elements as such, and to the highest element fire) : 'Ignis -
corpus corruptihilis quad est quatuor elementa' (Fire - corruptible
body consisting of the four elements); 'aer' .,· 'acqua'; 'terra';
'centrum mundi'.
 Through these circles of the spiritual, psychic and corporeal worlds
men rise to God as if on a ladder. The lowest figure is still bound
to the domain of the elements and a companion is dragging him up
from this by the hair. Alongside the uppermost group is written:
'0 mi magist[er]' (0 my Master?), alongside the next: '[e]
 phebei' ('youths '>), alongside the middle group: 'socii omnes' ( all
companions), and alongside the lowest: 'cetera turba' ( the remain­
ing crowd). This is presumably a reference to different degrees of
 wisdom or initiation.
 The other miniature, onfolio 89, repeats the same order, this time
 with complete circles but with on?, partial inscriptions.

  - an idea which was already known to antiquity. 16 As
  a symbol, the heliocentric world-view is the necessary
  complement of the geocentric. For the divine origin
  of the world - that is to say the one Intellect or Spirit
  through whom God produces the world - can just as
 easily be thought of as the All-Embracing (correspond­
 ing to limitless space) > as it can be thought of as the
 one 'radiating' Centre of all manifestation. Precisely
 because the Divine Origin is so high above all differentia­
 tion, each representation of it has to be complemented by
 its own inverted counterpart, as if seen in a mirror.
 The heliocentric world-view, however, was in fact used by
 rationalism to prove that the traditional geocentric world­
 view - and all the spiritual interpretations connected with
it - were pure deception. And from this arose the
paradox that a philosophy which made of human reason
the measure of all reality, resulted in an astronomical
world-view in which man was to appear more and more
like a speck of dust amongst other specks of dust, a mere
accident without any sort of cosmic precedence, while the
medieval perspective, based not on human reason but on
revelation and inspiration, had placed man at the centre
of the cosmos. This blatant contradiction is nevertheless
simple to explain. The rationalistic view forgets completely
that everything which it may express concerning the
universe, remains a content of human consciousness, and
16 The heliocentric system was already taught by Aristarchos of
Samas (ca. 320-250 B.c.). Nicholas Copernicus, in the preface to his
work On the Courses of the Heavenly Bodies addressed to Pope Paul III,
refers to Hicetas of Syracuse and to certain indications by Plutarch.
In his book on the heavens Aristotle writes: 'Whereas most (learned
men) believe that the earth is the centre (of the world), the Italic
philosophers, the so-called Pythagoreans, are of the opposite view;
for they assert that in the centre there is fire. The earth on the other
hand, which is one of the stars, moves in a circle round the centre .•. '
Probably certain Indian astronomers of antiquity were also familiar
with the heliocentric view.
 that man, precisely because he can look at his physical
 existence from a higher point of view - as if he were not,
 in fact, bound to this earth - clearly demonstrates that he
 is the cognitive centre of the world. Precisely because man
 is the privileged bearer of the Intellect, and therefore may
 know essentially all that is, the traditional perspective
 places him at the centre of the visible world, which
 position, in fact; entirely corresponds with immediate
sensory experience. In the same view, namely that of
 traditional cosmology, the heliocentric world-picture, in
which man is, so to say, peripheral to the sun, can only
have an esoteric meaning, namely that which Dante has
in mind in his 'theocentric' description of the angelic
world: from the point of view of God man is not in the
centre, but on the outermost border of existence.
That the heliocentric viewpoint should seem more correct
from the physical-mathematical point of view is an indi­
cation that this point of view itself has something not
quite human about it ... It refuses to consider man as a
whole, as a being composed of spirit (intellect), soul, and
body, in favour of an exclusive consideration of the
material-quantitative plane, and so becomes the 'inferior'
reflection of the viewpoint which sees man sub specie
aeternitatis.
No world-picture can ever be absolutely right, for the
reality which our observation takes cognizance of is
conditioned, dependent, and endlessly multiple.
Belief in the heliocentric system as something absolute
has created a tremendous vacuum: man has been robbed
of his cosmic dignity, and having been made a meaning­
less speck of dust amongst all other specks of dust circling
round the sun, has shown himself incapable of achieving
a spiritually satisfying vision of things. Christian thought,
centred on the incarnation of Christ, was ill prepared for
 this. To be able to see man as a disappearing nothingness
 in cosmic space, and at the same time as the cognitive
 and symbolical centre of the latter, quite exceeds the
 capacity of the majority.
Latterly, with the consignment of the sun itself into the
stream of countless millions of other suns (perhaps also
surrounded by planets) with perhaps thousands and
millions of light years between them, no world-picture,
in any true sense of the term, is any longer possible. The
 'construction' of the world is no longer imaginable, with
the result that man loses his capacity to integrate himself
into a meaningful whole. Such at least is the usual effect
of the modern viewpoint on Westerners� The Buddhist
way of seeing things, which has always regarded the world
as shifting sand, may show a different response to the
scientific thesis.
If scientific knowledge went hand in hand with a spiritual
evaluation of appearances, one would be able to see, in
the successive abandonment of all so to say closed systems,
a proof that every vision of the world is no more than an
image or reflection and as such is in no wise uncondi­
tional. For this world, the sun, which our unaided senses
experience, is the sum total oflight and the natural symbol
of that divine origin which illumines all things and around
which all things revolve. At the same time, however, it is
merely a luminous body, and as such not unique, but one
thing amongst others of the same kind.
This is not the place to show how each new world-picture
is demanded, not so much by new scientific observations,
as by the logical 'unilateralness' of the preceding one.
This applies also to the latest conceptions of space.
Medieval cosmology imagined the totality of space as an
immeasurably great sphere spiritually encompassed by
the outermost heavens. Rationalistic philosophy con-
 sidered space to be infinite. Since, however, as conditioned
 extension, it may well be indefinite but is certainly not
 infinite, the next scientific step leads to a virtually
 unimaginable concept of a 'curved' space flowing back
into itself!
 The unconditional homogeneity of space and time is
abandoned by the latest mathematics in favour of a con..
stant relationship between space and time. If, however,
space is that which contains all that is simultaneously
observed, and time is that which constitutes the succession
of observations, then automatically the fixed stars are no
longer separated from us by so many light years, but are
situated where visible and simultaneously existing space
has its outermost limit. In the face of this paradox, let it
merely be said that ultimately every 'scientific' world­
picture is doomed to contradict itself, whereas the spiritual
meaning which manifests itself in one way or another in
all visible things and which reveals itself all the more
convincingly, the more primordial and the more suited
to man the world-picture is, undergoes no change of any
kind. If we speak here of a meaning, we do not mean
anything conceptual. We use the expression 'meaning',
of necessity and after the example of traditional writings,
to designate the immutable content of things, which only
the intellect is capable of grasping.
                             *
By means of the preceding observations on the astro..
nomical world-picture, we have perhaps succeeded in
showing that there are two mutually opposed ways of
looking at the world, or nature in the widest sense of this
word. The one, impelled by scientific curiosity, strives
towards the inexhaustible multiplicity of appearances,
and, to the extent that it accumulates experiences, becomes
 itself multiple and dismembered. The other strives after
 the spiritual centre, which is at once the centre of men and
 of things, while supporting itself on the symbolical charac­
 ter of appearances, in order to presage and contemplate
 the realities immutably contained in the Divine Intellect..
 The latter point of view leads to simplification, not with
 regard to what it perceives as a multiple gradation, but
with regard to what it deems to be essential. The most
 perfect vision which man can achieve is simple, in the
 sense that its inward richness is devoid of differentiated
 characteristics. This highest vision or contemplation is
referred to in a Syriac Hermetical text, from which we
should like to quote a few extracts as a concl¥sion to this
 chapter on Hermetical wisdom. (The text in question
 speaks of a secret mirror, which is set up behind seven
 doors, which correspond to the seven planetary spheres) :
 ' ... The mirror was so made that no man could see him'.'"

                  SPIRIT AND MATTER

 For the people of earlier ages, what we today call matter
 was not the same as for the people of today, either as
 regards the concept or the experience. This is not to say
 that the so-called primitive peoples of the world only saw
 through a veil of 'magical and compulsive imaginings' as
certain ethnologists have supposed, or that their thinking
was 'alogical' or 'pre-logical'. Stones were just as hard as
today, fire was just as hot, and natural laws just as
inexorable. Man always thought logically, even if, apart
from sensory data and indeed through them, he was wont
also to take into account realities of a different order.
Logic belongs to the essence of man, and its decomposi­
tion into compulsive imaginings of partly materialistic,
partly sentimental character is not to be found in 'primi­
tive' peoples, nor even in the most spiritually degenerate
savages, but only in the decadence of an exclusively
town...based culture.
That matter should be conceived of as something com­
pletely cut off from spirit, as is the case in the modern
world both in theory and in practice - and notwithstand­
ing certain contradictory currents of philosophy1 - is in
no wise self-evident. It is the result of a particular mental
development, to which Descartes was the first to give
philosophical expression, without 'inventing' it; in fact
it has been profoundly and organically conditioned by
the general tendency to reduce spirit to mere thought and
to limit it to discursive ratio, which means depriving it of
1 Certain modern theories which seek to understand the development
of inorganic and organic forms as a 'movement' of the Spirit, are
basically nothing other than a continuation of materialism, since to
the Spirit which in its essence is immutable they ascribe a 'becoming' .
                                                                    .57
all supra..mental significance, and therefore also of all
cosmic presence or immanence.
According to Descartes spirit and matter are tvvo com..
pletely separate realities, which thanks to divine ordina..
tion come together only at one point: the human brain.
Thus the material world, known as 'matter', is auto­
matically deprived of any spiritual content, while the
spirit, for its part, becomes the abstract counterpart of
the same purely material reality, for what it is in itself,
above and beyond this, remains unspecified.
For men of earlier ages matter was like an aspect of God.
In the cultures which are commonly called archaic, this
perspective was immediate and linked with sensory
experience, for the symbol of matter was the earth. The
latter represented, in its perennial reality, the passive
principle of all visible things, whereas heaven represented
the active and generating principle. The two principles
are like the two hands of God. They are related to one
another as male and female, as father and mother, and
cannot be separated from one another - for in whatever
the earth produces Heaven is present as creative power,
while the Earth, for its part, gives form and body to the
heavenly law. Thus the archaic way of looking at things
was 'sensible' and spiritual at one and the same time, for
the metaphysical truth lying behind it remains independent
of the simple world-picture in question.
For the philosophia perennis, which until the arrival of
rationalism was common to both East and West, the two
principles, the active and the passive, are, beyond all
visible manifestation, the first and all-determining poles
of existence. In this view, matter remains an aspect or
function of God. It is not something separated from spirit,
but its necessary complement. In itself it is no more than
the potentiality of taking on form, and all perceptible
i:;8
  objects in it bear the stamp of its active counterpart, the
  Spirit or Word of God.
  It is only for modern man that matter has become a thing
  and no longer the completely passive mirror of the Spirit.
 Matter has become more compact, so to say, in that it
 now claims for itself alone the quality of spatial extension,
 and everything connected with the latter. It has become
 inert mass, as opposed to the free Spirit. It is completely
 outward and spiritually impenetrable. It is mere fact.
 True, even for the people of earlier ages corporeal matter
 possessed this contingent and relatively unspiritual aspect,
 but this aspect did not make the same claim to sole
 reality. Above all, it was never regarded as something
 that could be studied on its own, independently of spirit.
 The view that spatial extension is the distinguishing
 characteristic of matter was first given philosophic expres­
sion by Descartes. From his time onwards, matter was
regarded as mass and extension. The result of this was that
men sought to understand all spatial, and finally all
sensibly perceived qualities in a purely quantitative way.
In a c�rtain respect this is possible, namely, in so far as it
may be of advantage in a science devoted exclusively to
the outward manipulation of things. However, neither
spatial extension, nor any other sensibly perceived quality
can be fully exhausted along purely quantitative lines.
As Rene Guenon showed in such a masterly way in his
book The Reign of Q,uantiry (Luzac, London, 1953), there
is no spatial extension which does not have a qualitative
- as well as a quantitative - aspect. One can see this most
easily in the simplest spatial forms, such as the circle, the
triangle, the square, etc. Each of these figures has some­
thing unique about it, qualitatively speaking, which can­
not be subject to purely quantitative comparison. 2 It is,
2   This is true even of numbers, in that each number does not simply
in fact, impossible to reduce the world of sense-perceptions
to quantitative categories, for it would then disintegrate
into pure nothingness! Even the simplest 'thought models'
of empirical science - for example, the models indicating
the structure of atoms or molecules - contain qualitative
elements, or at least depend indirectly on such elements.
One can express the difference between red and blue in
figures by explaining the colours in terms of oscillations
and expressing these in figures; but, a blind man, who
has never had a direct experience of colours, will never
know the essence of red and blue by virtue of these fig­
ures, and the same holds good for the qualitative content of
every other sense perception. Let us imagine a man who
has been deaf and colour-blind from birth, but has
acquainted himself with the scientific account of sounds
and colours. The scientific account will convey to him
neither the essences of sounds and colours, nor the pro­
found di:fference between the two kinds of sense percep­
tion. And what is true of the simplest and most ele­
mentary qualities, applies first and foremost to forms
which are the expression of a living unity. These, by
their very nature, elude not only all measurement and
all counting, but also, and above all, any outlook that
seeks to 'dissect'. It is always possible, of course, to chart,
quantitatively, the frontiers of a particular form, without
comprehending its essence. In the realm of art, no one
would contest this, but it is frequently forgotten that this
also holds good in all other domains. The essence, the
content, the qualitative unity of a thing, can never be
grasped by 'a step-by-step' process of measurement,
represent a quantity, but at the same time an aspect of unity, namely,
duality, trinity, quaternity, etc. The qualitative difference bet\veen
forms can be seen most simply in numerals, and this is why the
Pythagorean doctrine 1ooks on simple numerals as an expression of
archetypes.
60
   but only by a comprehensive and immediate experience
   or 'vision'.
   The qualitative content of things does not belong to
   matter, which is merely a mirror for it, so that it can be
   seen, but not so that it can be altogether limited to the
   material plane. A science based on quantitative analysis,
  which 'thinks through action or acts through concepts'
   (rather than seeing and experiencing integrally and
   directly), must of necessity be blind to the infinitely fruit­
  ful and many..sided essence of things. For such a science,
  what the ancients called the 'form' of a thing (i.e., its
   qualitative content) plays virtually no role. This is the
  reason why science and art, which in the pre-rationalistic
  age were more or. less synonymous, are now completely
  divorced from one another, and also why beauty, for
  modern science, offers not the smallest avenue towards
  knowledge.
  The traditional doctrine which makes a distinction be­
  tween eidos and hyle (or betweenforma and materia) is the
  one which most fully does justice to the fact that things
  have many meanings at different levels and that they
  have quality as well as quantity. The traditional doctrine,
. being truly discriminating, does not simply divide and
  break down, but takes account of the two 'poles' in their
  mutual complementarism. Aristotle gave dialectical ex..
· pression to this doctrine, but he did not 'invent' it, for it
  lies in the nature of things, and corresponds to the spiritual
  outlook of primordial man.
  Form, in the Peripatetic sense of the word, is the syn­
  thesis of the qualities which constitute the essence of a
  thing. Form signifies the intelligible reality of a thing� and
  is quite independent of the thing's material existence.
  One must therefore not confuse 'form' in this sense with
  'form' in the everyday sense of something spatially or
 otherwise limited, any more than one must equate
 'matter', which receives 'form' and gives it finite existence,
 with 'matter' in the modern sense of the term.
 The imagination may be helped to grasp the ideas of
 'form' and 'matter' by the simile of the artist or artisan
 who imparts a certain form, preconceived in his intellect,
 to a material such as clay, wood, stone, or metal, thus
creating a picture or other object. But this remains no
more than a simile, because the artisan's material is not
wholly 'formless'. Even if it is relatively 'unformed', it
nevertheless already has certain properties or qualities -
otherwise clay would not be distinguishable from wood,
or stone from metal. Wholly 'formless' matter can neither
be represented nor imagined, for it is a pure potentiality
 (that of taking on form) and has in itself no discernible
characteristics whatsoever. It can only be known at all in
its relationship with 'form'. Even form, however, cannot
be represented as separate from matter, for every form
which has been revealed already takes part in materia,
and this applies also even for an imagined form, in so far
as the imagination can be said to clothe the spiritual
essence of the form with a kind of mental 'material'.
Because the essence of a form, irrespective of its material
'clothing', always remains the same (in such a way that
one can still call a materially limited form 'form') the
concept is possessed of a certain ambiguity. One must
therefore be ready to recognize that in certain circum..
stances the same word 'form' can be given two opposite
meanings: as the outward 'shape' of a being or a work,
'form', on the 'material' side of things, is opposed to the
spirit or content. As the form--giving cause, however,
which impresses its stamp on matter, 'form' takes its place
on the other side - that of spirit or essence_
When we compare the Cartesian way of looking at
matter with this doctrine, we notice, amongst other things,
that the spatial extension which Descartes ascribes to
matter contradicts the traditional theory, for spatial
extension devoid of any qualitative form is unimaginable.
Even direction itself, as Rene Guenon has shown, 3 is of
qualitative nature. Matter, however, is in itself altogether
without form. All that it has is quantity, pure quantity
undetermined by any finite number, which as such can­
not be grasped in any way. It corresponds, as Guenon
has also pointed out, to the materia signata quantitate, which
the scholastics regarded as the basis of the corporeal
world. That is to say, it does not correspond to materia
prima, devoid as it is of every attribute, but only to the
relative materia secunda, determined towards the corporeal
world. Of materia prima, the primordial substance, one
can only say that it is purely receptive with regard to the
form-giving cause of existence and that at the same time
it is the root of 'otherness', for it is through it that things
are limited and multiple. In the language of the Bible,
materia prima is represented by the waters, over which, at
the beginning of creation, the Spirit of God moved.
Just as materia, when one seeks to grasp it, eludes every
advance of the reason and retreats into the passive pole
of existence, so the essential form (forma) may be traced
back to the active pole of existence, by successively strip­
ping it of every layer of manifestation that is conditioned
by any materia, be it ever so fine. Aristotle, who traces
back the two concepts (forma and materia or eidos and hyle)
only so far as their ontology may still be demonstrated
logically, does not reach the threshold where their
opposition paradoxically dissolves into a higher unity.
However, it is clear that the form-giving cause, corre-

sponding to Pure Act, and the receptive substance, which
is purely passive, complement one another reciprocally;
and thus, as fundamental and timeless possibilities, they
cannot be separated from one another. This reference of
all appearances to two primary poles does not of course
abolish the miraculousness of creation; it is merely a
question of marking its outermost perceptible limits.
The active pole can also be referred to in a general way




Plate 3      Two CANDLESTICKS FROM THE GRAVE OF Sr
BERNWARD, bishop of Hildesheim (993-102 2). St Bernward,
the tutor of Otto III, the son of the Byzantine princess Theophano,
founded, as bishop, workshops for metallurgy, goldsmithry, cal­
ligraphy and painting.
On the pedestals of the two candlesticks found in his grave there ·
is written: 'Bernwardus Praesul candelabrum hoc puerum suum
primo hujus Artis flare non auro, non argento, et tamen, ut cernis,
con.flare inbebat' ( The Superior, Bernward, in the first blossoming
of this art, ordered his apprentice to cast this candlestick neither in
silver nor in gold, but nevertheless, as thou seest, to cast it). The
two candlesticks consist of an alloy of silver with copper and iron;
the surface shows signs of gilding.
The pedestal of both candlesticks consists of three pairs of entwined
dragons on which naked men are riding. The vine tendrils around
the shaft spring from the jaws of a lion. Men climb up on these,
and birds sit on them. The candle piece is held by salamanders. The,
pairs of dragons represent the two primal psychic powers in their
untamed, chaotic state. Thf:Y correspond to the caduceus. The vine
which sprouts from the mouth of the solar lion is a primordial
symbol of life, as is a spring of water issuing forth from a leonine
mask. From the Christian point of view it is also a symbol of the
word of God. The salamander is the animal offire.

 as 'essence', and the passive pole as 'substance'. In a
 certain sense essence corresponds to the Spirit or Intellect,
inasmuch as the formae or essential predeterminations of
things are contained in the Divine Intellect as 'prototypes'
or 'archetypes'.
One might here object that the idea of 'form' cannot be
enlarged in an 'upward' direction without abolishing the
distinction betw'een 'formal' and 'supra-formal, mani­
festation - that is to say, the distinction between the
'individual' realm and the 'universal' realm which is that
of the one Spirit. To this it may be answered that the
term 'formal' can only be applied to that something
which, by means of a form, is 'imprinted' on a substance.
In itself form can be looked on not only as a limitation or
outline, but also as a 'bundle' of qualities not 'substan­
tially, or 'materially' determined. In this last sense it can
be applied right up to the unitary aspects of Being. Indeed
in the writings of the medieval theologians of all three
monotheistic religions one comes across the expression
'the form of God' (forma Dei; in Arahie 1¥-iuratu 'l-ilahiyah)
for the totality of divine qualities. The 'essence' of God,
which reveals itself through these qualities, is in Itself
unconditioned and above all qualities.

 In his book The Sceptical Chymist, published in 1661,
·Robert Boyle attacked the traditional doctrine of the
 four elements as the foundations of all corporeal materia.
 He demonstrated that earth, water, an.cl air are not
 indivisible bodies but are composed of various chemical
 constituents. He believed that by so doing he had
 destroyed alchemy in its very roots. What he actually
 shattered, however, was not true alchemy but a crude and
badly understood conception of the traditional doctrine
of the four elements, for true alchemy never regarded
 earth, water, air, and fire as corporeal or chemical sub­
 stances in the present-day sense of the word. The four
elements are simply the primary, and most general,
qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely
 quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself
in differentiated form. The immutable essence of each
element has likewise nothing to do with any corporeal
indivisibility, and in reality the fact that water is com•
posed of hydrogen and oxygen and air of oxygen and
nitrogen in no wise alters the immediate experience of
four fundamental 'conditions' of corporeal materia, of
which earth, water, air, and fire are the most general
examples. Even the chemical constituents into which
the first three items can be broken down fall themselves
into these categories. A certain difficulty in understanding
the doctrine concerning the four elements may arise from
the fact that while these four 'modes of manifestation'
are on the one hand a primary qualitative differentiation
of materia, they nevertheless, as far as their relationship to
 actual bodies is concerned, play the role of passive and
formable substances. In this last respect, namely as
material or substantial foundations, the four elements
can be compared - as was done by ar-Raz1 (Rhazes), for
example - with more or less dense states of corporeal
66
substances, or even more so with various types of vibra­
tions, though all of these similes are only approximately
adequate, for the element as such remains beyond (or
beneath) corporeal manifestation, just as the materia
of the whole corporeal world is itself not perceptible.
From all this one can see that an alchemy which is con­
scious of its cosmological foundations could not have
believed that it was by chemical procedures that the four
elements were reducible to each other, and to their
common underlying substance - as the Hermetic art
taught. If this teaching were indeed followed in its true
meaning, it could only lead away from the outward
empirical level into a completely other ontological 'dimen­
sion'. According to both Western and Eastern alchemists
the elements are never present in bodies in their pure
form. Each corporeal substance contains all four elements,
with one or other preponderating and thus imprinting
its character on the corporeal appearance. Thus ordinary
water is not identical with the element of the same name,
although it is its most immediate manifestation, and at
the same time is one in essence both with it and with the
passive aspect of primordial or universal substance. The
fact that everywhere throughout the various levels of
existence there are 'vertical' links with universal proto­
types means that the cosmological view of nature - and
also every art based on it - possesses a hierarchically
arranged multiplicity of meanings.
The common basis of the four elements, when one looks
at things in general and in a 'synthetic' manner, is none
other than the materia prima of the world. Looking at things
more exactly, however, the elements do not proceed
directly from materia prima but from its first determination,
ether, which fills all space equally, and which in alchemi­
cal writings is referred to either as a materia or as a quinta
                                                           fi-,
essentia - depending on whether it is viewed materially or
qualitatively.
The .fullest explanation of the four elements is to be found
in the Hindu cosmology of sankhya. According to this
the corporeal elements or bhutas, which pertain to the
material world in the broadest sense of the term, are
matched by the same number of 'essential measures' or
tanmdtras which are contained in the cognitive subject.
Both groups of primordial determinations., the tanmdtras as
well as the bhutas, derive ultimately from prakriti (materia
prima). They are filtered through ahankara, the principium
individuationis or ego-consciousness, and divided into the
objective and subjective poles of the manifested world.
This explanation of the elements corresponds exactly to
the Hermetic view. It also shows how visible appearances
can be transposed into the inward realm, for the same
tanmdtras also 'measure' psychic phenomena.
If the elements are listed in the order of their material
'fineness' or 'subtlety' ., earth comes lowest, and air highest.
If, however, they are ordered according to the directions
of their movement, fire occupies the highest place.
Earth is characterized by heaviness: it possesses a down­
ward tendency. Water is likewise 'heavy', but also has
the capacity of 'extension'. Air both rises and extends,
whereas fire rises exclusively.
According to Hermetic tradition the natural order of the
elements is represented either by a cross, whose central
point then corresponds to the quinta essentia, or by con­
centric circles, in which case earth is the middle point,
and fire the outermost circle. Again, it may be repre­
sented by the individual parts of the 'Seal of Solomon',
which consists of two intersecting equilateral triangles.
The triangle pointing upwards 6 corresponds to fire, and
the triangle pointing downwards     v     corresponds to water.
68
The triangle representing fire, with the horizontal side
of the other triangle, represents air f:5., while the upturning
of this sign represents earth ¾2'. The complete seal of
Solomon ¢ represents the synthesis of all elements and
thus the union of all opposites.

                              *

The traditional view of materia as the passive and receptive
ground of all multiplicity and differentiation, makes it
 possible to apply the same concept outside the corporeal
domain. Thus one may speak of a materia of the soul, given
that the psychic world also consists of a multiple and
changing 'imprinting' of essential forms, and thus possesses
an active (or essential) and a passive (or substantial or
'material') pole.
The substantial pole of the soul, in other words its materia,
is expressed in its capacity to take on and to maintain
forms, that is to say, in its pure and illimitable 'recep..
tivity'. That is its feminine side - and one may take this
almost literally, for in the nature of woman this aspect of
the soul predominates and even shows itself physically.
In woman soul and body are relatively close to one an..
other as a result of the 'passive' characteristics common
to both - a fact which ennobles the body but binds the
soul.
The 'forms' taken on by the 'substance' or 'material'
of the soul come from without as well as from within.
This means that empirically they come from without,
through the senses. They are essential forms only in so
far as they correspond to the immutable prototypes con..
tained in the Intellect, which constitute the real content
of all knowledge. The essential pole of the soul is thus the
Intellect (or Spirit). It is its 'form'. This expression may
                                                           fin
  well sound peculiar. It must not be taken to mean that
  the Intellect in itself has any particular 'form'. If indeed
  the term 'essential form' can be applied to the Intellect,
  this is only so because in its action on the materia of a given
 soul it 'imprints' the 'personal form' of the soul, and so,
 along with the latter, forms the personal being. For the
 same reasons - that is, having regard to the interrelation-­
 ship of spirit and soul, anµ because the qualitative
 uniqueness of the person comes from the Spirit - it is
 possible to speak of the 'spirit' of a particular being, or of
 'spirits' in the plural. Thus it is in the case of a light, of
 which a ray - or a bundle of rays - is intercepted by a
 reflecting surface: light in itself has no particular direction,
 it spreads out into the whole of space. In its relationship
to the reflecting surface, however, it has a direction, and ,
seems, without any essential change of nature, as if it
were a ray. So it is that everything that is spirit, is 'made
of knowledge' and wholly one with the Light of Truth.
And yet when the Spirit is present in the soul, it appears
as an individual being.
As spirit and soul cannot be circumscribed like two cor-­
poreal things, every simile that one may use to convey
their reciprocal relationship is somehow too simple and
too crude. Nevertheless such similes convey much more
than attempted psychological descriptions, which of
necessity relate everything to the psychic plane alone,
with the result that the spiritual pole is only perceived
indirectly, as a particular aspect of the psychic world.
This is the case, for example, in the psychological distinc..
tion between animus and anima, which has but the remotest
connection with the true relationship between spirit and
soul, as is shown by the fact (amongst other things) that
animus receives a 'rational' slant. In reality it is only a
psychic and passive reflection of the Spirit.
70
 In his book On the Adornment.of the Spiritual Marriage (Book
 II, chapter 4), Ruysbroek writes: 'In all men there is by
 nature a threefold unity, .which moreover in the case of
 the just is supernatural. The first and highest unity to be
 found in men is God, for all creatures depend on Divine
 Unity for their very being, life, and existence. If they
 could dissolve this relationship, they would fall into
 nothingness and be annihilated. This unity is in us essen­
 tially by nature, whether we be good or bad. Without
our co-operation it makes us neither holy nor happy.
 While this unity is in us, it is at the same time above us, as
the foundatio7:1 and support of our life.
 'A second union, or unity, is likewise present in us by
nature. This is the unity of the higher faculties, a unity
which derives from the fact that, as regards their activity,
these faculties spring naturally from the unity of the
Spirit itself. It "is still that same unity which we possess
in God, but here it is regarded from the active side, and
not from the point of view of essence. The Spirit is just as
much present in the one unity as in the other, in all the
fullness of its being. This second unity we possess in our­
selves, quite above the realm of the senses� From it derive
thought, reason, will and all the possibilities of spiritual
activity. Here the soul bears the name of spirit.
'The third unity which is in us by nature consists of the
domain of the lower faculties, which have their seat in
the heart, the basis and source of animal life. It is in the
body, and especially in the action of the heart that the
soul possesses this unity, from which all activities of
the body and the five senses proceed. Here it bears its
own name of soul, for it is the "form" of the body
which it apimates, the body which it makes to live and
keeps alive ..
'These three unities which are in man by nature consti-
                                                           ,.,T
 tute a single life and a single realm. In its lowest unity this
 life is sensory and animal; in the middle unity it is
 rational and spiritual; and in the highest unity it is con­
 tained in its own essence. This belongs to all men by
 nature ... '
 Ruysbroek characterizes the soul in the literal sense of
 the word (anima, psyche), by its tendency towards the
 sensory faculties, by which he means the level of the ego-­
 bound empirical soul in contradistinction from the spirit.
 But the relationship spirit-soul can also be looked at in
 another way. When we speak of the soul as the materia of
the spirit, we do not mean the mere tissue of ego-conscious­
ness, but rather the passive and receptive capacity which
lies much deeper and which, precisely, is veiled by the
habitual attachment of the soul to the senses. That the
soul as ego should be confounded with the body makes
it fragmentary and in a certain sense 'congealed', and this
prevents it from mirroring the Spirit freely and without
distortion.
What corresponds to the chaotic soul on the mineral plane
is the condition of base metal, especially lead which in its
obscurity and heaviness resembles crude mass. According
to the famous Moslem mystic Muhyi 'd-Din ibn fArabi,
gold corresponds to the sound and original condition of
the soul which freely and without distortion reflects the
Divine Spirit in its essence, whereas lead corresponds to
its 'sick', distorted, and 'dead' condition, which no longer
reflects the Spirit. The true essence of lead is gold. Each
base metal represents a break in the equilibrium which
gold alone exhibits.
In order to free the soul from its coagulation and paralysis,
its essential form and its materia must be dissolved out of
their crude and one-sided combination. It is as if spirit
and soul had to be separated from one another, in order,
72
 after their 'divorce', to become 'married' again. The
 amorphous materia is burnt, dissolved, and purified, in
order finally to be 'coagulated' anew in the form of a
perfect crystaL
The form of the soul thus - 'born again' is nevertheless
 distinguishable from the all-embracing Spirit, as it still
belongs to conditioned existence. But at the same time it
is transparent to the undifferentiated Light of the Spirit
and in vital union with the primordial materia· of all souls;
for the 'material' or 'substantial' ground of the soul, just
like its essential or active ground, has a unitary nature.
That all souls are 'made of one substance' can be knovVtl
from the fact that the 'movements' (emotions) of the
souls of all living creatures - in spite of the immense
variety of species and levels of consciousness - proceed in
a similar fashion. One could say that they are like the
waves of the same sea.
Alchemical doctrine and symbolism never have the com­
plete (spiritual) 'extinction' of the individual in view, as
have such concepts as the Hindu mokska, the Buddhist
nirvana, the Sufi.fand'u 'l-:fana'i, and likewise the Christian
unio mystica or deificatio in the highest meaning of these last
two expressions. This is because alchemy is based on a
purely cosmological vision and therefore can only be
transposed indirectly to the metacosm.ic or divine realm.
Since, however, alchemical realization can represent a
stage on the way to that highest of all goals, it has never­
theless been incorporated into Christian and Islamic
mysticism. Alchemical transmutation brings the centre
of human consciousness into direct contact with that
divine ray which irresistibly attracts the soul upwards and
lets it savour by anticipation the Kingdom of Heaven.
 The application of the mutually complementary concepts
fonna and materia to the realm of the soul makes it clear in
 what sense certain sensible data such as the four elements
 are to be transposed onto the psychic plane. Just like the
 corporeal materia, which manifests itself most readily in
 the four elements, so the materia of the soul, in its deploy­
 ment, has several mutually opposing tendencies. It has a
 tendency 'downwards', towards inertia and earthy dense­
 ness. At the same time it has a tendency 'upwards' like
 the element fire, towards the Spirit. Again it has a
 tendency towards expansion - either passive and rela­
 tively inert, like that of water, or more active and mobile,
like that of air. As applied to the soul, 'earth' is that aspect
or tendency which causes it to sink into the body and which
attaches it to the latter. 'Fire' has the same purifying and
transmuting character as outward fire. 'Water' is capable
of assuming all forms.. In its original and uncorrupted
nature water is, in the words of St Francis of Assisi, umile
e pre;:,iosa e casta ('humble and precious and chaste'). For
the soul, 'air', free and mobile, envelops all forms of
consciousness.
The signs of the four elements derived from the Seal of
Solomon are particularly lucid when it comes to their
application to the soul. From them, it can be seen that
the plurality of the elements derives from the opposition
of fire � and water 'V, that is, from the pair activity­
passivity (which of course corresponds to the pair forma­
materia). It is the same opposition which we shall later
encounter in the form of sulphur and quicksilver. Through
the union of opposites (:K the soul becomes 'fluid fire' and
'fiery water', and at the same. time also acquires the
positive qualities of the other elements, so that its water
becomes 'stable' and its fire 'non-burning'; for the 'fire'
of the soul is that which confers stability on its 'water',
while the 'water' of the soul confers on 'fire' the mildness
and ubiquity of 'air'.
The 'inward elements' may also be considered as pure
qualities of the spirit, and ultimately as immutable aspects
of Being. Seen in this way, their union and reconciliation
consists in the fact that in each individual elemental
quality_ the others are also contained, for Pure Being is
both simple and inexhaustibly rich. The highest meaning
of alchemy is the knowledge that all is contained in all,
and its magisterium is none other than the realization of this
truth on the plane of the souL This realization is effected
by means of the creation of the 'elixir', which unites in
itself all the powers of the soul, and thus acts as a trans-­
muting 'ferment' on the psychic world and, in an indirect
fashion, on the outward world also.
As there is no corporeal substance that is completely cut
off from the higher modes of being it is possible in certain
circumstances to transpose powers pertaining to the soul
or spirit onto a corporeal substance, so that in a certain
way they become attached to it. Thus the inward elixir
of the alchemists may in some cases have an outward
counterpart.

               PLANETS AND METALS

The alchemists designate the various metals by the same
symbols as those which they attribute to the planets and
indeed often give both metals and planets the same names.
For gold they say 'sun', for silver 'moon', for quicksilver
'Mercury', for copper 'Venus', for iron 'Mars', for tin
'Jupiter', and for lead 'Saturn'. The correspondences
thus established clearly demonstrate the relationship be­
tween alchemy and astrology, a relationship based on
that law which the 'Emerald Tablet' expresses in the
words : 'Whatever is below is like that which is above.,
Astrology and alchemy, which in their Western form
both derive from the Hermetic tradition, are related to
one another as heave.n and earth. Astrology interprets the
meaning of the zodiac and the planets, and alchemy the
meaning of the elements and the metals. The twelve signs
of the zodiac are a simplified picture of the archetypes
immutably contained in the Divine Intellect. The ele­
ments fire, air, water, and earth, on the other hand,
symbolically manifest the first and fundamental differ­
entiation of primordial substance (materia prima, hyle).
Whereas the planets, by virtue of ·their positions in
relation to one another, manifest in differentiated and
temporal mode the possibilities contained in the zodiac,
and thus represent the ways of action of the Divine
Spirit 'descending' from Heaven to earth, the metals for
their part represent the first fruits of elemental substance, 1
'ripened' by the Spirit or Intellect.
1 Expressed more synthetically, metal is a spiritual manifestation of
corporeal materia, whereas the planets, or the stars in general, repre�
sent a corporeal manifestation of the Spirit. The relationship of
Alchemy teaches that the metals were generated in the
dark womb of the earth under the influence of the seven
planets - that is, sun, moon, and the five planets visible
to the naked eye. This way of looking at things must not
be regarded as a physical explanation. It indicates how
material manifestations derive - essentially, but not
physically - from the two principal poles of existence.
In the complementary regimes of stars and metals, there
is a kind of ontological scale, to which all aspects of
nature can be related. This is true not only in the case of
'outward' nature, the macrocosm, but also for the micro..
cosm, that is to say, the psycho-physical constitution of
man. Just as in alchemy there are 'inward' metals, so in
astrology there are 'inward' planets.
A certain variability in the pairing of metals and planets
arises from the fact that some alchemical schools regard
mercury, because of its 'volatility' and its effect on other
metals, not as a metal or 'body', but as a volatile agent or
'spirit'. In such cases a metal other than quicksilver takes
its place in the seven.. runged ladder - sometimes an alloy.
What is essential is that each of the seven metals repre­
sents a definite 'type', which includes a whole group of
mutually related metals. 2
The duality of the active and receptive poles of existence
expressed in the complementarism of heaven and earth,
or of planets and metals, is reflected within each of the
two groups in the relationship of sun and moon, and of
gold and silver. The sun, or gold, is in a certain sense the
incarnation of the active and generative pole of existence,
planets and metals is the same as that expressed in the Arab proverb:
'The beauty of man is in his intelligence, and the intelligence of woman
is in her beauty.' The planets are embodied intelligence; the metals
intelligent bodies.
2 For some Hellenistic alchemists electrum takes the place of quick­

silver.
                                                                     ,.,,.,
whereas the moon or silver incarnates the receptive pole,
the materia prima. Gold is sun; sun is spirit. Silver, or moon,
is soul.
The other metals, and the other planets, participate to
varying degrees in the two poles of existence. Neither
pole is manifested entirely in any one of them.
The gradation of cosmic qualities - manifested actively
in the planets, and passively in the metals - is clearly
expressed in the seven signs which stand for both planets
and metals. These are listed here in the order of the
planetary orbits as seen from the point of view of the
earth:
    )                            0        0       4        )
Moon     Mercury       Venus    Sun    Mars   Jupiter   Saturn
silver   quicksilver   copper   gold   iron   tin       lead

In contradistinction from the usual way of representing
the sign for Mars - as a circle with an arrow i (a form
which deviates completely from the style of the other
signs) - Mars is here represented by a circle with a cross
above it. We may suppose that Mars was earlier desig­
nated in this way and that the now more usual sign was
introduced in order to distinguish it from that of Venus in
charts of the heavens without a clear indication of top
and bottom. The use of the earlier sign for Mars (o) as a
designation of the earth only arose with the heliocentric
world picture, and is nothing other than the Christian
symbol of the globe surmounted by the cross.
Thus the seven planetary signs are formed from three
basic figures: the circle, the semicircle, and the cross.
As the circle is also the sign for the sun, and the semi­
circle for the moon, these two figures can be regarded as
representations of the complete and of the half orbits of
the sun respectively. Their spiritual interpretation is in
no wise altered thereby, as the half orbit of the sun, which
,.,�
  measures one of the two phases of the year, is contained
  in the whole, just as the light of the moon proceeds
  entirely from the sun. The third basic figure, the cross,
  recalls, astronomically speaking, the cross of the four
  directions of space, and, alchem.ically speaking, the four
 elements. Inscribed in one another, the three basic
 figures give rise to the 'wheel of Heaven': Ef).
 Thus, in the seven signs, we find an expression of the
 whole - cosmic hierarchy which was mentioned above.
 This hierarchy is the result of the polarization of existence
·into an active or masculine pole 0 and a passive or
 feminine pole ), and its genesis is due to the fact that the
 influence of the former on the latter (which plays the role
 of plastic materia) is to imprint conditions on the latter
 which 'cross-cut' one another +. That sun and moon
 correspond to the two poles of existence can be seen both
 in the relationship between a source of light and the sur­
 face that reflects it, and in the fact that the form of the
 moon changes, whereas that of the sun always remains
the same. Becoming belongs to the passive side, while
 the Pure Act of the Essence remains motionless. The
third basic figure of the planetary signs, the cross, is the
 most general of the symbols which represent the differ­
entiation (under the influence of the active pole) of the
possibilities latent in passive materia. It is the cross of the
four elements.
It is important to remember that the sun, or gold, is not
the active pole as such, but only its principal reflection
within a given realm. The same is true of the moon, or
silver, which corresponds to the passive pole. Strictly
speaking, the symbol of the passive pole has no form of
its own, as materia prima is without form. It can thus only
be the complement or the fragmentation of the symbol of
the active pole, which is why the semicircle, the crescent
                                                           "7n
   moon, or the half solar orbit, symbolizes the passive cause.
  Thus it is that gold unites in itself all 'metallic light' or all
  'colour', while silver, like a mirror, is colourless.
  The planets (except sun and moon), and the base metals,
  are variations on a single prototype, which is incarnated
  wholly only in the sun and in gold. In them either the
  solar or the lunar cause is predominant - without, how­
  ever, achieving full expression, for the varying combina­
  tions of circle or semicircle with the cross indicate a
  certain rupture of the original equilibrium of the elements.
  Every rupture of this equilibrium (depending on whether,
  in its sign, the solar or lunar figure is located above, below,
  or on the horizontal arm of the cross) is associated with a
  different quality. Thus in the sign "j for Saturn or lead,
  the crescent is attached to the lower arm of the cross, at
  the lowest point, so to say, of the material order - lead,
  in fact, being the densest and most 'chaotic' of metals. In
  the sign for Jupiter 2. the crescent is attached to the
  horizontal arm. From the alchemical point of view this
  corresponds to tin's middle position between lead and
  silver. A sign with the crescent on the topmost point of the
  cross does not exist. It would be synonymous with the
  sign for the moon, for, where the lunar cause is entirely
  predominant, it dissolves the elemental differentiations,
  materia prima being pure, unformed receptivity, like water.
  On the other hand there is a sign (that of Venus or
  copper �) in which the sun appears above the cross, for
, the active, form-giving cause does not dissolve the ele­
  mental differentiations, but, rather, reinforces them,
  before bringing them to perfect equilibrium in the form of
  gold. According to Basilius Valentinus copper contains an
  excess of unfixed sun ...power like a tree which has too much
  resin. Its opposite - both as regards its sign and its nature
          o;
  - is iron in it the sun is to be found under the cross and
   thus hidden in the darkness of the earth: In the geocentric
   world-picture Ivfars o and Venus � stand closest to one
   another; they are the mythological pair of lovers.
   One single si gn, that of Mercury or quicksilver, contains
   all three basic figures: the cross, the circle, and the semi­
   circle. In it the lunar cause predominates over the solar
  which, for its part, 'fixes' the cross of the elemental pairs
  of opposites. We shall return frequently to this sign, for it
  is the true key to the alchemical work, just as Mercury or
  Hermes is the ancestor of alchemy. In the meantime let
  it merely be said that this sign, and the metal to which it
  corresponds, expresses materia prima as the bearer of all
  forms. Quicksilver is likewise the 'womb' of all metals,
 while silver resembles the virginal condition of pure
 materia prima. This also explains why the alchemists
 represent the 'material' or feminine cause - materia - in
 so far as it enters into their works by both the moon (or
 silver) and by quicksilver. The latter corresponds to the
 'productive' power of materia, its 'dynamic' aspect, just as
 sulphm: - the 'opposite' of quicksilver - is the active power
 of the solar or masculine cause. In a certain sense the
 Chinese theory regarding sun and moon can be applied
 to gold and silver: the sun, say the Chinese, is congealed
yang, and the moon congealed yin. Likewise gold is con..
gealed or static 'sulphur', and silver is congealed 'quick­
silver'. It is hardly necessary to remark that all these
relationships must not be understood in a physical sense,
but on the background of a cosmology which goes beyond
the corporeal domain.
The series of seven signs for plant;:ts and metals can be
regarded as a simplified representation of a given cosmo­
logical domain. In every domain there is what may be
called a centre, that is to say, a qualitative high..point in
which the prototype or cause, which governs the whole
                                                           81
domain, reveals itself most immediately and fully. Such is
gold amongst metals, the jewel amongst stones, the rose
or the lotus amongst flowers, the lion amongst quad­
rupeds, the eagle amongst birds, and man amongst all
living creatures on earth. In each case the 'central' mani­
festation is 'noble', because, as a symbol, it is as complete
and integral as possible. Contrariwise, the 'peripheric'
manifestations are more or less 'base', in so far as they
express only incidental qualities or aspects of the one
prototype. 3
Here it should be noted that while man in his specific
nature always symbolically represents the centre of the
earthly realm, this is not necessarily so with regard to his
individuality. The animal always remains true to the
essential form of his species. In a passive way he partici­
pates in that ray of the Divine Intellect which reveals
itself in him through his very existence. (The so-called
'instinct' of the animals pertains to this passive partici­
pation in the Intellect.) Man, on the other hand, is
created for the purpose of participating actively in the
Divine Intellect, of which he is the 'central' reflection.
Only when he does so is he truly the centre of the earthly
state, and even, in proportion to his identification with
the Intellect, of the whole of formal manifestation or of
the whole cosmos. The 'realization' of the centre of the
earthly state is the real goal of alchemy, and also the
deepest meaning of gold. Gold is a 'body' like other
metals, b.ut the mass, density and divisibility of bodies
8
  It should nevertheless be understood that only a complete domain
of existence has an unequivocal centre; thus man is the unequivocal
centre of the whole of the earthly state. On the other hand, partial
domains have no more than relative centres, which are frequently
manifested in varied and mutually complementary forms. Thus in
the realm of birds, besides the eagle, there is the nightingale ,. and also
the dove and the peacock, or again the swan and the owl, each of
which, in its respective fashion, manifests a 'centre'.
82
have in it been transmuted into pure, symbolical quality.
It is incarnated light. The alchemists themselves often
describe the goal of their work as a 'volatilization of the
solid and a solidification of the volatile' or as a 'spiritual­
ization of the body and an embodiment of the spirit'. Gold
is nothing else than this.
Only in the sign for gold is the midpoint of the circle
represented, which indicates that in gold alone does the
essential unity of the prototype with its material reflection
find expression. Likewise, it is only in perfect man that
the similarity of the creature with God becomes spiritually
effective.
                               *
In the words of the 'Emerald Tablet' - according to which
whatever is below is like that which is above, and what­
ever is ahove is like that which is below - there is a refer­
ence to a mirror-like inversion of the two sides. In reality
the 'gradation' of the metals (according to their greater
or lesser similarity to gold) is inverse to that of the planets,
which enjoy a higher rank the further their orbit is from
the earth-centre. An exception here is the sun, which
corresponds to gold, and whose sphere is in the middle
between tvvo sets of three planetary orbits. Above the sun,
from below upwards, are the orbits of Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn. Beneath it, in descending order towards the earth,
are the orbits of Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. If, up­
wards and outwards, one adds the fixed stars to the
planetary spheres, then the series must be completed,
downwards and in the direction of the centre, by the
addition of the earth. In one way or another, even in the
geocentric world-picture, the sun represents a centre,
quite apart from the fact that, as the source of light for
all the planets, it is already their centre.
The combination of the two symbolic orders (in which,
on the one hand, the greater or lesser breadth of 'the
heavens' is paramount, and on the other the central
position of the sun), also crops up in the application of
the planetary qualities to the human being. Here it
acquires a meaning which is particularly instructive as
far as the world-picture common to both alchemy and
cosmology is concerned.
Saturn, whose orbit is the widest from the point of view
of the earth, corresponds to intelligence, or more exactly,
to the intellect, while the moon, whose orbit is nearest to
the earth-centre, is analogous to the 'vital spirit' which
binds soul and body to each other. These are the two
outermost poles of the soul's capacity, for the vital spirit,
which governs the involuntary activities of the body, such
as growth and digestion, and which for this reason has
an 'existential' rather than a 'rational' character, is in a
certain sense opposed to the intellect. Between these two
 outermost poles, the other faculties of the soul are ranged.
 These are variously designated and related to the planets,
 depending on whether the side of 'knowledge' or of 'will'
is taken the more into account. In every case the sun
corresponds to a faculty which lies midway between the
 two poles and in a sense unites them. According to Macro­
bius (who, in his commentary on Scipio's dream, con­
siders the hierarchy of the planets in connection with the
Pythagorean-Orphic doctrine of the descent of the soul
from outermost heaven to earth), the sun is analogous to
the faculty which animates the five senses and synthesizes
their impressions. The sun is thus the prototype of the life
of the 'sensory soul'. According to another and more
profound view of things, that of eAbd al-Karim al-Jili,
for example, in his book on 'Universal Man' (al-insdn al­
kamil),4 the sun is analogous to the heart (al-qalb), the
organ of intuitive, unitive knowledge, which completely
transcends all other faculties of the soul. Just as the sun
gives the planets their light, so the light of the heart (seat
of the spirit or intellect) illumines all other faculties of the
soul.
'Intelligence' is here used to translate ratio in the old (and
not in the 'rationalistic') sense of the word (Greek: nous;
Arabic: al-' aql). As the faculty of fundamental and com­
prehensive thought, intelligence in this sense - or the
human intellect - is related to the all-comprehending
Divine Intellect. In the Divine Intellect, however, the
two aspects 'Knowledge' and 'Being' are both present,
whereas in the human intellect there is the aspect 'know­
ledge' alone, for in a certain sense the human intellect is
separate from what it knows. The wider and more com­
prehensive its vision, the more it is detached from its

object. The 'vital spirit', on the other hand, is (subjectively
and according to common experience) unreservedly
immersed in corporeal existence. These are the two
outermost limits of ego-bound or individual consciousness,
and it may well be said that this consciousness is split
between mind (now) and body. The Cartesian cogito ergo
sum ('I think, therefore I am') is immediately refuted by
the fact that thinking is not capable of grasping its own
being. The utterance 'I am' is either the expression of a
transcendent and ever-present certitude infinitely above
all thought, or merely of the common experience of
individual corporeal existence, which does no more than
passively accompany thought, however much it may be
swathed in a whole network of imaginings. Knowledge
and being are reflected separately in individual conscious..
ness as mind and body. To escape this duality, con­
sciousness must return to the 'sun' of the heart. As the
alchemists say, 'body' must again become 'spirit', and
'spirit' 'body'.
Of the other planets, Jupiter is usually compared to the
faculty of decision (Arabic: al-lJ,immah). It thus represents
the spiritual or intellectual form of the will. To Mars
belongs courage; Al-Jm: also attributes to it 'active
imagination' (al-wahm). Both attributes are related to the
'demiurgic', world-bent will. According to Macrobius and
all the Hellenistic cosmologists, Venus is the star of
amorous passion. For al-Jiu Venus is above all the proto..
type of the 'passive imagination' ( al-khiydl), and is related
to the 'active imagination' of Mars as is wax to a seal.
For all cosmologists Mercury is the prototype of analytical
thought (al-.fikr). To the moon Macrobius attributes the
faculty of generation and bodily movement. This is
defined even more exactly by St Albert the Great as
motus quos movet, in sequendo naturam corporis, ut attrahendo,
  mutuanao, augendo et generando, and these are exactly the
  modes of action of the vital spirit (spiritus vitalis, ar.,.ru. ) ,
  which al-JiH attributes to the moon.
  The hierarchy of planets is descending, and that of the
  corresponding metals, ascending. The former are active,
 the latter passive. As inert material, metal cannot be the
 symbol either of a 'cognitive' or a 'volitive' faculty. Thus,
 because of its static and unformed nature, it is the expres-­
 sion of a similarly static state of consciousness, that is to
 say, of an inward consciousness not bound to mental
 forms. This is none other than the inward consciousness
 of the individual body. It is its 'souJ..form'. From this
 'metal' the alchemist must extract the 'metallic soul' and
 the 'metallic spirit'. The chaotic and 'opaque' bodily
 consciousness, encumbered with passions and habits, is
 'base' metal. In it soul and spirit seem suffocated,
 darkened, mixed with earth. On the other hand, 'illu­
 mined' bodily consciousness ('noble' metal), is itself a
spiritual mode of existence. The soul must first be
extracted from base metal, the alchemists say. The
remaining body is to be purified and burnt until it is no
more than ashes. Then the soul is to be reunited with it.
When the body is thus 'dissolved' in the soul, so that
both constitute a pure materia, the Spirit acts on the soul
and confers on it an incorruptible form. That is to say, it
transmutes individual bodily consciousness back into its
own purely spiritual possibility, where, in all its fullness
and according to its own essence, it remains motionless
and indivisible. Basilius Valentinus compares this state
with the 'glorious body' of the resurrected.
Alongside the planetary hierarchy which is inversely
related to that of the metals, there is also another and
older ordering of the planets which runs parallel to the
alchemical order. This is their gradation according to
    'houses', the distribution of which in the zodiac only
    becomes meaningful when their common axis is situated
    in the way in which, in all probability, it was situated in
    the original zodiac of about two thousand years before

Christ. At that time the axis of the solstice passed between
Leo and Cancer at the upper end, so that) as a result, the
so-called planetary 'houses' became symmetrically ar­
ranged. As Julius Schwabe has shown, 5 there is much to
suggest that this position of the heavens was fundamental
for all astrological symbolism. Furthermore, as the
alchemical meaning of the planetary signs is identical with

QQ
  the astrological, it may be presumed that the same cosmic
  moment also saw the birth of alchemy in the traditional
  form in which it has existed up to modern times.
  Each planet possesses two adjacent 'houses', a left and a
  right, or a feminine and a masculine, with the exception
  of the moon and the sun which have only one house each
  and rule respectively the feminine and the masculine
  halves of the zodiac. In the lowest position of this picture
 of the heavens, on the two sides of the winter solstice, in
 the place of darkness and death, 'dwells' Saturn, which
 corresponds to lead amongst the metals. Its sign 3 shows
 the lunar crescent in the lowest position. Symbolically this
 represents the chaotic immersion of consciousness in the
 body. On the other hand, the sign for Jupiter or tin 2.,
 in which the crescent occupies the next highest position,
 already indicates a first step in the loosing of the soul
from the elemental pairs of opposites. The 'moon' of the
 soul here touches the horizontal bar of the cross, which
signifies cosmic expansion. Immediately under the hori­
zontal middle axis of the whole zodiac lie the two houses
of Mars and immediately above, those of Venus. Their
two signs, o and �' are as mirror images of one another.
The sign for Mars, which corresponds to iron, exhibits a
congealing or a sinking of the spirit into the corporeal.
In the sign for Venus or copper, on the other hand, the
'sun' of the spirit appears above the 'tree' of the elemental
tendencies. The colour of gold becomes visible, but it .is
not yet purified. Over this lie the two houses of Mercury
or quicksilver. Its sign � is the only one which contains
the figures of both sun and moon. Quicksilver contains in
its lunar 'water' the fiery germ of the sun, just as the
original power of the soul bears within it the germ of the
essential Spirit. For the alchemists quicksilver is the
'mother of gold' and the primum agens of their work. Sun
and moon stand opposite one another in their houses at
the top of the zodiac. The moon ) is analogous to the
soul in its state of pure receptivity, and the sun is analogous
to the spirit, or, more exactly, to the soul transmuted and
illumined by the spirit, representing the perfect union of
spirit, soul, and body.
The sun does not merely govern in its own 'house', it also
traverses the whole zodiac, ascending through its 'mascu-

line' side and descending through its 'feminine' side. The
'solstice' between descent and ascent lies in the domain
of Saturn, and, in its leaden 'chaos' the life of the sun and
of gold is hidden.
The alchemical myth of King Gold, who must be killed
and buried, in order that he may awake again to life, and
who, ascending through seven regimes, attains his full
glory, is nothing other than an expression of this astro­
logical symbolism. This symbolism, however, is the cosmic
reflection of an inner law: the divine spark in man corre­
sponds to the sun. It seems to die when the soul enters the
house of Saturn. In truth, however, it arises anew and,
ascending through the seven levels of consciousness,
becomes the 'red lion' - the all-transmuting elixir.

   THE ROTATION OF THE ELEMENTS

 As has been said above, spiritual alchemy was not neces­
 sarily involved in outward metallurgical operations, even
 if it made use of them as similes. It is nevertheless to be
 supposed that originally the inward and the outward work
went hand in hand, for, within the framework of an
 organic civilization orientated towards man's highest
goal, a craft can only have meaning when it serves a
spiritual way. A symbolical form of expression, for its
part, only finds its justification in immediate experience.
It is therefore appropriate at this point to look at some of
 the simplest of the metallurgical processes which at all
times have served as symbolical supports for alchemy.
Apart from purely metallurgical procedures (such as
extracting metal from a mixed or impure ore, smelting it,
and, if necessary, combining it with another metal, in
order to make good its specific defects) there is also the
production of those chemical substances which act on
metals (either purifying them, or giving them specific
properties such as greater fusibility, greater hardness, or
a particular colour). Among such substances are antimony
and sulphur, as well as quicksilver, which, although a
metal itself, also acts as a solvent on other metals.
As the production and use of these chemicals also come
within the competence of the metallurgist, it will be seen
that the scope of his activities corresponds to all intents
and purposes to that of modern chemistry. This is why
related crafts, such as the production of coloured glass
and artificial precious stones, and the preparation of
dies, were also incorporated into the basically metal..
lurgical tradition of alchemy and its symbolic language.
Famous alchemists, such as J abir ibn Hayyan, Abu Bakr ar­
Razi (died 925), and Geber, mention in their works a whole
series of fundamental operations which, though obviously
chemical in nature, also serve as the symbols of inward pro­
cesses, on account of their general and typical character.
According to Jabir there are four processes which govern
the alchemical work: firstly, the purification of sub•
stances, then their solution, followed by a new coagulation,
and finally their combination. Ar-Razi includes many
more operations - most of them also to be found in Geber's
Summa Perfectionis - of which we shall only mention the
most important here: Volatilization or sublimation served,
as it still does today, to separate an evaporable substance
from a mixture, and so obtain it in its pure state. As is
known, sulphur is produced in this manner. Descension,
on the other hand, was used to separate a fusible substance
(a metal) by draining it off from non-fusible minerals.
Distillation was a filtering of soluble substances. Burning
or calcination changed a metal into a soluble oxide which,
when dissolved (dissolution) could be separated from
insoluble substances mixed with it. It then had to be
brought back to its non..oxidized state by renewed coagu..
lation and reduction. Volatile substances could be 'fixed'
and made stable by fire, and hard substances could be
made wax-like and fusible by incineration. In these
operations, besides purely mineral agents, organic agents
such as oil and urine were also used.
If practical alchemy remained without the analytical
knowledge which is at the disposal of modern chemistry, its
eye, for that very reason, was all the sharper for the qualita­
tive aspects of matter and its transformations. In this respect
its methods were often exceedingly fine, and it is possible
that they sometimes gained access to areas which modern
science leaves out of account. Nature has many faces.
 The most striking symbol is the transformation which one
 single substance can undergo, becoming successively
 liquid, gaseous, and then solid again; or, having been
 crumbly, becomes pliant like wax; or, losing its form in
 solution, it suddenly acquires a new one, this time crystal­
 line; or, in changing its state, it acquires a new colour.
 This capacity for transformation on the part of one single
 substance symbolized more clearly than anything the
 one materia prima of the cosmos, capable of taking on all
possible forms and states, without essential alteration.
 It also threw light on the nature of the soul, which like..
wise exhibits many states and properties, all in some way
belonging to its (not immediately discernible) essence.
Thus in the oven or retort of the alchemists, one can see
in miniature Nature's 'plai (be it either in the corporeal
or the psychic domain).
In interpreting material changes as the expression of a
general law, the alchemists refer, on the one hand, to the
four elements, and, on the other, to the four natural
qualities hot, cold, wet, and dry, which, as nature's modes
of action, are 'active' in their relation to the elements.
The scheme of these relationships had already been
expressed by Aristotle.
The four sensible qualities are thus 'mobile' in relation to
matter, and seem, in fact, to have the capacity of changing
one element into the next: thus it is by heat that water is
absorbed into air; by cold that it freezes into ice and
becomes similar to solid earth. In reality, however, it is
not the elements which change, but corporeal materia
which, under the influence of the sensible qualities,
migrates through the 'elemental' states. In this connection
it is really only heat and cold which act as motive forces,
and, as the second quality is but a negation of the first, it
is, in the last analysis, heat alone which is the origin of
the 'rotation'. It is the effect of fire alone that renders the
substance in the alchemists' retort successively liquid,
gaseous, fiery, and once again solid. Thus, it imitates in
miniature the 'work' of Nature herself.
The scheme outlined above also has a meaning in regard
to the soul; and here the qualities expansion, contraction,
dissolution, and solidification take the place of hot, cold,
wet, and dry . We shall return to this later.. Mention has
already been made of the correspondence between the
four elements and states of the soul.
The 'speculative' value of this alchemy - in the ancient
sense of speculatio, that is to say, a 'mirroring' of spiritual
truths - rests on the fact that the observation of a single
visible case can be a key to the grand rhythms of nature.
The penetration into the invisible substratum of an
individual substance, which modern chemistry has as its
goal, does not contribute to this value, but on the contrary
provides quite different data which do not facilitate a
total vision of the corporeal world and that of the soul.
The content of the Hermetic vision of nature may be seen
in the following words· of Muhyi 'cl-Din ibn 'Arabi: 'The
world of nature consists of many forms which are reflected
 in a single mirror - nay, rather, it is a single form,
reflected in many mirrors. ' 1 The paradox expressed here
is the key to the spiritual meaning of appearances.
It is not by chance that the scheme of elements and
natural qualities ('modes of action') given above resembles
the cosmic wheel, whose rim is the sun's orbit and whose
spokes are the four cardinal directions.
Alchemically speaking, the hub of the wheel is the quinta
essentia. By this is meant either the spiritual pole of all
four elements or their common substantial ground, ether,
in which they are all indivisibly contained. In order once
again to attain to this centre, the disequilibrium of the
differentiated elements must be repaired, water must
become fiery, fire liquid, earth weightless, and air solid.
Here, however, one leaves the plane of physical appear­
ances and enters the realm of spiritual alchemy.
Synesios writes: 'It is thus clear what the philosophers
mean when they describe the production of our stone as
the alteration of natures and the rotation of elements.
You now see that by "incorporation" the wet becomes
dry, the volatile stable, the spiritual embodied, the fluid
solid, water fiery, and the air like earth. Thus all four
elements renounce their own nature and, by rotation,
transform themselves into one another.... Just as in the
beginning there was One, so also in this work everything
comes from One and returns to One. This is what is
meant by the retransfonnation of the elements • . . ' 2

                        CHAPTER     7

               OF MATERIA PRIMA


According to the alchemists, the base metals cannot be
transmuted into silver or gold without first being reduced
to their materia prima. If the base metals are regarded as
being analogous to oneMsided and imperfectly 'coagulated'
states of the soul, then the materia prima, to which they must
be reduced, is none other than their underlying 'funda­
mental substance', that is to say, the soul in its original
state, as yet unconditioned by impressions and passions,
and 'uncongealed' into any definite form. Only when
the soul is freed from all its rigidities and inner contra­
dictions does it become that plastic substance on which
the Spirit or Intellect, coming from on high, can imprint
a new 'form' - a form which does not limit or bind, but
on the contrary delivers, because it comes from the
Divine Essence. If the form of a base 'metal' was a kind
of 'coagulation', and thus a fetter, the form of a noble
'metal' is a true symbol, and as such an immediate link
with its own prototype in God.
According to the alchemists, the soul, in its original state
of pure receptivity, is fundamentally one with the materia
prima of the whole world. In one way this is but a restate­
ment of the theoretical premise of all alchemy, namely
that macrocosm and microcosm correspond to one
anothera At the same time it is also an expression of the
goal of the alchemical work. The unity of the soul with
materia prima is truly 'lived' and known only to the extent
to which the work has progressed along the road to its com­
pletion. -And here we touch on the real secret of alchemy,
why everything that is said about it must of necessity
remain no more than an indkation and a symbol.

                                                           97
 Materia prima, the fundamental substance of the soul
 (psyche), is in the first place the substance of the individual
 or ego --bound consciousness; then of all psychic forms,
 regardless of the individual beings; and finally of the whole
 world. All these interpretations are valid; for, if the 'web'
 of the world were not fundamentally of the same nature as
 that of the soul, every individual would be imprisoned in
 his own dream - which is absurd. Even if, in relation to
 the immutable Spirit, the world is a 'dream', the 'dream'
is nevertheless consistent within itself. 'We are such stuff
 as dreams are made on', said Shakespeare in his Hermetic
play The Tempest. The opposition of 'inward' and 'out­
 ward', of the world of the soul and the physical world, is
woven into this dream.
Symbolically materia prima lies 'below', because it is com­
pletely passive, and it appears as 'dark', because, as the
absolutely unformed, it eludes every advance of the
intelligence. This is the source of the misunderstanding
which confuses the materia prima of the alchemists with the
'collective unconscious' of modern psychology. Materia,
however - unlike that ill-defined psychic domain - is not
a source of irrational and more or less 'exclusively
psychic' impulses, but, as has been said, the passive basis
of all perceptions. Moreover, the word 'collective', with
regard to what the psychologists have in mind, is contra­
dictory. Either it means, from the etymological point of
view, a collection of things - in this instance inherited
psychic dispositions - in which case it is difficult to under­
stand how there can here be any unity, since inheritance
does not simply accumulate, but also ramifies; or else it
is used inaccurately to mean 'general', in the sense of what
is common to all men - but this is then the nature of the
soul and body. In this case, however, it remains to be
shown how the psychologist, who observes and assesses
oA
 the so-called 'collective unconscious' from above - in that
 he appears to make it the object of 'objective' study -
 does not himself think and act as a result of this 'collective'
 substratum. However one looks at it, his position remains
 that of the man who, sitting in a }?oat, wants to empty
 the sea.
 One must make a distinction between, on the one hand,
 a more or less darksome layer of consciousness lying
beneath everyday consciousness (which layer in any case
cannot be completely unconscious in that it somehow does
enter consciousness) and, on the other hand, the true,
purely passive, and thus in itself unformed, ground of the
soul. The darksome layer referred to (which resembles a
sort of dusk, with a downward tendency towards dense­
ness, rather than a completely dark night) is filled with
the sediments of psychic impressions and behavioural
modes. The true ground of the soul, on the other hand,
is in itself neither dark nor light; nor is it a brooding
volcano of irrational eruptions. On the contrary, when it
is not completely veiled, and so apparently dark, it is the
faithful mirror of its complementary pole, the Universal
Spirit,1 and thus of all truths, which, when the latent
force of imagination approaches the pure condition of
materia prima, occasionally express themselves in the form
of symbols. This can occur in dreams, even if only seldom,
for in general the picture-world of dreams is the play­
thing of the most varied impulses; and as the soul, in the
dream state, is at the mercy of every possible sort of
influence, there can also be an 'impish' or even satanic
distortion of symbols. Not the least of the dangers of
modern 'depth psychology' is that it hopelessly confuses
1   Analogously, vox populi, vox Dei, for the 'people' in the true sense of
the word (a feature of the collectivity which the modern collectivity
has more or less abolished) corresponds exactly to the true ground of
the soul.
                                                                       nn.
true symbols with their distortions. This happens, for
example, when Far...Eastern mandalas are placed on the
same level as the concentric paintings of the mentally
ill. ia A true symbol is never 'irrational'. The 'supra­
rational' must never be confused with the 'irrational'.
                                  *
In order to demonstrate that materia prima contains m
potency all forms of consciousness and thus all forms of
the ephemeral world, the ninth-century Arab alchemist
Abu'l-Qasim al-Iraqi writes: ' ... materia prima is to be
found in a mountain, which contains a measureless
quantity of uncreated things. In this mountain is every
kind of knowledge that can be found in this world. There
is no knowledge, understanding, dream, thought, skill,
interpretation, consideration, wisdom, philosophy, geo­
metry, statecraft, power, courage, distinction, satisfaction,
patience, discipline, beauty, inventiveness, travel, ortho­
doxy, leadership, exactitude, growth, command, authority,
richness, dignity, counsel, or business, which is not con­
tained therein. But also there is no hatred, malevolence,
deceit, infidelity, illusion, tyranny, oppression, corruption,
ignorance, stupidity, lowness, despotism, or excess, and
no song, game, flute or lyre, or marriage, no jest, no arm,
no war, neither blood nor homicide, which is not con­
tained therein ... ' 2 The mountain in which materia prima
is to be found is the human body, for the reductio to
universal substance proceeds methodically from corporeal
ia. As in C. G. Jung's introduction to Richard Wilhelm's German
translation of the Taoist book The Secret of the Golden Blossom [Das
Geheimnis der goldenen Blute] (Munich, 1929). Some of the paintings of
the mentally ill reproduced in this book and compared to mandalas,
are real caricatures, in which childish imaginings of Oriental secret
doctrines can be detected. Others are harmless and insignificant
trifles.

consciousness, which must first be 'dissolved' from within,
before man can attain to the soul beyond the level of
forms - and not merely indirectly through its sensory
experiences. This explains Basilius Valentinus' interpre­
tation of the alchemical key-word V.I.T.R.I.O.L.: Visita
interiora terrae �· rectificando invenies occultum lapidem, ('Visit
the interior of the earth; through purification thou wilt
find the hidden stone'). The interior of the earth is also
the interior of the body, that is, the inward, undiffer­
entiated centre of consciousness. The hidden stone is here
none other than materia prima.
                                *
From the 'inward' point of view, the 'reduction of metals
to their primary substance' has nothing to do with a
somna.mbulistic immersion of consciousness in the ''un­
conscious'' '. The 'reduction' occurs only after arduous
combat against the conflicting tendencies of the soul,
whereby all irrational 'knots' or 'complexes' must from
the first be dissolved. The alchemical work is not a
treatment for mental illness.
On passing from differentiated to undifferentiated con..
sciousness, there intervenes a darkness, corresponding to
chaos. This is the condition of materia no longer in posses­
sion of its original purity, but whose differentiated
possibilities are still confused and disordered. Such is the
condition of 'raw material'. If, however, consciousness
goes on to reach a deeper level, it perceives the mirror of
the ground of the soul, which, though not graspable in
its 'substantial' reality, nevertheless reveals its nature -
and this is to reflect, untrammelled, the light of the
Intellect. The chaos of the soul was like lead. The mirror
of the ground of the soul is like silver. It is also comparable
to a pure spring. It is the mythical fountain of youth,
                                                              ,n,
 from whose depths springs forth the mercury-like water
 of life. This is the meaning of the following account by
 the alchemist Bernardus Trevisanus:
 'It happened that one night I had to study with a view
 to a disputation the following day. However, I found a
 little fountain, beautiful and clear, and completely sur­
 rounded by a beautiful stone. The stone lay on the trunk
 of an old hollow oaktree, completely surrounded by a wall,
 so as to prevent cows and other irr�tional animals - and
even birds - from bathing in the fountain. As I was very
sleepy, I sat down on the edge of the fountain, and I saw
that it was also covered in above, and thus completely
enclosed.
'There came along, however, an aged priest, and I asked
him why this fountain was completely closed in, above,
below, and on all sides. He was kindly towards me, and
began to answer me thus: "Sir, the truth is that this spring
possesses a terrible power, greater than any other on
earth. This power is only for the king of the land, whom it
knows well, and who knows it. For two hundred and
eighty-two years the king has bathed himself with this
power in this spring. In doing this the king rejuvenates
himself so much, that no man can conquer him . . ."
' ... On hearing this I returned secretly to the fountain,
and began to open all the locks (which all worked per­
fectly). Then I began to look at the book which I had won
 (at a disputation) and to enjoy its great splendour. But
as I was very sleepy, it fell into the fountain, causing me to
grieve exceeding!y, as I had wished to keep it, since it was
a prize of honour. So I began to look (into the fountain)
until my sight gave out. I then began to empty out the
fountain, and I did this so well and so carefully that soon
only a tenth part remained - apart from the other ten,
which, in spite of my energetic activity, remained as one
Til"\()
mass. As I thus laboured, people suddenly came ... and,
for my transgression I was imprisoned for forty days.
When, after these forty days, I left prison, I went again to
look at the fountain. There I saw black and dark clouds,
which remained for a long time. Finally, however, I saw
everything that my heart desired, and I had no trouble
about it. And you also will have none, if you do not get
lost on a bad and misleading path, neglecting those things
which Nature requires ... ' 3
                                    *

The alchemists give materia prima - which they regard
as both the primary substance of the world and the basic
substance of the soul - a large number of names. The
object of this multiplicity is not so much to protect
Hermetism from the unqualified, as to underline the
fact that this materia is contained in all things, and that
likewise it contains all things. They call it 'sea', because
it carries within it all forms, as the sea the waves, or
'earth' because it nourishes all that 'on it' lives. It is the
'seed of things', the 'basic moistness' (humiditas radicalis),
the hyle. It is 'virgin' on account of its infinite purity and
receptivity and 'meretricious', because it seems to cling
to every form. It is also compared, as we have seen, to
the 'hidden stone', although in its primordial condition
it is to be distinguished from the 'philosophers' stone',
which is the fruit of the whole work. Materia prima can be
considered as 'stone' only in that it remains immutable.
Its designation 'stone' recalls the Persian gohar and the
Arabic Jawhar, which means literally 'precious stone',
and in a metaphorical sense is u�ed to mean 'substance'
(Greek ousia).

  Materia prima is also the 'ore deposit' of all 'metals'. From
  another point of view, however, it is man who is called
  the 'ore deposit', from which the materia of the work has to
 be extracted, as Morienus explained to King Khalid:
 Haec enim res a te extrahitur ,· cuius etiam minera tu existis ('This
 thing is extracted from you, for you are its mine').
 In its chaotic condition, which is neither pure and form­
 able, nor endowed with clear-cut forms, materia is called
 a 'common thing', for, as 'raw material', it is to be found
 everywhere. Yet, at the same time, it is a 'very precious
 thing', because from it the elixir is obtained with which
 one can make gold. Raw material, which in comparison
 with materia prima represents a materia secunda, is compared
 with lead (in which the nature of gold is hidden), or with
 ice (that must be melted), or with a field (that only brings
 forth fruit when it has been ploughed and sown). He�rich
 Kunrath says: ' ... the sodden, moist, fat, and muddy
 earth of Adam, materia prima, from which this large world,
 we ourselves, and our powerful stone were created, makes
its appearance ... '4
 As a tree, materia prima is one with the tree of the world,
whose fruits are sun, moon, and planets. On the 'tree'
of materia grow gold and silver, or all metals, or again
the various phases of the alchemical work with their
symbolical colours, black, white, and red, and sometimes
also yellow, between white and red_ Abu 'l-Qasim al-Iraqi
writes of such a tree, that has its roots, not in earth, but
in the world-sea. Here 'sea' is the materia of the soul,
anima mundi. The tree grows in the 'lands of the \Vest',
thus of the setting sun, for materia corresponds to the West,
just as forma, the essential prototype, corresponds to the
East. The 'tree' can take on the form of a living creature,
for it is the inward form of man. From it is obtained the
'Henrich Kunrath, Tkeatrum sapientiae aetemae.
materia prima    of the work, for in the fruit the origin of the
 tree itself lies hidden.
 'Materia prima, which can produce the form of the elixir,
is obtained from one single tree, which grows in the 'lands
of the West'. It has two branches, which are too high for
anyone who would eat its fruit to reach without labour
and effort, and two others whose fruit is drier and more
wrinkled than that of the former. The flower of the first
of the two branches is red, and the flower of the second is
between white and black. The tree has two further
branches, which are weaker and softer than the first four.
The flower of the first ofthese two branches is black, and
that ofthe second is white and yellow. This tree grows on
the surface of the ocean, just as other plants grow on the
surface of the earth. Whoever eats of this tree, is obeyed
by both men and genii (jinn). It is the same tree as that
which Adam - may peace be upon him! - was forbidden
to eat. When he did eat ofit, he was transmuted from an
angelic form into a human form. This tree can transmute
itself into the form of any living creature ... ' 5
The materia prima of the alchemists is thus both the origin
and the fruit of the work. For the chaos of materia is dark
and opaque only so long as the forms contained in it -
and already 'budded' - do not attain their full develop­
ment. Every 'potency' (potentia) is in essence impenetrable.
This is so in the case of a mine!al which appears dull and
opaque in its amorphous condition, but which, the
moment it takes form as a crystal, is clear and transparent.
However, it must not be concluded from this that all
possibilities fundamentally present in the soul will neces­
sarily be manifested, for in the first place their multi­
plicity is inexhaustible, and secondly the very variety of
the soul's contents is an obstacle to the realization of its
6 Text provided by Dr S. Hussein Nasr, Teheran.
essential 'form', that is, the unitary and harmonious state
of consciousness which is the perfect mirror of the 'Divine
Act'. Thus the true nature of materia prima reveals itself
to the extent to which it receives or takes on true form.
Just as universal substance (materia prima) can only be
grasped by means of knowledge of Pure Being, whose
shadow it is, so also the true ground of the soul can only
be known in its response to the pure Spirit. The soul only
uncovers itself when united as bride to the Spirit-Intellect.
This is what is referred to when one speaks of the marriage
of sun and moon, of king and queen, of sulphur and
quicksilver.
                             *
The 'uncovering' of the receptive ground of the soul and
the 'revelation' of the creative Spirit take place at the
same time. They cannot be separated from one another.
Nevertheless the various phases and aspects of the inward
work can be referred to one or other pole. Every way of
spiritual realization envisages the preparation of a recep­
tive 'stuff' or substance, and the 'working' or influence
of the spiritual or divine Act upon it. Depending on the
way followed, however, the emphasis - doctrinal as well
as practical - will lie either on one or other of the two
inward processes, and, in view of this, the spiritual goal
will either be set on the 'immobile Act' or on the immutable
and pure ground of the soul. The ar.tisanal symbolism of
alchemy, which consists in the 'ennobling' of a mineral
substance, requires that the soul be conceived as a 'sub­
stance', and also that the idea of a 'first substance'
(materia prima) sta:r:id at the centre of all considerations.
Even the effect of the transcendent Intellect, which is
'antipodal' to the 'stuff' of the soul, is, in the symbolic
language of alchemy, expressed 'substantially', as a
chemical transmutation. The fact that this transmutation
exceeds purely artisanal .possibilities indicates its more­
than-substantial origin.
The two aspects or phases of spiritual realization are
clearly illustrated in a certain traditional form of the
crucifix decorated with symbols. As an example of this,
we select a silver reliquary cross of the beginning of the
thirteenth century, which is conserved in the Monastery
of Engelberg, and whose decoration proves that alchemy
has been liriked with the art of the goldsmith. The crucifix
is decorated with pictures on both front and back. The
front (recognizable by its deeper relief) carries in the
centre the figure of the crucified Saviour, and, on the
extremities of its four· arms, representations of the four
evangelists, along with their animal symbols. This was a
very widespread composition in the Christian art of the
Middle Ages, but here it appears in a relatively 'natural­
istic' form. In the older liturgical crosses the figure of
Christ or the Lamb is surrounded by the four celestial
animals alone, which confers on the symbolism a greater
rigour and at the same time· a greater breadth. In a
similar manner, the back of the crucifix shows, in the
centre, the Holy Virgin, enthroned, with the Christ­
Child, and on the four arms the signs of the four elements.
Fire is above, air on the right (of the beholder), water on
the left, and earth below.
The two sides of the cross can be regarded as representa­
tions of the 'essential' and the 'substantial', of the 'active'
and the 'passive', of the farma and the materia of the
cosmos: the front, bearing the human figures of the Divine
Word and Its four 'revelatory modes' (the evangelists)
 clearly corresponds (in its relation to the symbolism of the
reverse side) to the Divine Act or 'essential form', of the
 cosmos. The reverse side, on the other hand, corresponds
Reliquary cross of Heinrich von 111artenbach. Ca.   I 200.
Same cross. Reverse side.
to materia prima, or rather, to the world which proceeds
therefrom. The Virgin, in the centre, symbolically assumes
the role of ether, which, from a certain Hermetical point
of view, is to be identified with materia prima. The four
elements, for their part, manifest the four fundamental
determinations of materia prima, and thus also the four
foundations of the whole formal world. The inviolate
equilibrium of materia prima, its 'virginal' nature, is made
clear by the central position given to the Virgin, relative
to the four signs of fire, air, water, and earth.
It is unnecessary to add that this cosmological inter­
pretation of these Christian images in no way detracts
from their theological meaning. On the contrary, the
co-incidence of two spiritual 'perspectives' in one and the
same symbol confers on it an even greater import - from
both points of view. It reveals all the more clearly its
truly metaphysical content, and provides a foretaste of
the completely unlimited possibilities of pure contempla­
tion, which are open to an artisan or artist experienced
in the Hermetic art and at the same time rooted in the
Christian faith.
The intrinsic connection between the two symbolic com­
positions - to be found respectively on the front and back
of the cross - finds expression in the Dove of the Holy
Spirit, shown descending towards the Virgin, and in the
Christ-Child present on her lap. The dove represents the
presence of the uncreated Spirit, under whose influence
materia prima undergoes formal development, just as, under
His shadow, the Virgin conceives and brings forth. As a
Child, born of her, the Divine Spirit takes on form. He
remains the same in essence, but clothes himself in sub­
stance given to Him by His mother. He adapts Himself
to the differentiated aspects of matter. 6
6   Thus, according to the doctrine of the Islamic mystics, the revelation
 The form of the cross itself, which expresses the law of the
 whole cosmos, is to be found in each of the poles. At one
 and the same time it corresponds to the fourfold revelation
 of the Eternal Word, and to the two pairs of opposites
 contained in materia prima. Thus, every spiritual work
proceeds both from the essential Act and from Its 'sub­
stantial' recipient. The soul cannot be transmuted without
the co-operation of the Spirit, and the Spirit illumines
the soul only to the extent of its passive preparedness and
in accordance with its manner. The opposition between
the two poles is overcome only on the highest level, in
pure Being. Here the receptive 'substance' itself is none
other than a first, immediate, and inward determination
of the Divine Spirit, who thus descends only into that
which is already his, taking on its form and manner. 7
The interpretations given for the images described above
can be supplemented by various other details. Thus each
of the four arms of the cross has at the end three semi­
circles. In this way the fourfold groups of evangelists and
elements are increased to the twelvefold groups of apostles
and zodiacal signs. On the front of the cross, angels hold
a circle above the head of Christ, whilst on the back,
pictures of St Peter and of various holy bishops surround
the figure of the Virgin. In these two dispositions may be
recognized the celestial and ecclesiastical hierarchies,
which, according to St Dionysius the Areopagite, face
one another respectively giving and receiving.
Further details refer even more explicitly to alchemy.

the latter confers on it. See my translation of the Fuful al-Ifikam by

On the trunk of the cross one can see Moses erecting the
pole with the bronze snake. This is both an Old Testa­
ment prototype of the Crucifix.ion and a symbol of the
alchemical fixation of quicksilver. The same process is
also expressed in the group of animals in combat im­
mediately beneath the feet of the crucified Christ. Cer­
tainly the first and most immediate meaning ofthis group
112
 is the victory of the lion ofJuda over the infernal dragon,
 but the same picture can also be interpreted as the
 subduing of 'volatile' quicksilver by the solar lion of
 sulphur.
 There is a Far-Eastern parallel to this Christian icono­
 graphy, which, even though far removed in space and
 time, serves all the more strongly to reinforce the universal
 validity of the symbolism in question. We have in mind a
 certain form of mandala which is used in Japanese Shingon,
 one of the branches of Mahayana Buddhism. The mandala
 consists of a banner painted on both sides. On one side is
 a representation of the 'world of the indestructibles' or of
 the 'diamantine elements', and on the other is a repre­
sentation of the 'womb-element'. In the centre of both
sides is one of the forms of manifestation of the 'Great
Enlightener', the Buddha Mahavairochana, sitting on a
lotus. In the first representation - that of the immutable
prototypes - the Buddha has a contemplative mien. His
head is surrounded by a white halo. In the second repre­
sentation he is portrayed emerging from an open lotus,
and with a red halo, the symbol of activity. This means
that here the 'substantial' pole is regarded in its dynamic
aspect, corresponding to the Tao-Buddhistic doctrine
regarding the ac_tive essence of non-action and the passive
essence of action. Meditation on the first-mentioned
representation leads to the knowledge of the way of
deliverance from becoming, while meditation on the
second has as its fruit the knowledge of the five cosmologi­
cal sciences. 8

versa! Spirit is also to be found in the Far-Eastern sym­
bolism of the mirror. Chinese ritual or magic mirrors
usually have, on their reverse side, a representation of a
celestial dragon. This corresponds to the Universal Spirit
or Logos. In Shinto, the pre-Buddhist religion of Japan,
the sacred mirror (which reflects the image of the Sun­
Goddess Amaterasu) is obviously also a symbol of the
soul in the state of spiritual purity, in which it may
receive and reflect Truth - supra-conceptual, original
Truth. This brings us back to the Hermetic assimilation
of materia prima with the ground of the soul.
Rather surprisingly, the same symbolism may also be
found amongst certain of the North American Indians,
namely, the Crows and the Shoshonis. Here the mirror is
indeed a magic mirror, by means of which a shaman can
find things which have been lost or forgotten. (He sees
them in the depths of the mirror.) On the surface of the
mirror a red zigzag line is painted, representing lightning,
which, for the Indians, is the symbol of the Great Spirit,
and of Revelation, just as is also (for the Indians) the
eagle planing in the heavens, and swooping down like
lightning.

                       CHAPTER     8

              UNIVERSAL NATURE

An important adage of the alchemists ran as follows:
 'Art is the imitation of nature in her mode of operation.'
 The model for the alchemical work is nature. Nature
comes to the aid of the 'artist' who has mastered her mode
of operation, and perfects, in her 'play', what he has
begun with labour and e:ffort. The expression 'nature' has
here a very precise meaning. It does not simply mean
the involuntary 'becoming' of things, but rather a unitary
power or cause whose essence may be known by perceiv­
ing its all-embracing rhythm - a rhythm which rules both
the outward and the inward world.
As .Western alchemy in general uses the language of
Platonic metaphysics, one must refer to the latter in order
to appreciate fully all that the expression natura or physis
includes. The most meaningful description of nature is to
be found in the Enneads (III, 8) of Plotinus, where he
writes: 'If one should ask nature why she produces her
works, she would answer as follows - if indeed she con­
descended to answer at all: It would be more fitting not
to ask (i.e., not to probe with the mind), but to learn
silently, even as I am silent. For it is not my way to speak
(in contradistinction from the Spirit who reveals Himself
in words). But this shalt thou lea'rn, that everything that
becomes is the object of my silent vision, a vision that is
my original possession, for I myself arise from a vision
(namely, the vision of the "universal soul", which con­
templates the Universal Spirit, even as the latter con­
templates the Infinite). I love contemplation, and that
which in me contemplates immediately engenders the
object of its contemplation. Thus the mathematicians
                                                       II_li
  write down figures as a result of their contemplation. I
  however write down nothing. I only watch, and the forms
  of the material world arise, as if they proceeded from out
 ofme ... '
 Thus nature, in her receptive essence, is related to materia
prima; and indeed, alongside materia prima (hyle), she is
 situated below the three cognitive hypostases of the
 Platonic universe. Above her is the 'universal soul'
 (psyche), and above the latter is the Universal Spirit (nous),
 who alone contemplates the ineffable One, and con­
 templating It, seeks to manifest it endlessly. Below nature
 is materia prima alone, the passive foundation of all mani­
festation, which itself does not participate in becoming,
 and thus remains eternally 'virgin'. One could call nature
 the maternal aspect of materia prima, since it is she that
 'gives birth'. She is operative and mobile, whereas
materia prima in itself remains motionless.
Muhyi 'd-Drn ibn 'Arabi, the 'greatest master' (ash­
sheikh al-akbar) of Islamic mysticism, and the greatest
enunciator of Hermetic principles, conceives of universal
nature (tabtat al-kull) as the feminine or maternal side of
the creative act. She is the 'merciful "breathing-out" of
God' (nafas ar-rahmdn), which confers differentiated exis­
tence on the undifferentiated possibilities latent in 'non­
being' Cadam). This 'breathing-out' is merciful, for the
possibilities which are to be manifested, are already
longing for manifestation; but the same power also has a
darksome and confusing aspect. Multiplicity as such is
deception and separation from God. 1
Ibn tArabi's explanation of universal nature as a kindly
and maternal, but at the same time, confusing, power of
divine origin, is here of especial importance, for it consti­
tutes a bridge towards the Hindu idea of shakti, the
1 See my translation of the FuiU/ al-Ifikam, op. cit.


II6
feminine-productive power of God. On this idea of shakti
are based all those tantric spiritual methods which are
more closely related to alchemy than to any other of the
spiritual arts. The Hindus, indeed, regard alchemy itself
as a tantric method.
As Kali:, the slzakti is on the one hand the universal
mother, who lovingly embraces all creatures, and on the
other hand the tyrannical power which delivers them
over to destruction, death, time, and space (which causes
separation). She is sometimes depicted as having sublime
beauty, sometimes as having features which cause terror.
Her colour is dark, like her 'ungraspable' essence. The
shakti is also mdyd, the divine art, which confers on beings
their multiple forms and thereby also alienates them from
their one and infinite origin.
This way of regarding the divine creative power may
appear to spring from a standpoint somewhat different
from that of scholastic theology, and yet it does not
contradict the latter, for the view that existence is both a
divine gift and also (from the point of view of pure being)
a limitation, is also to be found in the classical ontology
taught by the Church Fathers.
The particularity of the conception described here, which
combines the metaphysic ofan Ibn rArabi with the Hindu
doctrine of shakti, is that it refers both aspects of existence
(or 'becoming'), the positive as well as the negative, to
one and the same root-cause, namely, to universal nature,
which is depicted as being both maternal and terrible.
In contradistinction from the personal action of God,
which is the real object of theology as such, His action or
operation in the world is here represented in impersonal
mode. This corresponds entirely with the special view­
point of alchemy - which is not for this reason agnostic,
although the concept of 'nature', as used and misunder-
                                                           II'7
  stood by the philosophers of the 'Enlightenment',
 indirectly derives from the Hermetic natura. That this
 natura should have become, with the secularization and
 desacralization ofth� sciences, a vague and non-committal
 substitute for God, was not entirely unconnected with a
 concomitant narrowing of the theological horizon, which
 rendered more difficult a simultaneous vision of both the
 'personal' and 'impersonal' aspects of God's revelation
of-Him.self.
 With regard to the outward work of alchemy, nature is
the driving power behind all transmutations - the
 'potential energy' of things. In inward alchemy she
appears as that maternal po�er which releases the soul
from its fallow, arid, and sterile existence. Thus she is the
power of desire and longing in man, and at the same time
much more, for, as inexhaustible potency, 'nature'
develops all the capacities hidden in the soul, against or
in keeping with the desires or the ego, depending on
whether the latter assimilates the power of nature, or
becomes its victim. She is always feminine - both as Dame
Nature and also in her terrible aspect as the Great Dragon
which roams through all things.
According to one interpretation (associated with the
name of 'nature' even to this day), nature always has
something of a compulsion about her. This marks an
essential difference between her and the freely operating
human will. She possesses this aspect also in alchemy, at
least in one connection, because, from a certain stage of
the work onwards, this compulsion is transmuted into a
cosmic rhythm, which does not bind, but liberates. Dante
called this 'the love which moves the sun and the other
stars'. Psychologically speaking, that which at the be...
ginning of the work appears as a dangerous and disturbing
impulse, becomes, with the achievement of mastership, a
t18

 force carrying the consciousness into higher spheres. This
 is a law present in all true ascesis, distinguishing it from
 puritanism, for in true spirituality it is not a question of
 destroying the natural forces but rather of taming them,
so that they become vehicles of the Spirit. That alone
which must be destroyed is the egoistic tendency, which
deforms the genuine essence of these powers. The latter,
in fact, is neither good nor evil in itself, but naturally
innocent. One speaks commonly of 'sublimation', thus
borrowing an alchemical expression for a psychological
process - which, however, is completely powerless to
overcome certain tensions on a purely profane basis, and
without the help of a sacred art or of grace. One can only
speak of a cosmic extension of the powers of the soul in
connection with a genuine spiritual art; for something
cosmic (and, indirectly, divine) must first enter man -
by means of the revealed symbol and its faithful applica­
tion - before he may loose himself from mere arbitrariness
and attain true freedom. It is in this light that one must
regard certain exercises which imitate the rhythms of
nature, such as, for example, the regulation of the breath
- a procedure which was probably known to alchemy.
The latter is not an automatic technique, but something
which can serve the goal of spiritual realization only on
the basis of certain outward and inward conditions. In
the same category are a number of special means - dubious
at first glance and at all events dangerous - for awakening
the inward power, such as the contemplation of Dame
Nature in the beauty of the feminine body - a method
which is practised both in tantra and in Hermetic
chivalry. 2

 One may well wish to ask whether: the familiar distinction
 between 'natural' development and the 'supernatural'
operation of grace has any meaning at all for the Hermetic
way of looking at things. To this the answer is in the
negative, in the sense that the working of grace does not
fall outside universal nature, and, in addition, always has
repercussions within the natural order in the narrower
sense. Nevertheless the distinction is justified when one
considers any given level of nature, whose relative sub­
jection to 'compulsion' can always be overcome by grace,
which irrupts suddenly and without constraint, like
lightning. Thus the expression 'nature' embraces, from
case to case, a greater or lesser domain of reality.
An anonymous alchemical text entitled Purissima Revelatio3
calls nature a 'book' in which only he who has received
illumination from God may read. It is also called 'a very
thick wood into which many have penetrated in order to
try and wrest its holy secrets from it. But they have been
swallowed up, because they did not have the light
weapons which alone could conquer the terrible dragon
protecting the golden fleece. And those who were not
killed, had to retrace their steps, gripped by terror and
covered in shame and disgrace. Nature is also that
measureless sea on which the Argonauts set out. '\/Voe to
sailors who do not know our art! For they may travel
their whole life long without ever reaching harbour. They
will find no refuge from the frightful storms. Burnt by
the sun and frozen by icy winds they will undoubtedly
perish, unless they implore the help of the most high and
mighty Lord ... For it is not given to many to reach the
shore of Colchis ... Only the wise Argonauts, who strictly
observe the laws of nature and are completely devoted to

the will of the Almighty, can win the precious golden
fleece, which Medea, the personification of nature, will
yield up, against the order of her darksome father and to
the great anger of the surprised dragon ... ' Medea is an
image of the 'dark' side of nature. Universal nature, like
Md.yd, has two directions or movements - one which tends
away from the spiritual centre towards multiplicity (and
which in man is linked with passion), and one which,
from multiplicity, leads back towards the spiritual centre.
The former is here likened to Medea, and the latter to
Sophia or wisdom. Both are feminine in relation to the
human will, being either mistress or bride: '. . . And woe
to hirn who, like Jason, having conquered with the help
of Medea, lets himself be seduced by his dangerous con­
quest and submits to nature the sorceress, instead of
remaining constant and true to his divine bride, wisdom.
On the other hand, happy is he who, affianced to wisdom,
knows how to seduce that sorceress nature, in order to
attain to her secrets, which she no longer can withhold
from him, and who returns home, possessor of the golden
fleece, and true to his virtuous betrothed . . . ' Like the
tantric methods, the alchemical work awakens a terrible
natural power, which destroys the unprepared and the
unqualified, but which raises the wise to spiritual
supremacy. This power lives in man, but its name indi-­
cates that it is not something individual and ego-bound,
but a part or aspect of an impersonal and endless rhythm.
This is the only unfalsified interpretation which has been
conserved in the expression 'nature'.
                         CHAPTER     9

    'NATURE CAN OVERCOME NATURE'

  In the world of forms Nature's 'mode of operation' con­
  sists of a continuous rhythm of 'dissolutions' and 'coagu...
  lations', or of disintegrations and formations, so that the
  dissolution of any formal entity is but the preparation for
  a new conjunction between aforma and its materia. Nature
 acts like Penelope who, to rid herself of unworthy suitors,
 unwound at night the wedding garment which she had
 woven during the day.
 In this way too the alchemist works. Following the adage
solve et coagula, he dissolves the ,imperfect coagulations of
 the soul, reduces the latter to its materia, and crystallizes
 it anew in a nobler form. But he can accomplish this work
only in unison with Nature, by means of a natural
vibration of the soul which awakes during the course of
the work and links the human and cosmic domains. Then
of her own accord Nature comes to the aid of art, accord­
ing to the alchemical adage: 'The progress of the work
pleases nature greatly' (operis processio multum naturae
placet).
The two phases of Nature - dissolution and coagulation -
which seem opposed from a superficial point of view but
which in reality are mutually complementary, can in a
certain sense be related to the two poles, essence and
substance, though these of course are not present within
Nature as a pure opposition of Activity and Passivity,
but merely as relative reflections of the latter. Within
Nature it is alchemical Sulphur which corresponds to the
active pole, and alchemical Quicksilver which corresponds
to the passive pole. Sulphur is relatively active; it is
Sulphur which confers form. Quicksilver resembles passive
                                                         12�
 materia and is thus more immediately linked with Nature
herself and her feminine character. Since Sulphur repre­
sents the essential pole in its natural refraction, it can be
said to be active in passive mode, while Quicksilver, in
view of the dynamic character of Nature, can be said to
be passive in active mode. The relation of the two pri­
mordial forces to each other is thus similar to that of man
and woman in sexual union.
The best symbol for the couple Sulphur-Mercury is the
Chinese device of 'Tin-rang, with the black pole in the
white vortex and the white pole in the black vortex, as an
indication that the passive is present in the active, and the
active in the passive, just as man contains the nature of
woman, and woman the nature ofman1:




In the soul Sulphur represents the essence or spirit, where­
as Quicksilver corresponds to the soul itself in its receptive
and passive role.
According to Muhyi ,d-Din ibn 'Arabi, who always has
the highest interpretations in mind, Sulphur corresponds
to the 'Divine Command', that is to say, to the fiat lux by
means of which the world became a cosmos out of chaos,
while Quicksilver represents Universal Nature, the passive
counterpart of the former. 2 Thus, even although within
the specific realm of alchemy the two poles appear as more
or less conditioned forces, it is highly useful to remember

1 This has not merely a psychological, but also and above all an
ontological, basis.
z Futuliat al-Mekkiyah.
their unconditioned prototypes, as only by so doing can
one understand, for example, in what respect Sulphur
corresponds to the spiritual will, and Quicksilver to the
'plastic' capacity of the soul. In an immediate sense, and
in its general psychological interpretation, the spiritual
will proceeds from an ideal and endeavours to form the
soul in accordance with this. In its original essence, how­
ever, which reveals itself only within the framework of a
traditional spiritual art, the spiritual will is a vibration
coming from the centre of the being, a spiritual act which
breaks through thought and which on the plane of the
soul effects two things: a broadening and a deepening of
the 'sense of being', and a clarification and a stabilization
of the essential contents of consciousness. In accordance
with this, the 'plastic' capacity of the soul, which responds
to the original Act of the Spirit, is not merely the passive
imagination that takes on and develops forms, but a
capacity which gradually extends beyond the confines of
the individual consciousness bound to the body.

                             *
Sulphur, the original masculine power, and Quicksilver,
the original feminine power, both strive towards the whole­
ness of their one and eternal prototype. The latter is at
the same time the reason for their opposition and of. their
mutual attraction - just as the masculine and feminine
natures long for the integrality of the human state, and as
a result of this seek both to separate from one another, and
to unite with one another. By means of their physical
union both try to re�establish the image of their common
eternal prototype. This is the marriage of man and
woman, sulphur and quicksilver, Spirit and soul.
In the mineral domain it is gold that is born of the perfect
union of the two generative principles. Gold is the true
  product of metallic generation. Every other metal is
  either a premature birth or an abortion, an imperfect
  gold, and, in this way of looking at things, the alchemical
  work is nothing other than a midwife or helper, which
 art offers nature, so that the latter can perfectly ripen the
 fruit whose maturation was being hindered by certain
 temporal circumstances. 3 This can be understood both in
 the mineral and in the microcosmic sense. Muhyi 'cl-Din
 ibn 1:Arabi regards gold as the symbol of the original and
 uncorrupted state (al-fitrah) of the soul, the form in which
 the human soul was created at the beginning. According
 to the Islamic conception the soul of every child uncon-­
sciously approaches this Adamic state, before being led
away from it again by the errors imposed on it by adults. 4
The uncorrupted state possesses an inward equilibrium
of forces. This is expressed by the stability of gold.
According to a widely held cosmological view - already
mentioned by Aristotle - Nature is characterized by four
properties, which are manifested ·on the sensory level by
heat, cold, humidity, and dryness. Heat and dryness are
associated with Quicksilver. The first two properties thus
have a masculine and predominantly active character,
whereas the last two have a feminine and more passive
character. vVhat this means can be seen more clearly when
one relates heat to expansion, cold to contraction,
humidity to dissolution, and dryness to coagulation.
The heat, or power of expansion, proper to Sulphur,
causes the growth of a given form from its essential centre,

3 The most recent discoveries in the realm of nuclear fission seem to
confirm that the qualitatively lowest metals are the most unstable.
Uranium closely resembles lead.
4 This doctrine is not to be confused with the opinion ofJ.-J. Rousseau

that man is good in himself. The unconscious recapitulation of the
primordial state in the child does not exclude negative tendencies or
hereditary defects.
Tllh
and this force of Nature is closely connected with life.
The dryness of Sulphur coagulates or 'fixes' aforma on the
level of its materia, so that it imitates the immutability of
its prototype in a passive and material way. Put another
way, Sulphur's power of expansion is the dynamic - and
therefore relatively passive - aspect of the essential Act,
and coagulation is the inverse or lower aspect of the
immutability of Essence. Pure Act is motionless and True
Essence is active. The coldness, or power of contraction,
of Quicksilver opposes the coagulating power of Sulphur,
in that it surrounds forms from the outside, as it were, and
holds them fast, like a cosmic womb. 5 The moist and
dissolving character of Quicksilver, however, resembles
feminine receptivity, which, like water, can take on all
forms, without thereby being altered.
The four natural properties or 'modes of operation',
which are related in pairs to Sulphur and Quicksilver,
can, in their successive coagulations and dissolutions,
enter into a variety of combinations with one another.
Generation only takes place when the properties of
Sulphur and Quicksilver mutually penetrate each other.
When sulphurous dryness joins one-sidedly with mercurial
coldness, so that coagulation and contraction come to­
gether (without the action thereon of the expansive heat
of Sulphur or the dissolving humidity of Quicksilver), a
complete rigor of soul and body ensues. In terms of life,
this is the torpor of old age, and on the ethical level,
avarice. More generally and more profoundly, it is the
wrapping up of the ego-consciousness in itself, a mortal
condition of the soul which has lost its original receptivity
and vitality, both spiritually and sensually. The other way

 round, a one-sided conjunction of heat and humidity (i.e.,
 expansion and dissolution) results in a volatilization of
 powers. It resembles the condition of consuming· passion,
 vice, and dissipation of spirit. Characteristically, the two
 types of disequilibrium are usually to be found together.
 One begets the other. The numbing of the powers of the
 soul leads to dissipation, and the fire of a passion lived out
 regardlessly brings inward death. The soul which is
 avaricious with itself and closes itself to the Spirit, is
 carried away in the vortex of dissolving impressions.
 Creative equilibrium is only produced when the expan­
sive power of Sulphur and the contractive power of
Quicksilver hold the balance, and when, at the same time,
the masculine coagulating power enters into a fruitful
union with the feminine dissolving capacity. This is the
true marriage of the two poles of being, which are repre..
sented inter alia by the intersecting triangles of the Seal
of Solomon      (&, -   the sign which also symbolizes the
synthesis of the four elements. The applications of this law
are quite unlimited; only a few psychological and 'vital'

  added that traditional medicine is founded on the same
 principles, the four elements then corresponding to the
 four humours. 6
 The soul, in her entire breadth, as unfolded in the course
 of the alchemical work, is governed by the two funda­
 mental forces Sulphur and Quicksilver which slumber,
 in the 'chaotic' state of the unawakened soul, like the fire
 in flint and the water in ice. When they awake, they first
 of all manifest their opposition in a certain outward
tension. From this tension they continue to grow, the one
on the other, and, to the extent that they become free,
they embrace one another, in that they are related to one
another as man and woman. To these two phases of their
development are related the first two clauses of the
Hermetic formula: 'Nature takes delight in Nature;
Nature contains Nature, and Nature can overcome
Nature.' The last clause means that the two powers, when
they have so grown that one can embrace the other,
reunite on a higher plane, so that their opposition, which
previously had bound the soul, now becomes a fruitful
complementarism, by means of which the soul achieves

dominion over the entire world of psychic forms and
currents. Thus Nature as a liberating force, overcomes
Nature as tyranny and entanglement.
                                  *
 When the immutable Divine Act which governs the cos-­
 mos, is symbolically represented by a motionless vertical
 axis, the 'course' of Nature, in relation to it, is like a spiral,
which winds itself around this axis, so that with each
encirclement it realizes a new plane or degree of existence.
 This is the primordial symbol of the serpent or dragon,
which winds itself round the axis of the tree of the world. 7
Almost all the symbols of Nature proceed from the .spiral
 or the circle. The rhythm of the successive 'unrollings'
 and 'rollings' of Nature, of the alchemical solve et coagula
is represented by the double spiral: @\§), whose form also
lies at the basis of the zoomorphic representations of the
Shakti. Also related to this is the representation of two
serpents or dragons winding themselves in contrary
directions round a staff or tree. These correspond to the
two complementary phases of nature or the two funda­
mental forces. 8 This is the ancient heritage of images of
nature on which both alchemy, and certain traditions of
the East (especially tantrism) draw.
It should also be noted here that the use of a serpent or
dragon as the image of a cosmic power is to be found in all
parts of the world. It is especially characteristic of those
traditional arts, such as alchemy, which are concerned
with the subtle world. A reptile moves without legs and
by means of an uninterrupted rhythm of its body, so that
it is the incorporation, so to say, of .a subtle oscillation.
Furthermore, its essence is both fiery and cold, conscious

I See Rene Guenon, op. cit.
 and elemental. The resemblance in question is so real that
 most if not all traditional cultures have regarded serpents
 as the occasional carriers of subtle or psychic powers.
 One need only think of the serpent as the guardian of
 tombs in Western and Far-Eastern antiquity.
 In laya-yoga, a spiritual method belonging to the realm of
 tantrism, whose name signifies union (yoga) achieved
through solution (laya), the awakening of the Shakti within
the human microcosm is compared with the awakening
of a serpent (kundalini), which until then had remained
coiled up in the subtle centre known as mulddhdra.
According to a certain correspondence between the subtle
and corporeal orders this centre is located at the lower
end of the vertebral column. Kundalini is awakened by
certain exercises in spiritual concentration, by means of
which it gradually ascends, in spiral fashion, the spiritual
axis of man, bringing into play even wider and higher
states of consciousness, until it finally restores the plenitude
of consciousness in the supraformal Spirit. 9 In this repre­
sentation, which must not be conceived literally, but as a
symbolical - though logical and consequential - descrip­
tion of inward processes, one will again recognize the
image of Nature or Shakti twining round the world-axis.
That the developing power should come 'from below' is
in keeping with the fact that potency (potentia) - like
materia prima - in its passivity represents the 'base' of the
cosmos, and not the summit.
In the Hermetic tradition, Universal Nature in her
latent condition is likewise represented as a coiled up
reptile. This is the dragon Uroboros which, curling into
a circle, bites its own tail.
Nature in her dynamic phase, on the other hand, is
portrayed by means of the two serpents or dragons, which,

in the form of the well-known model of the staff of Hermes
or caduceus, wind themselves round an axis - that of the
world or of man - in opposing directions. This duplication
of the primordial serpent has also its counterpart in laya­
yoga, for Kundalint is likewise divided into two subtle
forces, Ida and Pingala, which in opposite directions wind
themselves round Merudanda, the microcosmic prolonga­
tion of the world..axis. At the beginning of the spiritual
work, the Shakti is present in this divided form, and only
after the two forces are activated alternately by means of
a form of concentration based on breathing, does Kunda­
lint awake from its sleep and start to ascend. As soon as
it has reached the highest threshold of ego-consciousness,
the two opposing forces become completely dissolved in it.
For alchemy the two forcef represented as serpents or
dragons are Sulphur and Quicksilver. Their macrocosmic
prototype is the two phases - increasing and decreasing -
of the sun's annual course, separated from one another
by the winter and summer solstices. 10 The connection
between the tantric and alchemical symbolisms is obvious:
of the two forces Pingald and Ida, which wind themselves
round the Merudanda, the first is described as being hot
and dry, characterized by the colour red, and, lik�
alchemical Sulphur, compared with the sun. The second
force, Idd, is regarded as being cold and humid, and in its
silvery pallor is associated with the moon.
In his book On the Hieroglyphic Figures Nicolas Flamel
writes of the mutual relationship of Sulphur and Quick­
silver: '. . . these are the two serpents which are fixed
around the caduceus, or Staff of Mercury, and by means
of which Mercury wields his great power and transforms
himself as he wills. Whoever kills one, says Haly, 11 also
kills the other, for each one of them can only die along
with her sister [by means of their death both pass over
into a new state] ... After both have been placed in the
"vessel" of the grave [that is to say, the inward, "hermeti­
cally sealed" vessel], they begin to bite one another
savagely, and, on account of their great poison and raging
fury, do not let go of each other - unless the cold should
deter them - until both, as a result of their dripping

so long as Nature remains "untamed", the opposition of
the two forces is manifested in destructive or "poisonous"
mode], so that they finally kill one another and dro�n in

them into living and perpetual water [in that they are
reunited on a higher level], after they have lost, with their
downfall and decomposition, their first, natural forms,

tamed the serpents, which wound themselves round his
staff and conferred on him the theurgic power of 'binding'
and 'loosing'. This· means the transmutation of chaos into
cosmos, of conflict into order, through the power of a
spiritual act, which both discriminates and unites.
In the Jewish tradition, as a counterpart to the Staff of
Hermes and the Hindu symbol of Brahma..danda,13 we find
Moses' rod, which indeed turns itself into a serpent. In
Islamic mysticism Moses' rod, which 'on God's command'
turned into a serpent, and on being 'grasped' by Moses
turned back into a rod, is compared with the passional
soul (nafs), which through the influence of the Divine
Spirit can be turned into a wonder... working power.
Because it incorporates a spiritual power, Moses' rod,
turned into serpent, can vanquish the serpents engendered
by the Egyptian sorcerers and made of magic - and
therefore psychic - power; for the Spirit prevails over the
soul and its domain.14 This interpretation of the story

  of Moses' rod mentioned in the Koran recalls the Hindu
  distinction between viqya-maya (Universal Nature in her
   '�nlightening' aspect) and avidyd-maya (Universal Nature
  as the power of illusion). In this distinction, however, is
  also to be found the deepest sense of the Hermetic pro­
  verb: 'Nature can overcome Nature.' From the alchemical
  point of view the changing of Moses' rod into a serpent
  and its subsequent resolidification corresponds exactly to
  the solve et coagula of the great work.
  In medieval Christian art there is a representation of the
  Staff of Hermes which Flamel's fable brings vividiy to
  mind. The image ofa pair of serpents or dragons entwined
  together and biting one another was already common in
  early Irish-Anglo-saxon art. In Romanesque sculpture it
  occurs so commonly and plays such a striking role in the
  decoration of sacred buildings,15 that one might readil?
  conclude that it was a kind of 'signature' of certain
  Christian-Hermetic schools. Moreover, the same motif is
  connected with the symbol of the knot, whose cosmo-
- logical meaning lies in the fact that the harder one pulls
 16   In fact this motif is to be found in almost all Romanesque churches.

of 1550 in Basle University
Library.




on the knot, the more firmly its two constituents hold
together. This illustrates inter alia the mutual paralysis of
the two forces when in a state of 'chaos'. 16
Sometimes one of the two reptiles representing Sulphur
and Quicksilver is winged, whereas the other is without
wings. Or, instead of two reptiles, there are a lion and a
dragon in combat. The absence of wings always refers
to the 'firm' nature of Sulphur, whereas the winged
animal, be it a dragon, a griffin, or an eagle, represents
'volatile' Quicksilver. 17 The lion, which conquers the
dragon, corresponds to Sulphur, which 'fixes' Quick­
silver. A winged lion, or leogriffin, can represent the
union of the two natures, and has the same meaning as
the image of the male-female androgyne.


16   This explains the role of knots in magic.
17   See Senior Zadith, Turba Philosophorum. Bihl. des phil. chim.
Finally, the dragon alone can represent all phases of the
work, depending on whether it is provided with feet, fins,
or wings, or is without any limbs whatsoever. It can be
considered as able to live either in water, air, or on the
earth, and, as a salamander, even in fire. The alchemical
symbol of the dragon thus closely resembles that of the
Far-Eastern world-dragon, which first lives as a fish in
water, and then, as a winged creature, soars into the
heavens. It also recalls the Aztec myth of Quetzalcoatl,
the plumed serpent, which successively moves under the
earth, on the earth, and in the heavens.
All these correspondences with the animal images of
alchemy have been mentioned in order to show how a
cosmological wisdom of the most general bearing is
reflected in alchemy, in a particular way and within
specific limits.
                        CHAPTER IO


   SULPHUR, QUICKSILVER, AND SALT

It is in virtue of their nature and of the part they play in
the metal worker's craft that the two chemical substances
normally called Sulphur and Quicksilver are taken as
the symbols of the two basic generative forces. They act
on metals, but are themselves volatile 'spirits'. Quicksilver
in particular can be either solid, liquid, or gaseous. It
belongs to the 'bodies', to the metals, and to. the 'spirits'.
The 'masculine' character of Sulphur can be seen in its
'fieriness', and also in the fact that it can 'fix' and 'colour'
volatile Quicksilver. The combination of the two pro­
duces cinnabar. 'Colouring' by Sulphur corresponds to
the conferring of form.
Common quicksilver exhibits a great 'desire' to combine
with related metals. With quicksilver, metal workers can
make gold and silver liquid. Quicksilver amalgam has
been used since early times to gild metal objects. After
application of the liquid amalgam, the quicksilver can
be eliminated by fire, and the gold remains. Gold can
also be extracted from other minerals by washing with
quicksilver. The meaning of the -alchemical solve et coagula
can already be seen in this artisanal example, as also the
decisive role of spiritual fire.
According to the same simile Quicksilver bears in itself
the 'germ of the sun', just as the primordial sea of materia
prima, which the Hindus calledprakriti, contains the golden
egg of the world - the hiranyagarbha of the Indian myth.
On the plane of the soul the primordial sea is none other
than the anima mundi. Quicksilver, which animates and
dissolves the inward 'metal', is in a sense the surf of this
primordial sea, which, as the mother of all things, remains
                                                           IQQ

ungraspable. For this reason Quicksilver is also known
as 'maternal blood' (menstruum), for, when it does not flow
'outwards' and perish, it nourishes the germ in the
alchemical womb or 'athanor'.
Having in mind the fact that Sulphur in a certain sense
corresponds to the Spirit and Quicksilver to the soul,
confusion may arise from the fact that almost all the
alchemists call Quicksilver a spiritus ('spirit'), while some
of them (for example, Basilius Valentinus) compare Sul­
phur to anima ('soul'). This contradicts what has been
said above only in appearance; for in the language of
these authors anima signifies the immortal soul, thus the
essential and immutable 'form' of man, while the expres­
sion spiritus does not mean the transcendent spirit or
intellectus agens, but the 'vital spirit', that subtle power
which unites the individual soul with the body and the
corporeal world as a whole. The vital spirit corresponds
14.0
to Quicksilver because it is only partially and loosely
attached to the sphere of the ego, and thus represents a
still formable materia. The Arabic expression ru!J,. can also
have the same meaning. It is used in this sense by the
cosmologists, regardless of the fact that the same word
also designates the metaphysical spirit. The reason for
this double meaning may be that spiritus like rulJ, (and also
the Hebrew rua�) recalls the movement of the air or the
breath (the Arabic for 'wind' is rz�). On the one hand this
can represent the creative breath of the Universal Spirit
and on the other the mobility of the 'vital spirit' and its
connection with the subtle 'atmosphere' of this world.
The 'vital spirit' extends throughout cosmic �space'. It is
taken in by beings as is the air in breathing. It is the
constant nourishment of the subtle 'body' of their vital
powers.
The Hindus call this power prana. Certain North American
Indian tribes call it orenda. 1 It can be fixed by means of a
spiritual art. For the Hindu Shaivas it is the Shakti.
If on the basis of the alchemical descriptions one seeks to
determine what exactly is meant by Quicksilver, whether
it belongs to the realm of the body or of the soul, whether
it has merely a subjective or also a cosmic bearing, one
can easily lose every leading thread, if one does not know
that it lies in the esserice of alchemy - as also of other
similar methods - always to approach the soul's domain
from its corporeal landmarks, and the Universal from its
concrete, existential traces.
On the corporeal level, Quicksilver is present in blood
and semen. On a somewhat higher level - intermediate
between body and soul - it is in the heart and in the breath.
1 See Paul Coze, L' Oiseau-Tonnere, Paris-Geneva, 1938. According to
Averroes, who bases himself on Galen, the vital spirit is a pure sub­
stance present in stellar space, which is assimilated by means of a
process similar to breathing, and is changed into life in the heart.
The latter is so to say the bearer of the 'substance' of the
soul. Its rhythm is the image of the 'solidification' of this
substance within the field of force of the ego..consciousness,
and of its eventual dissolution in the All. The substance
of the soul, for its part, is the bearer of a spiritual reality.
According to the Chinese master Ko Ch'ang.. Keng, 2 who
incorporated alchemy into Dhyana (Zen) Buddhism, the
action of Quicksilver can be conceived of in three ways:
according to the first conception, Quicksilver is the heart,
which is made liquid by meditation ( dhyana) and fiery
by the sparks of the Spirit, while lead, which it can
transmute, corresponds to the body. According to the
second conception, Quicksilver is the soul, and lead the
breath, and according to the third Quicksilver is the
blood and lead is the semen. In each case Quicksilver has
the role of the dissolving and animating element. In the
last analysis it is the substance which 'flows' in all psychic
and mental forms. The Hindu alchemists call Quick­
silver the 'semen of Shiva'. Shiva is God as Author of all
transmutation. 3
Perhaps the reader will ask how one can in any way prove
what, in inward alchemy, is reality, and what mere
imagination. The criterion of this lies in alchemical
realization itself, which in the last analysis does not add
any new content to human consciousness, but rather
uncovers its very substance, which precedes all experi..
ences. For want of a better expression one can call this
'the acquiring of a consciousness of being'. Being is neither
'objective' nor 'subjective', but includes both or stands
above both. Consciousness of being is also of necessity a
knowledge of unity, for unum et esse convertuntur.

a See Mircea Eliade, Forgerons et alchimistes, chapter on Chinese
alchemy.
a See Mircea Eliade, op. cit., chapter on Indian alchemy.
  In the first instance Quicksilver is only a manifestation of
  materia prima. In the last analysis, however, it is materia
· prima itself. In Fra Marcantonio's book The Light which
  Proceeds from Darkness it is said, 'I know well that your
  secret Quicksilver is nothing other than a living, omni­
  present and innate spirit which, in the form of an aery
  haze (a subtle influence) continually descends from
  heaven to earth (and to earthly man), in order to fill
  earth's porous body. I know that it is subsequently born
  among the impure Sulphurs ( the corporeal substances),
  so that, having had a volatile nature, it may acquire a
  firm (i.e. immutable) one, and that by doing this it
  takes on the form of primordial humidity (humiditas
  rad.zcat·is) .•. ,4
  Sulphur has apparently two contradictory aspects: as the
  formative cause it effects in the first place the coagulation
  of the 'substance' or 'body' which is to be transmuted,
  and thus also its dryness and hardness. It thus appears as
  a hindrance to purification, and only when the 'sub­
  stance' has been completely dissolved out of its coagula­
  tion, does Sulphur reveal itself as the creative cause of the
  new and 'noble' form. The dissolution is brought about
  by Quicksilver. Thus in the first instance the latter works
  at cross purposes with Sulphur, wresting the 'substance'
  from the former, in order subsequently to offer 'herself' to
  'him' as a newer, unlimited and more receptive substance.
  From the psychological point of view, this is the same as
  when the attraction of feminine nature dissolves masculine
  nature from its torpor and at the same time calls forth,
  as a result of the tension between the two poles, its truly
  masculine and active power. There is a tantric method
  which operates this alchemical process by increasing the
  natural attraction between man and woman to the most

   extreme degree, and then spiritually revaluating it,
   similarly to the Fedeli d' Amore (to whom Dante
   belonged), who also knew and practised such a method. 5
   In the Chemical Marriage of Christian Rosenkreut;:, by Johann
  Valentin Andreae the following allegory is related: a
  beautiful unicorn, white as snow, wearing a golden collar,
  approaches a fountain and kneels down, bending his
  forelegs, as if he wished to honour the lion standing on the
  fountain. This lion, which at first, because of its immobi­
  lity, seems to be of stone or ore, immediately seizes a
 shining sword that it had been holding under its paws,
 and breaks it in two. Both parts fall into the fountain.
 Then it roars unceasingly, until a white dove with an
 olive branch flies towards it. The dove gives the lion the
 olive branch. The lion devours it and is silent. The unicorn
 returns with a few happy jumps to his place. The snow..
 white unicorn, a lunar animal, is Quicksilver in its pure
 state. The lion is Sulphur, which at first, as the essential
 form of the body, seems as rigid as a statue. It is awakened
by the homage of Quicksilver and begins to roar. I ts
voice is its creative power. According to the Physiologos
the lion brings its still-born sons to life by means of its
voice. It breaks the sword of reason, and the fragments of
the latter fall into the fountain, where they dissolve. The
lion only falls silent again after the dove of the Holy
Spirit has given him to eat the olive branch of Divine
Knowledge.
In a certain sense, 'rigid' Sulphur is theoretical under...

form. It must first be dissolved in Quicksilver before it can
become a living 'ferment' which can transmute other
metals. That is to say, it must be liberated from its con­
ceptual limitations, and become wholly 'active'.
The dissolving and disintegrating power of Quicksilver
has a terrible aspect. It is the 'poisonous dragon' which
devours everything; it is the water which makes one
shudder and which brings the presentiment of death.
Artephius writes: 'The whole secret lies in our knowing
how to extract non-burning Quicksilver from the body
of Magnesia ... , that is to say, one must extract a living
and incombustible water and then coagulate it with the
perfect body of the sun, which dissolves in this water into
a white creamy substance, until everything is white. At
first, however, the sun will lose its splendor, be extin­
guished, and become black, as a result of the putrefaction
and dissolution (resolutio) which it undergoes in this

 the 'water of life' (aqua vitae) and the spring in which sun
 and moon, spirit and soul must bathe in order to be
 rejuvenated. All this is also said of materia prima, for Quick­
 silver is its most direct psychic manifestation and all
 epithets applicable to the former can also be transposed
 to the latter. Synesius writes: ' ... lay aside what is mixed
 and take up the simple, for the latter is the quintessence
 of the former. Remember that we possess two very perfect
 bodies (gold and silver, spirit and soul, heart and brain),
which are both filled with QuicksilveL Extract our Quick­

power to produce this water by means of any art, as
Nature alone can generate it. This water is also the very
strong vinegar which makes a pure spirit from the body

for they are all vain except this water which burns,
bleaches, dissolves, and freezes. It alone has the power to
putrefy and to germinate ...' 7

 As the whole alchemical work has Quicksilver as its means
 and point of departure, Sulphur and Quicksilver are
 sometimes called the 'double' masculine-feminine Mer•
 cury. When the nature of Sulphur achieves its develop-­
 ment in Quicksilver, it is represented by the sign 9. The
 lunar crescent is here replaced by the horns of the
 'igneous' Ram (Aries) of the Zodiac. This is the 'igneous
water' and the 'non-burning fire'.
As has already been mentioned, 'living gold' is generated
by the perfect union of Sulphur and Quicksilver. From
another point of view, however, each metal consists of
three components, namely, Sulphur, Quicksilver, and
Salt. 'Wherever there is metal', says Basilius Valentinus,
'there are Sulphur, Quicksilver, and Salt ... spirit, soul
and body.' Thus these three powers or principles together
constitute the nature of metal -or of man. Salt is in a sense
the static, and thus also the neutral, element of the
ternary.
Transposed to man, salt is not simply the body in its
outward and visible form; it is its psychic form, and as
such has a twofold aspect: on the one hand, that of
limitation, and on the other, that of a symbol.
Sulphur produces combustion, Quicksilver evaporation.
Salt is the ash that remains over and serves to fix the
'volatile' spirit.
Not only in alchemy, but also in the various contemplative
methods of East and West, purified bodily consciousness
plays the role of a 'fixative' or support for a higher state
of the spirit, which in its breadth and originality eludes all
conceptual limi�ation. That the body, freed of the fevers
of passion, can serve as the support for such a contem•
plative state, rests both on its relatively static character,
which stands out like a solid pillar in the constantly
flowing current of psychic appearances, and also on the
fact that, in contrast to the purely subjective contents of
consciousness, it represents the so to say objective inter­
section between the human microcosm and the macro­
cosm. In a sense the body is the most clearly circumscribed,
outward and simple of all reflections of the cosmos. The
lowest corresponds to the highest, says the law enunciated
in the 'Emerald Tablet'.
                      CHAPTER I I


       OF THE 'CHEMICAL MARRIAGE'

 The marriage of Sulphur and Quicksilver, Sun and Moon,
 King and Queen, is the central symbol of alchemy. It is
 only on the basis of the interpretation of this symbol that
 a distinction can be made between, on the one hand,
alchemy and mysticism, and, on the other, between
alchemy and psychology.
Speaking in general terms, mysticism's point of departure
is that the soul has become alienated from God and
turned towards the world. Cons�quently the soul must be
reunited with God, and this it does by discovering in
itself His immediate and all-illuminating presence. AI...
chemy, on the other hand,.is based on the view that man,
as a result of the loss of his original 'Adamic' state, is
divided within himself. He regains his integral nature
only when the two powers, whose discord has rendered
him impotent, are again reconciled with one another.
This inward, and now 'congenital', duality in human
nature is moreover a consequence of its fall from God,
just as Adam and Eve only became aware of their opposi-
tion after the Fall and were expelled into the current of
generation and death. Inversely, the regaining of the
integral nature of man (which alchemy expresses by
the symbol of the masculine-feminine androgyne) is the
prerequisite - or, from another point of view, the fruit -
of union with God.
 If the distance - and the relationship - between man and
 God is represented by a vertical line, then the distance
 between man and woman, or between the two corre­
sponding powers of the soul, is represented by a horizontal
 line - which results in a figure like an inverted T. At the

 point where the two opposed forces are balanced, that is
 to say, at the centre of the horizontal line, the latter is
 the touched by vertical axis, descending from God, or rising
 up to God. This corresponds to the supra-formal spirit,
 which unites the soul with God.
 Although, following this image, the two forces or poles of
 human nature (the Sulphur and Quicksilver of the inward
alchemical work) lie on the same level, there is neverthe­
less a difference of rank, similar to that of the right and
left hands, so that the masculine pole can be said to be
placed above the feminine. And indeed Sulphur, as the
masculine pole, plays a role towards Quicksilver, the
feminine pole, which is similar to that of the spirit in its
action on the whole souL
As all active knowledge belongs to the masculine side of
the soul, and all passive being to its feminine side, thought..
dominated (and therefore clearly delimited) consciousness
can in a certain sense be ascribed to the masculine pole,
while all involuntary powers and capacities connected
with life as such, appear as an expression of the feminine
pole. This would seem to resemble the distinction made in
modern psychology between the conscious and the uncon­
scious.. There is therefore a temptation to interpret the
'chemical marriage' (the expression is that of Valentin
Andreae) simply as an 'integration' of unconscious powers
of the soul into the ego-consciousness, as is claimed by the
so-called 'depth psychology'.
In order to judge how far this interpretation is right, and
to what extent it requires correction, it is necessary to
recall the three-sided relationship that was represented
above by an inverted T. True union of the two powers of
the soul can only take place at that point where the
supra-formal spirit, the Divine Ray, touches their common
leveL This· means, however, that what man regards as
his own 'I' can never become the axis of a real 'integra­
tion', for, according to all spiritual traditions, the 'I'
which modern psychology regards as the real kernel of
'personality', is precisely the barrier which prevents
consciousness from being flooded by the light of Pure
Spirit, or, in other words, which hides the Spirit from our
consciousness. Thus the 'chemical marriage' is not an

Gallen.
'individuation', at any rate not in the sense of an inward
process by means of which the ego imprints on a wave
of collective instincts its own particular form - a form
necessarily limited, both temporally and qualitatively.
It may well be that the influx of hitherto unconscious
influences may widen the ego-consciousness, for this lies
within the range of an ordinary sublimation in the
psychological sense of the word. Nevertheless this has
quite definite limitations, which are in fact those .of
ordinary ego-consciousness.
Human consciousness can only attain dominion over the
undulating sea of the unconscious with the awakening of
a creative power within it which derives from a higher
sphere than that of ego-consciousness. This higher sphere
is also unconscious, but only provisionally so, from the
point of view of ordinary consciousness, for in itself it is
pure undivided light. This light is inaccessible to psycho­
logical observation, both in its essence and in all its
emanations, for psychology, like all empirical sciences, is
subject to reason, acting on its own, and reason can no
more penetrate beyond itself to its luminous source, than
a mirror can throw light on the sun. It is thus quite vain
to wish to describe psychologically the real essence of
alchemy or the secret of the 'chemical marriage'. The
more one strives to dispense with symbols and to replace
them with scientific concepts of one sort or another, the
more ra:pidly does that spiritual presence vanish which is
the very heart of the matter, and which can only be
trans�itted by symbols, whose nature is conceptually
inexhaustible.
In a sense, therefore, ego..consciousness lies between two
unconscious realms, one below, which in its latent and
as yet unformed nature can never become completely
conscious, and one above, which only appears as uncon--
,sc1ous 'from below'. To the extent that the supra-­
 conceptual light acts on the realm of the soul, the
 'natural' power of the 'lower' consciousness is tamed and
 assimilated.
 The alchemical process has thus a dual and ambiguous
 aspect, since the development of the two fundamental
 powers of the soul (masculine Sulphur and feminine
 Quicksilver), brought about by spiritual concentration,
 is able t� reflect the non-conceptual Spirit to the extent
that it includes the involuntary, and in this sense natural,
realms. The reason for this is that Nature, in her non­
conceptual and more or less unconscious or involuntary
aspect, is the inverse image of the creative spirit, in
accordance with the words of the 'Emerald Tablet', that
whatever is above is like that which is below, and vice
versa. Thus the fundamental masculine and feminine
powers are anchored in the unconscious and instinctive
nature of man. The two powers experience their full
development on the plane of the soul, but realize their
fulfilment only in the spirit, for only here does feminine
receptivity attain its broadest breadth and its purest
purity, and is wholly united to the victorious masculine
Act.
The other way round it can be said that involuntary
nature, rooted in the unconscious, only attains her living
unity to the extent that the supra--conceptual Spirit acts
on her. The ray of the Spirit acts on original nature like a
magic word, nor does this apply merely to inward nature,
the nature of the soul (shut off from the outward psychic
'atmosphere' not so much by the body as by the con-­
ceptual ego-bound consciousness): indeed the direct
presence of the Spirit in man acts on the whole subtle
or psychic ambiance, and through this penetrates, to a
greater or lesser extent, into the corporeal ambiance also.
  This explains, amongst other things, certain miracles
  which occur in the proximity of saints.
  Let us return to our original symbol of an inverted T, and
  amplify it to a cross. The upper part of the vertical axis
  obviously indicates the origin of spiritual light. The lower
 part reaches down into the darkness of unconscious
 nature. The two horizontal arms 'measure' the develop­
 ment of the two polar powers of the soul, which alchemy
 calls Sulphur and Quicksilver. It can now be said that
 through the reconciliation or marriage of these two
 initially hostile forces, the opposition between 'above'
 and 'below' also disappears, to the extent, in fact, that
 the darkness is dispelled by light. If the two forces are
 represented by two serpents, winding themselves up the
 vertical axis of the cross, until at the level of the horizontal
 arms they finally meet and embrace one another in the
centre, subsequently being transmuted into a single
serpent fastened upright to the cross, then one has a
picture of how 'dark' nature is transmuted into 'light'
nature.
The marriage of the masculine and feminine forces
finally merges into the marriage of Spirit and soul, and
as the spirit is the 'Divine in the human' - as is written in
the Corpus Hermeticum - this last union is related also to
mystical marriage. Thus one state merges into another.
The realization of the fullness of the soul leads to the
abandonment of soul to spirit, and thus the alchemical
symbols have a multiplicity of interpretations. Sun and
Moon can represent the two powers in the soul (Sulphur
and Quicksilver); at the same time they are the symbols
of Spirit and souL
Closely related to the symbolism of marriage is that of
death. According to some representations of the 'chemical
marriage' the king and queen, on marriage, are killed and
 buried together, only to rise again rejuvenated. That this
 connection between marriage and death is in the nature
 of things, is indicated by the fact that, according to
 ancient experience, a marriage in a dream means a death,
 and a death in a dream means a marriage. This corre­
 spondence is explained by the fact that any given union
presupposes an extinction of the earlier, still differentiated,
state. In the marriage of man and woman, each gives up
part of his or her independence, whereas, the other way
round, death (which in the first instance is a separation)
is followed by the union of the body with the earth and
of the soul with its original essence.
On 'chemical marriage' Quicksilver takes unto itself
Sulphur, and Sulphur, Quicksilver. Both forces 'die', as
foes and lovers. Then the changing and reflective moon
of the soul unites with the immutable sun of the spirit so
that it is extinguished, and yet illumined, at one and the
same time.
                       CHAPTER I 2


          THE ALCHEMY OF PRAYER

 In so far as alchemy contains a science of Nature - the
 latter comprising both gross or corporeal and subtle or
 psychic manifestation - its laws and concepts can be freely
 transposed to the domains of the other traditional sciences,
for example, to humoral medicine (which regards the
human organism as an indivisible whole), and also to the
corresponding science of the soul and its related thera..
peutics. More important to us in the present connection
is the transposition of alchemical perspectives to mysti..
cism, for it offers a parallel to what was said earlier
regarding the 'chemical marriage'. Here only brief men­
tion of this particular transposition will be made, by way
of indication and amplification, without attempting to
pursue all its ramifications.
Within the framework of mysticism, alchemy is above all
the alchemy of prayer. By the word prayer is to be under­
stood not so much an individual petition, but rather the
inward - and sometimes also outward - pronouncing of a
formula or name directed to God and evoking God, thus
especially the so..called 'ejaculatory prayer'. The pre­
excellence of this kind of prayer rests on the fact that the
word or phrase repeated as a means of concentration is
not one which has been selected by some human being
or other, but either derives wholly from revelation or
contains a Divine Name (if indeed it does not consist
exclusively of this Name). Thus the word pronounced by
the person praying is, thanks to its divine.origin, a symbol
of the eternal Word and, in the last analysis, in view of its
content and power of benediction, is one with the latter:
'The foundation of this mystery (that is, the invocation of
  a Divine Name) is, on the one hand, that "God and his
  Name are on�" (Ramakrishna), and on the other, that
  God Himself pronounces His Name in Himself, hence in
 eternity and outside of all creation, so that his unique
 and uncreated word is the prototype of ejaculatory prayer,
 and even, in a less direct sense, of all prayer.' (Frithjof
 Schuon, Stations of Wisdom. 1)
 Thus, fundamentally, the Divine Name or the sacred
 formula of ejaculatory prayer is related to the passive
 soul, as is the Divine Word, the fiat lux, to the passive
 nature or materia prima of the world. This brings us back
 to the correspondence (mentioned by Muhyi 'd-Din ibn
 tArabi) that exists between, on the one hand, the Divine
 Command (al-amr) and Nature (tabta!J,), and, on the other,
 Sulphur and Quicksilver, the two fundamental powers
 which in the soul are (respectively) relatively active and
relatively passive. In its immediate sense, and from the
 point of view of 'method', Sulphur is the will, which
unites itself with the content of the word pronounced in
the prayer, and acts in a formative manner upon the
 Quicksilver of the receptive soul. In the last analysis,
however, Sulphur is the penetrating spiritual light con­
tained in the sacred words, like the fire in flint, and
whose appearance effects the real transmutation of the
soul.
This transmutation goes through the same phases as are
determined by the alchemical work, for the soul initially
becomes congealed on turning away from the outward
world, then dissolves as a result of inner warmth, and
finally, having been a changing, volatile stream of im­
pressions, becomes a motionless crystal filled with light.
- This is indeed the simplest expression to which this
1 Published by John Murray, London, 1961. Chapter entitled 'Modes
of Prayer'.
 inward process can be reduced. If it were to be described
 in greater detail, it would be necessary to repeat almost
 everything that has been said in this book about the
alchemical work, and to relate it to the inward action of
 prayer and within the framework of corresponding
spiritual contemplation. 2
It will suffice here to mention that the alchemy of prayer
is treated particularly fully in the writings of the Islamic
mystics. 3 Here it stands in close relation to the method of
dhikr, an Arabic expression which can be translated as
'remembrance', 'recollection', and 'mention', and also as
'ejaculatory prayer'. 'Remembrance' is intended here in
the sense of the Platonic anamnesis: 'The sufficient reason
for the invocation of the (Divine) Name lies in its being
the ''remembering'' of God; and this, in the last analysis,
is consciousness of the Absolute. The Name actualizes this
consciousness and, in the end, perpetuates it in the soul
and fixes it in the heart, so that it penetrates the whole
being and at the same time transmutes and absorbs it ... '
(Frithjof Schuon, op. cit.)
The basic law of this kind of inward alchemy is to be
found in the Christian formula of the Ave Maria, the
'angelical salutation'. Maria corresponds both to materia
prima and to the soul in its state of pure receptivity, whereas
the words of the angel are like a prolongation of the
divine fiat lux. The 'fruit of the Virgin's womb' corre­
sponds to the miraculous elixir, the Philosophers' Stone,
which is the goal of the inward work.
According to the medieval interpretation, the angel
greets the Virgin mutans Evae nomen : Ave is indeed the
reverse of Eva. This indicates the transmutation of the

Lahore, 1959.
chaotic soul into the pure mirror of the Divine Word.
To the objection that the angel did not speak Latin, and
that Eva in Hebrew is Khawwa, it must be answered that
in the domain of the sacred there, is no chance, and also
that things which seem mere coincidences are in reality
preordained. This explains why in the Middle Ages the
smallest details of Scripture, even the very names, were
studied and variously interpreted according to their
symbolism - and with an inspiration which rebuffs every
reproach of artificiality.
                           CHAPTER I       3

                       THE ATHANOR

 'Athanor', from the Arabic at-tannur ('oven'), is the word
 used by the alchemists to designate the oven in which the
 elixir is prepared. In alchemical manuscripts it is usually
 portrayed in the form of a small tower surmounted by a
 dome. It contains the glass vessel (usually egg-shaped)
which lies in a sand-bath or ash-pit situated immediately
above the fire. All of this has both a literal and a symbolical
meaning, for although it is certain that ovens of this shape
were in fact used for all sorts of chemical and metallurgical
operations, the real athanor - as far as the 'Great Work'
was concerned - was none other than the human body,
and thus also a simplified image of the cosmos.
That the oven of the alchemists is reminiscent of the human
body has already been noted by other modern writers on
alchemy. 1 It is misleading, however, to try to establish
this likeness on an anatomical basis, as, from the 'metho­
dic' viewpoint of alchemy, the 'body' does not mean the
visible and tangible body, but a tissue of powers of the
soul which have the body as their support, and which are
accessible via bodily consciousness. When it is said that
love dwells in the heart, this assumes a relationship
between soul and body similar to the one which, in a much
more subtly graduated manner, lies at the basis of the
alchemical symbol of the athanor. In this, the threefold
envelope ( consisting of earthen oven, ash-pit, and glass
vessel) refers to so many envelopes or 'levels' of bodily or
vital consciousness.
The most important element in the oven is the fire. The
1See: H. K. Iranschar, Enthiillung der Geheimnisse der wahren Alchemie,
Zurich.
                           Athanor, from the 'Mutus Liber'.




 alchemists stress that the heat which transmutes the
 materia contained in the glass must be threefold, namely,
 the open heat of the fire, the evenly distributed heat of
 the ash-- or sand-bath (in a trough of which the glass
 vessel lies like an egg in the nest), and finally the latent
heat that is actualized in the substance itself, a heat which
thereafter becomes active in its own right. (The latter is
what would today be called - on a purely physical level -
 the heat of the chemical reaction.)
The fire clearly corresponds to the generative power,
which is first aroused and then tamed in order to serve
inward contemplation. From this it can at once be under-­
stood why the alchemists have always warned against a
violent or unsteady fire. A violent flame might well
consume the ':flowers of gold'. The indirect warmth of the
ash-pit, on the other hand-which must be 'mild, envelop­
ing, and penetrating' - signifies the concentration of the
soul, which is indirectly brought about and maintained
by the 'open' fire. Ash is burned living material which
can no longer be set on fire - that is to say, which is no
longer attainable by the passions. It is sometimes said that
the ashes must be of oak wood. The oak is a symbol of
Athanor, from the book by Basilius Valentinus .· 'Concerning the
Great Stone of the Ancients . . . ' Leipzig M. DC. J ii.

man, and especially of the human body. Finally, the
warmth which develops in the enclosed materia and which
according to the alchemists, is already present in all
bodies and substances, and only has to be awakened, is a
symbol of the most inward vital force.
The alchemical masters also speak of three fires: an
artificial, a natural, and an 'anti-natural'. These corre­
spond to the distinction between methodic contemplation,
the 'vibration' of the soul which is set in motion by the
former, and the spontaneously occurring intervention of
the Spirit, which is also described as an 'incombustible
sulphur', and is a mode of grace.
The fire is invigorated both by a current of air which
enters through the air hole� in the oven, and by the use of
bellows. This is an indication that, in spiritual concentra­
tion as practised by the alchemists, the regulation of the
breath played a part, just as in yoga.
The fact that the hermetic vessel or 'egg' is made of glass
or crystal and is thus transparent indicates its connection
with the soul. It is none other than consciousness deflected
from the outer world and turned inwards, thus consti­
tuting, so to say, ·an isolated sphere. During 'boiling' it
must remain 'hermetically sealed'. The powers which are
developed in it must not leak out, if the work is to succeed.
Depending on the process which it is intended to serve,
the Hermetic vessel can have various forms. It can be
constricted in the middle like a cucurbit. It can have one
or more b�lbous protuberances. It can __ consist of a
sinter-basin or, for the 'dry' method, of an open crucible.
Each of these forms corresponds· both to �n arti:sanal use

of the Holy Trinity.
 and to a certain aspect of the spiritual work. The most
 general form of the vessel, however, is egg-shaped. The
position of the vessel in the human body corresponds to
the solar plexus.
The Hermetic egg is the microcosmic reflection of the
'world egg' ( hiranyagarbha) of Hindu mythology, which
represents the subtle 'germ' of the visible world. Like the
world egg, the Hermetic egg contains synthetically all
the elements and properties from which the corporeal
world develops. This is why the progress of the alchemical
work is compared with the creation of the world.
A unique counterpart to the alchemical oven is to be
found in the sacred pipe of the North American Indians,
which likewise represents the human body. Like the
athanor, it is not so much a 'picture' of the body as a kind
of paradigm of those vital powers and processes which
link the body with the world of the soul and also with
the whole cosmos. For the Indians the fire which burns
in the oven or-in the sacred pipe, is derived from the sun.
The materia, however, which it consumes and transmutes

quicksilver and salt and the 'volatile' and 'solid' (or spiritual and
corporeal) dragon of Nature. From Basilius Valentinus: 'Con­
cerning the Great Stone of the Ancients .   . .'
 into smoke, comes from everywhere, from all things and
 beings. Before filling the· pipe, the Indian priest distri­
 butes the tobacco on the different elements of a geo­
 metrical image of the universe, a kind of wind-rose. Then
 he places it in the pipe, invoking all the various cosmic
 powers which these elements represent, so that, by the
 sacrifice of smoking, the whole world, and also the whole
 human soul, may be transmuted. 2 The rising of the smoke
 symbolizes the ascension of the individual soul to the
Infinite, and thus corresponds to alchemical sublimation.
When the Indian at prayer offers his pipe first to the
heavens and then to the earth, this is analogous to the
alchemical 'spiritualization of the body and incorporation
of the spirit'. The fire in the sacred pipe is revived by the
breath. The canal of the pipe corresponds to the spinal
column or, more exactly, to the subtle canal which is the
channel of the vital spirit.
In contradistinction to the Hermetic vessel, in which
the materia only moves within a closed circuit, the bowl
of the sacred pipe is open. The smoke escapes. But even
in alchemy there is a process similar to this. According to
the so-called 'dry' method the materia is exposed directly
to the fire, and this method is the shortest, but also the
most dangerous, way to mastery.
The sacred pipe of the Indians is the prototype and
guarantee of the highest dignity of man, his capacity to
reconcile heaven with earth. The same sense, although
less obvious, is also present in the form of the athanor.

                              *
The following considerations, which may appear to

 depart from our subject, may be helpful in clarifying the
 mutual relationship of spirit and body. First of all let us
recall that in certain mental illnesses it is impossible to
determine whether the cause is mental or physical. In
 such cases, in fact, the disturbances of equilibrium follow
one another alternately. The mental illness results in
poisons accumulating in the body, and these in turn con­
fuse or paralyse the mind, without it being possible to
know whether the initial cause should be sought in the
mind or the body .. - Certain illnesses doubtless arise from
more fundamental causes. They are in a sense conditioned
by the human type.
Similar up to a point are the psychic states produced by
narcotics. Such states may have a spiritual content, but
only under particular conditions, because a narcotic can
do no more than induce an inward process, it cannot
determine its quality. When, in certain cults, intoxicating
drinks were used to promote extra--ordinary spiritual
states, it was not the intoxicating drink as such that
produced the state in question. Its role could only be
preparatory. The 'qualitative' impetus hatl to come from
a different realm.
Sexual maturity in man is not the real reason why he
recognizes beauty in woman. And yet the absence of this
maturity - as a result of a physical defect - may well mean
that a beauty which in itself is independent of sexual
attraction, will never penetrate the door of consciousness.
Finally it must be said that even the activity of the brain,
without which certain spiritual insights are unattainable,
is dependent on the body. Contrariwise, it is also possible
that unusual spiritual states, to which the mind as such
has not adapted, may temporarily or permanently damage
the brain. In this case - which is well known in all civil­
izations with a spiritual tradition - the content, so to say,
  breaks its vessel, and this proves, in a negative sense, how
 great an importance attaches to the physical foundation
  of a spiritual art.
 The natural interplay of spirit and body tempts the
 superficial observer towards materialism. Yet he who sees
 the true proportions of things will on the contrary attain
 to the insight that the two levels of reality correspond to
 one another as (spiritual) prototype and (bodily) reflec­
 tion. The whole cosmos is constructed symbolically. The
 eye does not see because it is able in a certain manner to
 focus rays· of light; it sees because, on the corporeal level,
 it reflects the spiritual eye; this is why it also has the same
 shape as the heavenly bodies. The ear hears, because it
 resembles cosmic space, in which the eternal Word
 resounds. The acoustic law, according to which it is
 formed, is but an expression of the same prototype. So
 also it is that the inward faculties work only by virtue of
 their symbolic consonance with higher realities. The

things if it did not, on the plane of the soul, resemble the
eternal permanency of the principial possibilities in the
Divine Spirit. The imagination would be meaningless if
it did not, in its own way, participate in the plastic
capacity of materia prima, and words would have no
meaning if the Spirit were not the Word of God.
It is thus inherent in the nature of a sacred art, which
naturally proceeds in symbolical fashion, to -draw the
body into its works, and even to make it its 'methodic'
basis. Ascetic contempt for the body applies only to the
body as the seat of the passions, and, not to the body as
symbol.

         THE STORY OF NICOLAS FLAM.EL
           AND HIS WIFE PERRENELLE

By way of illustrating what has already been said, and as
a preparation for what still remains to be said, a trans-­
lation - with brief commentary - of the famous story of
Nicolas Flame! and his wife Perrenelle is reproduced
below. This story constitutes the first part of Flamel's
own book On the hieroglyphic figures which he had depicted in
the Cemetery of the Holy Innocents in Paris. 1
Records and documents have been conserved concerning
Flamel's life. He was born in Pontoise in 1330 and worked
in Paris as a writer and notary public. His office was at
first situated beside the charnel house of the Cemetery of
the Holy Innocents and later near the Church of Saint..
Jacques�la-Boucherie, where he himself was buried in
 1417. His tomb is preserved in the Cluny museum.
Flamel's account is concerned principally with the primus
agens of the alchemical work, about which Synesios says:
'Concerning the primus agens the philosophers have always
spoken only in parables and symbols, so that their science
might not be accessible to fools; for if that were to
happen, all would be lost. It should be available only to
patient souls and refined spirits, who have withdrawn
themselves from the corruption of the world and have
purified themselves from the slimy filth of avarice . . . '
Nicolas Flamel's own story begins as follows:
'During the time when, after the death of my parents, I
earned my living by our art of writing - making inven-­
tories, preparing accounts, and calculating the expenses
of guardians and their wards - I acquired for two florins
1   Bihl. des phil. chim.
 a very old, large, and finely gilded book. It was neither of
 paper nor of parchment as are other books, but seemed
 to me to be made of the smoothed-out bark of young
 trees. I ts binding was of beaten copper and it was engraved
 with strange letters and figures - I think they were Greek
 letters or letters of some similar ancient language. At any
 rate I could not read them, but I know they were not
 Latin or Gallic letters, for I understand something of
 these. Inside, the pages of bark had been engraved very
 skilfully with an iron stylus and bore very beautiful and
 clear Latin letters which had been finely coloured. The
 book contained thrice-seven pages, for they were fastened
together (in sections) in this way, and the seventh page
was always without writing. On the first seventh page,
instead of writing, there was a picture of a staff, around
which two serpents were entwined. On the second seventh
 page there was a cross, on which was nailed a serpent.
On the last seventh page was represented a desert, in the
middle of which several beautiful fountains played, out
of which serpents sprang in all directions ... '
The thrice-seven pages of the book recall the three prin­
cipal phases of the work - blackening, whitening, and
reddening - and the seven planets or metals.
The staff around which two serpents are entwined is the
staff of Hermes, with the two forces - Sulphur and
Quicksilver - which govern the spiritual axis.
The crucified snake is the symbol of the fixation of volatile
Quicksilver - the first 'incorporation' of the spint. The
fixation of Quicksilver corresponds to the subjugation of
the ever-restless vital force, which dissipates itself in wish­
ing and imagining. At the same time it represents the
transmutation of time-dominated thought into a motion­
less and timeless consciousness. The cross on which the
serpent is nailed signifies the body, not as flesh and
sensuality, but as image of the cosnuc law, of the
motionless cosmic axis.
The fountains springing forth in the middle of a desert
or wilderness, from which serpents emerge, represent the
state of regained spiritual originality. All three pictures
are variants of the serpent symbol, which always repre­
sents the same power of the soul (or cosmic power) :
'Nature' or Shakti.
'On the first page of the book was written in large golden
capitals: ABRAHAM THE JEW, PRINCE, PRIEST, LEVITE,
ASTROLOGER AND PHILOSOPHER, TO THE JEWISH PEOPLE,
DISPERSED THROUGH GOD'S ANGER INTO GAUL, GREETINGS.

n.1. The rest of the page was filled with terrible curses
(in which the word MARANATHA frequently occurred)
against anyone who might read this book, unless he be
sacrificial priest or doctor of the Holy Law.
'The man who had sold me this book did not know its
value - any more than I did when I acquired it. I think it
must have been taken from the poor Jews, or perhaps it
had been found somewhere in one of their erstwhile
dwellings ... '
Flamel is perhaps referring here to one of the expulsions
of the Jews, which occurred several times at that epoch.
That the book should be ofJewish origin is significant, in
that the Jews were the natural link between the Christian
and Islamic worlds. It is known that the renascence of
alchemy in Europe in the later Middle Ages arose from
the influence of Islamic culture.
'On the second page the author consoled his people and
counselled them to eschew all vice, especially idolatry,
and to wait with meek patience until the Messiah should
come and conquer all kings on earth and with his people
rule eternally in majesty. Without doubt this was written
by a very learned man.
'On the third and following pages he taught, in simple
language, the transmutation of metals, in order to help
his captive people to pay their taxes to the Roman
emperor and to do other things that I will not mention.
Alongside, he provided illustrations of the vessels, and gave
details of the colours, and other matters, excepting always
the primus agens of which he did not speak. Instead he
painted this, with great skill, over the whole surface of
the fourth and fifth pages; and though it was very clearly
delineated and depicted, no one would have understood
it who w� not familiar with their tradition and had not
studied thoroughly the books of the philosophers. The
fourth and fifth pages were thus without writing, being
completely filled with beautiful and skilfully executed
miniatures.
'On the fourth page there was portrayed first of all a
youth with wings on his heels and a staff in his hand - a
caduceus entwined by two serpents - with which he
touched the helmet on his head. It seemed to me he
represented the pagan god l\1:ercury. Toward him ran
and flew a powerful old man, on whose head was an
hour-glass, and who carried a sickle in his hands - like
Death - with which, full of rage and fury, he tried to cut
off the feet of Mercury . . . '
That Mercury or Quicksilver can be robbed ofits volatility
by Saturn-Chronos or time, as Flame! himself says later
on, can have two different, and, in a certain sense, con­
trary interpretations, depending on whether time is
actively used or merely endured, and whether the fixation
of Quicksilver is seen as a slow death of its effective power
or as a taming of the latter. The hour-glass on Saturn's
head, however, seems to suggest that time is to be
mastered actively, by means of a rhythm which will
transmute it into an eternal now.
 'On the other side of the fourth page was portrayed a
 beautiful flower growing on the top of a high mountain
 and shaken violently by the north wind. It had a blue
 stalk, white and red flowers, and leaves shining like the
 finest gold. Round about it the northern dragons and
 griffins nested ... ,
The colours of the flower represent the three main phases
of the work and its two fruits, namely silver and gold.
Here blue takes the place of black, in keeping with the
nature of a flower, but with the same sense of darkness
and night. The flower grows on the lonely mountain of
essential Being, which is one with the world-mountain,
round which the heavens circle, through which the polar
axis runs, and round which glide the dragons of the cosmic
powers.
'On the fifth page was a rose-bush in flower, in the middle
of a beautiful garden and leaning on a hollow oak. At
the foot of the rose-bush gushed forth a spring of very
white water, which fell away in cascades into the distance,
after passing through the hands of countless peoples, who
dug in the earth to find the spring, but did not find it,
since they were blind, with the exception of one alone,
who weighed the water ... '
The spring of Quick.silver gushes forth from the 'earth'
of materia prima, at the roots of the flowering tree of the
soul, which is protected by the hollow oak trunk of the
body. The water of life flows everywhere, yet no one finds
it but the sage, who weighs it. One might have expected
that he would taste it, but the weighing of the water has
here the same meaning as the capture of Mercury by the
measure of time.
The alchemists also teach how to unite the individual
elements or the various natural properties with one
another, according to a definite relationship of their
    'weights'. Jabir ibn Hayyan calls this the art of the balance.
    And yet it may seem absurd to weigh elements, or even
    properties, such as hot, cold, moist, and dry. What is
    meant by alchemical 'weighing' can only be understood
    if one first transposes the outward, quantitative measure
    of weight into the inward, qualitative measure of time
    (i.e., rhythm). Alchemical weighing, which appears to
    refer to physical mass, is thus none other than the mastery
    of rhythm, by means of which the powers of the soul can
    be influenced. Rhythm plays an important role in all
    spiritual arts. In Arabic, the rhythm of a verse is known
    as its 'weight' (wazn).
    'On the other side of the fifth page was a king with a large
    knife, who, by means of soldiers standing round him,
    caused a large number of young children to be killed,
    whose mothers wept at the feet of the merciless armed men,
    while the flowing blood was gathered by other soldiers
    and put in a large vessel in which the sun and moon from
    heaven came to bathe. It was because this illustration
    recalled the story ?f the innocent children killed by Herod,
    and because it was from this _book that I learned the
    greater part of the art, that I had the hieroglyphic symbols
1




    of these secret sciences depicted in the Cemetery of the
    Holy Innocents. This is what appeared on the first five
    pages .•.'
    As Flamel himself writes in the following pages, the blood
    of the sacrificed innocents signifies 'the mineral spirit
    contained in all metals, and especially in gold, silver, and
    quicksilver'.- This is none other than the 'philosophic
    Quicksilver' which is the first manifestation of materia
    prima. Blood is the fundamental stuff of life. The holy
    innocents are like undefiled stirrings or out-breathings of
    the vital. spirit which, before they can develop into ego­
    conscious wills, are sacrified b the kin . in order to fill
  the vessel of the heart with their blood, so that sun and
  moon, spirit and soul, may bathe, be dissolved, and then
  united in it, and, having lost their old form, emerge from
 it rejuvenated.
  'I shall not relate what is written in beautiful and clear
 Latin on all the other pages, for God would punish .me for
 this, as I would be doing something worse than did he, of
 whom it is told, that he wished that all men on earth had
 a single head, so that he might cut it off with one stroke.
 'As I now had this beautiful book by me, I did nothing
 else during day and night but study it: I thus understood
 very well all the processes which it described,. but I did
 not know what was the material I must work on. This
 made me feel very sad and lonely and caused me to sigh
 incessantly. My wife Perrenelle, whom I loved like myself
and whom I had married only recently, was greatly
 concerned about this, and asked me continually if she
might not be able to release me from the concern which
obviously weighed upon me. I could hide nothing from
her, and told her everything, showing her the beautiful
book, with which she fell in love just as much as I had
done. Her greatest pleasure ,,vas to gaze on its beautiful
covers, engravings, pictures, and representations, of
which, however, she understood as little as did I. Never­
theless it was for me a great consolation to be able to
speak to her about it, and to discuss what might be done
in order to find the explanation of the signs.
'Finally I had all the figures on the fourth and fifth pages
copied in my house as faithfully as possible, and I showed
them to various scholars, who understood them ·no better
than myself. I even explained to them that these figures
had been taken from a book that taught the production of
the philosophers' stone; but most of them made fun of
me and the holy stone, with the exception of a certain
  Ivfaster Anselm, a licentiate in medicine, who studied this
 art diligently. He was very eager to see my book, and did
 everything he could to get a sight of it. I assured him,
 however, that I did not possess it, but I described to him
 fully what it contained. He told me that the first picture
 represented time, which devours all things, and that,
 following the number of pages in the book, it would
 require six years in order to perfect the stone. After this
 period, he asserted, one would have to turn over the hour­
glass, and boil no more. When I said to him that this
picture was meant to represent only the primus agens (as
was written in the book itself), he replied that each six­
year boiling was like a secundus agens. The primus agens, he
said, whose picture was before us, was without doubt
none other than that white and heavy water - namely
quicksilver - which could riot be grasped, and whose feet
could not be cut off, that is to say, whose volatility could
not be removed except by long boiling in the pure blood
of young children. In this blood quicksilver, uniting with
gold and silver, would first of all be transmuted into a
plant just like the one shown in the picture. Thereafter,
through putrefaction, it would be changed into serpents,
which, having been completely dried and cooked in the
fire, would disintegrate into golden powder - and this was
the philosophers' stone.
'It was the fault of this counsellor that, for the long period
of twenty-one years, I committed thousands of mistakes,
without, however, using blood, which would have been
cruel and villainous. For I had discovered from my book
that what the philosophers called blood was none other
than the mineral spirit contained in metals, principally in
the sun, moon, and Mercury, which I continually strove
to combine. The above-mentioned interpretations, how­
ever> were more ingenious than exact. Since, in all my
 activities, I never perceived the signs which, according
 to the book, should appear at a definite time, I had always
 to start again at the beginning. Finally, when I had lost
 all hope of ever understanding these figures, I made a
 vow to God and St James of Galicia, and decided to seek
 the explanation from some Jewish priest or other in one
 of the synagogues of Spain ... '
 St James the Elder, whose shrine is at Compostela, was
 the patron of alchemists, and also of all cosmological arts
 and sciences. It is certainly no coincidence that the
 pilgrim's staff (bourdon) of St James - a staff criss-crossed
 by two ribbons and crowned with a round knob, as can
 be seen in the saint's hand in the Romanesque statue at
 Compostela - bears a remarkable similarity ro the staff
of Hermes.
'I set forth, therefore, with the agreement of my wife
Perrenelle, bearing on me a copy of these figures, in pil­
grim's dress and with a pilgrim's staff, as I can be seen on
the outside of the chapel in the cemetery where I had the
hieroglyphic figures painted, and where also, on both
side walls, I had a procession depicted, in which all
colours of the stone are to be seen in order, appearing
and disappearing, along with the French inscription:
               a
Moult plaist Dieu Procession, s' elle est faite en devotion ('A
procession pleases God greatly, when it is accomplished
with devotion'). This inscription repeats almost literally
the beginning of the book of King Hercules, 2 which deals
with the colours of the stone and bears the title Iris:
operis processio multum naturae placet, etc. I chose these words
deliberately, knowing that the wise would understand
the allusion.
'In pilgrim's dress, then, I made my way, arriving finally
at Montjoye, whence I proceeded to St James of Corn­
s Herak.leios I, Emperor of Byz antium (610-q41).
postela, where with great devotion I discharged my vow.
Having done this, I departed and met on the way, in
Leon, a merchant from Boulogne who introduced me to
a doctor of Jewish origin but of Christian faith - called
Master Canches - who lived there and was renowned for
his learning. When I showed him the figures copied from
my book, he was overcome with astonishment and joy,
and asked me at once whether I knew anything of the
whereabouts of the book from which they were taken. I
answered in Latin (in which language he had questioned
me) and told him that, should someone solve these riddles
for me, I hoped to obtain exact information concerning
the book. At this he immediately began, with great zeal
and joy, to explain the beginning to me. In short, he was
happy to hear where the book was, and I to hear him
speak about it. He must already have heard a lot about
the book, but, as he told me, it had been thought to be
completely lost. We decided, therefore, to set out together.
From Leon we travelled to Oviedo, and from there to
Sanson where we boarded a ship for France. Our journey
proceeded h_appily, and well before we reached the latter
kingdom, he had truly explained to me most of my
figures, revealing even in mere points great secrets (which
I found most wonderful). But when we arrived at Orleans,
the Iearµed man became very ill, developing the most
severe vomiting which did not stop from the moment it
began at sea. He was very afraid that I might leave him,
which was quite understandable. Although I never left
his side, he called for me unceasingly. Finally he died, at
the end of the seventh day of his illness, which filled me
with sadness. I had him buried, as well as I could, in the
church of the Holy Cross in Orleans, where he rests to
this day. God keep his soul, for he died a good Christian.
If death does not prevent me, I will settle on that church
                                                        I7 Q
  a small rent, so that every day a few masses may be said
  for his soul.
  'Whoever would see how I arrived home and how
  Perrenelle rejoiced, let him look at us both in this city of
  Paris on the door of the chapel of Saint-Jacques de la
 Boucherie, on the side, and near my house. We are
 depicted there offering prayers· of thanksgiving, I at the
 feet of StJames of Compostela, and Perrenelle at the feet
 of St John, whom she had so often invoked. Thus, through
 God's grace and the intercession of the Blessed Virgin and
 SaintsJames andJohn, I had learned what I had wished
 to, namely, the first principles, though not their initial
 preparation, which is harder than anything in the world.
 This, however, I finally learned after making many
 mistakes over a period of about five years, during which
 I continually studied and worked - as one may see me
 on the outer wall of the chapel (on whose pillars I had the
 processions painted) at the feet of Saints James andJohn,
 ceaselessly praying to God, with my rosary in my hand,
 reading attentively in - a book, meditating on the words
 of the philosophers, and thereafter accomplishing the
 various operations which I had divined from their words.
 'Finally I found what I had longed for, and I recognized
 it at once by its strong smell; and when I had it, I
,accomplished the work (magistere). Having learned the
 preparation of the first powers (agens), I had only to
 follow my book word for word, and could not have gone
 wrong even had I wanted to. The first time I made the
 projection, I applied it to quicksilver, and transmuted
 about one and a half pounds of it into pure silver, which
 was better than that from the mine - a fact which I tested
 and had tested several times. This took place on the ·
 17th January 1382, a Monday, towards midday, in my
 house, in the presence of Perrenelle alone. Later, following
 1Ro
my book word for word, I accomplished the work with
the red stone on a similar quantity of quicksilver, again
in the sole company of Perrenelle, in the same house, on
the 25th day of April of the same year, at five o'clock in
the evening, when I truly transmuted the quicksilver into
almost the same amount of gold, which was clearly better
than ordinary gold,- in that it was softer and more
malleable. This I can say in truth. In this way I accom-­
plished the work three times with the help of Perrene-Ue,
who understood it just as well as I did myself, as- she
helped me in carrying out the instructions; and had she
wished to accomplish it entirely on her own; she would
certainly have reached the goaL I possessed more than
enough, after I had accomplished it once, but I found a
very great joy in seeing and beholding the wonderful
works of nature in the vessels . . . '
Man and woman, who in natural fashion incarnate the
two poles of the alchemical work (Sulphur and Quick•
silver), can by their mutual love - when this is spiritually
heightened and interiorized - develop ·that cosmic power,
or power of the soul, which operates the alchemical
dissolution and coagulation (solve et coagula).
                       CHAPTER I     5

          THE STAGES OF THE WORK

 There are various ways of subdividing the multiple stages
 of the alchemical work. Each of these is something of a
 schematic simplification of the total process; nevertheless
 each of them is right, in the sense that each one is an
 expression of the inner logic of the 'work'. The oldest
 subdivision is the one which designates the individual
stages or phases by different colours. This possibly goes
back to a particular metallurgical process, such as the
purification and colouring of metals. According to this
scheme, 'blackening' (melanosis, nigredo) of the materia or
'stone' is followed by bleaching (leukosis, albedo), and this,
in turn, is followed by '.reddening' (iosis, rubedo).
Black is the absence of colour and light. White is purity;
it is undivided light - light not broken down into colours.
Red is the epitome of colour, its zenith and its point of
greatest intensity. This ordering of things becomes even
more evident if, between white and red, a whole series
of intermediate colours, such as lemon-yellow, yellow­
ochre, and bright red, is inserted, or again, if one
speaks of a 'peacock's tail' of gradually unfolding
colours. In this case royal purple is always the seal of
each series.
It is to be noticed that the three principal colours, black,
white, and red (which are also to be found in Hermetically
influenced heraldry) designate in Hindu cosmolpgy the
three fundamental tendencies (gunas) of the primordial
materia (Prakriti). Here black is the symbolically 'down­
ward' movement (tamas), which flees the luminous Origin;
white is the 'upward' aspiration towards the Origin, to-­
wards the Light (sattva); and red is the tendency towards
182
expansion on the plane of manifestation itself (rajas).
With these interpretations in mind, one may be surprised
to find that in alchemy it is not white, but red, that
represents the final result of the work. According to the
Hindu doctrine the cosmos is so constructed that firstly
tamas, the downward-striving force, throws down the
anchor into darkness, then rajas, expanding in breadth,
develops multiplicity, and finally sattva, like an upward­
striving luminous flame, brings everything back to the
Origin. The mere comparison of the three alchemical
colourings with Hindu cosmology is already a clear
indication of the point of view of alchemy and the precise
limits of its symbolism. After the 'spiritualization of the
body' - which in a certain sense corresponds to bleaching,
and supersedes the initial blackness or corruption, comes,
as the completion, the 'embodying of the spirit' with its
royal purple-red colour. The same rhythm can also be
transposed to other modes of spiritual realization. The
significant point here is that the emphasis lies on the
manifestation of the Spirit and not on the transcending -
or the extinction - of limit-bound existence.
By means of putrefaction, fermentation, and trituration -
all of which take place in darkness - the materia is divested
of its initial form. By means of bleaching to a silvery
white it is purified, and by 'reddening' it is coloured anew
- and here colour stands for form. The purifying power is
Quicksilver, the 'colouring' power, Sulphur.
The threefold division according to colours does not
conflict with the twofold division into 'lesser' and 'greater'
works. This reflects the already described duality of
materia and forma, soul and spirit, moon and sun.
Both the threefold and the twofold divisions occur in the
sevenfold division based on the reigns (regimes) of the
planets and properties of the metals..
                                                          ...o,.,.
  There are two principal conceptions of the sevenfold
  gradation. In one of these, the 'lesser' and the 'greater'
  works are combined - something in fact practicable -
  so that silver and gold, moon and sun, as a pair, represent
  the end-point of the whole series, while the other planets
 or metals take their place in the series according to their
 nobility, that is to say, their greater or lesser relationship
 with gold, or the sun. This order corresponds to the
 hierarchy of planetary houses, as described in chapter 5.
 Its model is the ascent of the sun from its lowest position
 in the house of Saturn, the original winter solstice, to its
 domain in the house of Leo, which once represented the
·summer solstice. In the other conception, the 'lesser' work,
 with the moon as end-point, precedes the 'greater' work,
 the crowning-point of which is the sun. This latter con­
 ception, mentioned by Philaletes, Bernardus Trevisanus,
Basilius Valentinus, and other alchemists - and which
because of its particularly lucid form, will now be
examined in greater detail � appears as follows:

         �      '5        l       )         �        o     0
Mercury       Saturn   Jupiter   Moon     Venus    Mars   Sun
quicksilver   lead     tin       silver   copper   iron   gold

The sign of Mercury, which comes before all the others,
does not represent a stage in the work, but is rather a key
to the whole, so that the work in itself has only six phases.
Of these the first three are expressed by purely lunar and
the last three by purely solar signs. Only the sign for
Mercury or quicksilver is androgynous, formed of both
sun and moon.
It has already been said that for the alchemists quick­
silver is the primus agens, the true means of the work, the
all-dissolving water and nourishment for the spiritual
embryo. It is, so to say, the most direct manifestation of
... o.
   materia prima, seen as the fine, psychic stuff, or vital breath,
   which unites the individual body-soul organism with the
   cosmic sea of life. In it the germ of spiritual gold lies
   hidden, as does gold in ordinary quicksilver.
   Transposed to the 'operative' mode of mysticism, what
   appears at this point is the spiritual influence, grace, or
  other mode of operation of the Holy Spirit, which in a
  certain sense penetrates the apparently closed world of
  ego-consciousness from without, and dissolves it out of its
  metallic 'coagulation'. In alchemy, Quicksilver could be
  regarded as the 'cosmic blessing', which, as Fra Marc­
  antonio says, 'constantly falls from Heaven as a fine mist
  to fill the pores of the earth' 1; here 'pores' are what save
  solid bodies from fossilization and suffocation; it is
 through them that the earth 'breathes', just as man lives
 by remaining open to the celestial influences present in
 nature.
 The interpretation of the sign of Mercury as the key to
 the whole work is confirmed by the role of the God
 Mercury or Hermes in the Orphic mysteries. The mes­
 senger of the gods accompanied the soul after its death -
 bodily or mystical - through all the realms of the world
of shadows, to its final place of rest.
 'j The first stage of the 'lesser work', which comes under
the sign of Saturn, corresponds to 'blackening', 'putre­
faction', and 'mortification'. It was represented by a
raven, a skull, or, sometimes, by a grave. Basilius
Valentinus says of this phase of the work: 'All flesh, born
of the earth, will be destroyed and given to the earth
again, just as it has already been earth. Then the earthly
salt will bring forth a new birth by means of the breath
of heavenly life. For wherever earth is absent at the
beginning, there can be no rebirth in our work. For the
1 See chapter 10, 'Sulphur, Quicksilver, and Salt', p. 139
 earth is the balm of nature and the salt of those who seek
 knowledge of all things. '2
At the beginning of every spiritual realization stands
death, in the form of 'dying to the world'. Consciousness
must be withdrawn from the senses and turned inward.
As the 'inner light' has not yet risen, this turning away
from the outward world is experienced as a nox profunda.
To this state Christian mysticism applies the parable of
the grain of wheat, which must remain alone in the earth
and die, if it is to bring forth fruit. In many initiatic rites
this death of the soul is expressed by a symbolical burial,
and certain Christian orders observe a similar custom at
the investiture of monks.
In the pre-Christian mysteries the death of the mystic
was often brought into relationship with the sacrificial
death of a god. Like the god, who was killed and dis­
membered, the mystic gave back his limbs and faculties
to nature. The powers of the underworld divided among
themselves the elements of the empirical soul not belong...
ing to the immortal essence, and in certain cases this
dismemberment was carried out in effigy . The mystic
must himself experience the sacrificial death of the god,
so as to realize to the full that the god, who was apparently
dismembered in the world (in order to confer his life on
its multiplicity), did not in truth perish in it, but remained
immortal, timeless, and indivisible. Thus man can only
know his immutable essence when he has renounced all
that in him is perishable. This includes not only the flesh,
but also the 'soul' immersed in sensory experience.
At the beginning of the work the most precious material
which the alchemist produces is the ash, which remains
over after the calcining (calcinatio) of the base metal. By
means of this ash, which has been divested of all passive
2   Of the great stone of the ancient sages, Strasbourg, 1645.
  'humidity', he will be able to capture the volatile 'spirit'.
  The first stage of the work corresponds to the mythological
  meaning of Saturn in that Saturn-Chronos, who devours
  his own children, is the divinity who, through time and
 death, causes 'that which becomes' to return to its
 formless origin.
 2 The second stage of the 'lesser work' is dominated by
 Jupiter, whose sign exhibits the lunar crescent joined to
 the horizontal bar of the cross, whereas in the case of
 Saturn the same crescent is placed below the downward­
 pointing arm: 3. Under the influence of Jupiter, _there­
 fore, the soul has raised herself out of the earth to which
 she had returned and out of the night of initial chaos, in
 order to develop her power. In the language of the Hindu
 doctrine of the fundamental tendencies of materia (the
gunas), it might be said that the soul's power (Quicksilver)
had been freed from tamas and united to rajas. Rajas, how­
ever, has the meaning of expansion and development,
which in the present case means that the subtle power has
been dissolved out of its coagulation in bodily conscious­
ness and having been earth, so to say, now becomes water
and air. This corresponds to sublimation.
Morienus says: 'Whoever knows how to purify and
bleach the soul, and allow her to rise upwards, guards
the body well and has freed it from all darkness, black­
ness, and evil odour . . . He will then be able to bring
back the soul into his body, and at the hour of their
reunification, great wonders will occur . . . '
) With the third stage, dominated by the moon, the
colour white is completed. The lunar crescent has raised
itself above the cross of the elements or cosmic tendencies
and has dissolved their oppositions. All the potentialities
of the soul contained in the initial chaos have now been
fully developed and have united with one another in a
state of undivided purity. This is the outermost limit of
'solution', and it is followed by a new 'coagulation'. From
the Christian point of view, this state of the soul corre­
sponds symbolically to the Blessed Virgin, in her readiness
to receive the Divine Word, and in this connection it is
significant, that the Virgin has often been portrayed
enthroned above a crescent.
In his book The Forgotten Word3 Bernardus Trevisanus
writes about this completion of the 'lesser work': 'I tell
you, with God as my witness, that this Quicksilver, when
it was sublimated, was clothed in so pure a white, that .it
looked like the snow on top of a very high mountain. It
had a fine, crystalline lustre, from which, when the vessel
was opened, there emanated a perfume so sweet that
nothing resembling it could be found on earth. I, however,
who speak to you, know well, that this wonderful bright..
ness appeared before my own eyes, .that I touched the
fine crystalli11;e nature with my own hands, and that with
my own sense. of smell, I perceived the wonderful sweet­

wonder. 1\1:ay the eternal, high and glorious God be
praised, for He has hidden so many wonderful gifts in the

I know that when you know the causes of this disposition,
you will ask: What kind of nature can that be which,
coming from a corruptible thing, nevertheless contains
in itself a wholly celestial thing? No one can relate all the
wonders. Perhaps, however, there will come a time when
I can tell you a number of special things about this nature,
which the Lord has not yet allowed me to communicate
in writing. Be that as it may, when you have sul;>limated

     parents, the sun and the moon, so that out of these three
     things - sun, moon, and quicksilver - our mixture may
    be produced . . . '
     It should be clear from the planetary signs, that the three
    stages of the 'lesser work' correspond to an .. ascending
    movement, for at first the moon was under the cross, then
    attached to its horizontal axis, and finally it reigned alone:
    In contradistinction, the following three stages of the
    'greater work', describe a descending movement: � c5
     0, for here the sun first appears over the cross, then sinks
    under the cross, while finally it stands alone, bringing
    everything back to the centre.
    The first three stages correspond to the 'spiritualization
    of the body', the last three to the 'embodying of the
    spirit', or the 'fixation of the volatile'. Whereas the 'lesser
    work' has as its goal the regaining of the original purity
    and receptivity of the soul, the goal of the 'greater work'
    is the illumination of the soul by the revelation of the
    Spirit within it. This sequence of six stages can be trans..
    posed to all kinds of spiritual realization, but nevertheless
    it remains no more than a schema, for neither of the two
    movements (the ascent of the soul, the descent of the
    spirit) can be entirely separated from the other. The
    development of a flower is the work of the sun, even
    though the sun only begins to have its true and full effect
    when the flower is mature enough to open itself to the
    sun's rays.
      � The fourth stage - the first of the 'greater work� - is
    dominated by Venus. In her sign the sun of gold and the
    spirit, the incombustible sulphur, appears above the tree
    of the cross. The sun swallows up the moon, and its
    form..giving power imprints anew the cross of the elements.
    'At the beginning', says the Turba Philosophorum, 4 'woman
    'Bihl. des phil. chim.
is on top of man, and at the end man is on top of woman.'
At first the 'volatile' power of feminine Quicksilver pre­
vails over the solid bodies, whose form is manifested in
passive mode by Sulphur. Later, however, the fixative
power of Sulphur prevails over volatile Quicksilver, and
effects a new, and this time active, crystallization of the.
soul-body form.
This 'new creation', however, is not yet perfect, for the
spiri�ual sun, as it appears here, is still attached to the
cross of the elements, and this is why the alchemists say
of copper, the metal of Venus, that in it the colouring
power of Sulphur (the essence of gold) does indeed
become visible, but remains unstable and coarse because
of the opposition contained within the four elements.
6 The fifth stage - the second of the 'greater work' - is
dominated by Mars. In the sign of Mars (the reasons for
writing it in this way have already been explained) the
sun takes up a similar position to that of the moon in the
sign of Saturn. The meanings of the two signs, Saturn
and Mars, are, however, opposite to one another, though
both in fact represent a kind of death and extinction; but
under the 'sway' of Mars there is no question of a chaotic
condition; on the contrary, there is here an active descent
of the Spirit into the lowest levels of human consciousness,
so that the body itself is completely penetrated by the·
'incombustible sulphur'. Just as in iron, the metal of Mars,
the fixative power of sulphur, though wholly present, can­
not yet completely manifest its lustre, so at this stage of
the work the Spirit appears submerged in the body and
as if extinguished in it. This is the 'outermost' coagulation,
and the threshold of the final completion - the trans-­
formation of the body into Spirit--become-form.
The highest meaning contained in the sign of Mars - one
which extends far beyond alchemy itself - is the 'incarna-
  tion of the Divine Word'. In a certain sense this implies a
 certain humiliation of the Divine, in that, as Light, it
 appears in the darkness of the world. Alchemical realiza­
 tion, however, can only be a distant reflection of this
 incarnation.
 Artephius writes: '. . . The two natures change one
 another reciprocally, the body "incorporating" the
 spirit, and the spirit transmuting the body into a coloured
 (i.e., qualitative) and white (i.e., pure) spirit ... Boil it
 (i.e., the body) in our white water, that is, in Quicksilver,
 until it has been dissolved in blackness. On boiling for a
 very long time, it will eventually lose this blackness, and
 finally the dissolved body will arise along with the white
 soul, the one mingled with the other. They will embrace
 in such a way that never again will they be separable one
 from another. Then indeed will the Spirit unite with
 the body in perfect harmony, so that together they become
an immutable thing. This is the dissolution of the body
 and the fixation of the Spirit, both processes constituting
 one and the same work.' 5
 0 The completion of the 'great work' is expressed by the
sign of the sun. This is distinguished from the solar disc as a
 constituent part of the other planetary signs by having
its central point represented. Thus, what was only prin­
cipially and potentially present in the earlier st�ges is
here manifest. In the completed form, which in itself
remains finite, the infinite content is visibly...invisibly
present.
The same sign also recalls the kernel in the fruit, and the
embryo in the womb. This is in accord with the genetic
symbolism of alchemy.
This phase of the work is also the completion of the red
colour, of which Nicolas Flame!, in his elucidation of the
6 Bihl. des phil. chim.
 'hieroglyphic figures', writes: 'On a dark violet field, a
 purple-red man holds the foot of a scarlet red lion, which
 has wings and appears to be carrying off the man. The
 dark violet field means that the stone, by means of
thorough boiling, has received beautiful orange and red
garments, and that its complete digestion (indicated by
the colour orange) has divested it of its earlier orange
clothing. The scarlet red colour of the flying lion, which
resembles the pure and clear scarlet of pomegranate seeds,
indicates that this colour is now genuinely and harmoni­
ously completed. It is like a lion which devours all the
purely metallic nature and transmutes it into its own
substance, namely, into true and pure gold, finer than
that from the best mines.
'Because of this the colour in question has the power to
remove man from this vale of sorrow, that is to say, from
the evil of poverty and sickness, by raising him up with
its own wings from the foul waters <;>f Egypt (the ordinary
thoughts of mortals), so that he will despise worldly life
with its riches, and think day and night of God and His
saints, desiring the Empyrean and thirsting after the
sweet springs of eternal hope.
'God be praised eternally for giving us the grace of seeing
this beautiful and wholly perfect purple colour, this
beautiful colour of the poppy of the fields and rocks, this
Tyrian, 6 sparkling and flaming colour, incapable of any
alteration or change, over which even heaven and the
zodiac have no power or might, and whose radiant and
blinding splendour seems in a sense to communicate to
man something super-celestial, by astonishing, frightening,
and overawing him, when he looks at it·· .. ' 7

the male--female androgyne which symbolizes the com­
pletion of the alchemical work, with the signs of the seven
planets in such an order that the three solar signs corre­
spond to the masculine side of the androgyne, and the
three lunar signs to the feminine side, while the andro­
gynous sign of Mercury represents the 'keystone' between
the two series. This gives rise to the following scheme, in
which the stages of the 'lesser' and 'greater' works will
again be recognized:




In a certain respect (and quite apart from the astrological
meanings of the same sign s) the signs on the right may be
called active, and those on the; left passive, since the
'lesser work' achieves the readiness or preparedness of the
soul, and the 'greater work' th� spiritual revelation ..
However, to be able to recognize that the individual signs
correspond to one another in pair.s, it is necessary to
remember that the order of each series (as described up
to now) is in the opposite direction to that of the other,
since the one depends on the ascent of the moon and the
other on the descent of the sun (these two movements
occurring in the course of the work). When, on the con­
trary, both movements are viewed in parallel, the signs
will be ordered as follows:




From this it is clearly to be seen that for every active
                                                       IQ�
aspect there is a corresponding passive aspect. Saturn
represents a passive 'abasement', Mars an active 'descent'.
The first sign expresses the extinction of the ego...bound
soul, the second the victory of the Spirit. On the next
level, Jupiter corresponds to a development of the soul's
receptivity, while Venus corresponds tq the rising of the
inward sun. The moon and the sun themselves embody

every manner of spiritual realization, one should consult Stations of

                       CHAPTER I6


             THE EMERALD TABLET

 The meaning and structure of the alchemical work are
_summarized in the 'Emerald Tablet'·(Tabula Smaragdina).
 This presents itself as a revelation of Hermes Trismegistos,
 and was accepted as such by the medieval alchemists.
 The earliest mention of it is to be found in an eighth­
 century text by Jabir ibn Hayyan, and a Latin translation
 was already known to St Albert the Great. From its style,
 however, it is clearly of pre-Islamic origin, and as it is
 wholly in accord with the spirit of the Hermetic tradition
 - as the alchemists unanimously agree - there is no con ..
 vincing reason to doubt its connection with the origins
 ofHermetism. This leaves open the question as to whether
 the name Hermes stood for a man or for a priestly­
 prophetic function stemming from Hennes-Thoth.
 A translation of the 'Emerald Tablet', from the Latin
 version, is given below. For the clarification of certain
 points, reference is also made to the Arabic version1:
 '1. In truth certainly and without doubt, whatever is
 below is like that which is above, and whatever is above is
 like that which is below, to accomplish the miracles of
 one thing.
 '2. Just as all things proceed from One alone by medita­
 tion on One alone, so also they are born from this one
 thing by adaptation.
 '3. Its father is the sun and its mother is the moon. The
 wind has borne it in its body. Its nurse is the earth.
 '4. It is the father of every miraculous work in the whole
 world.
 '5. Its power is perfect if it is converted into earth.
 1
   See J. F. Ruska, Tabula Smaragdina, Heidelberg, 1926.
IQ6
'6. Separate the ·earth from the fire and the subtle from
the gross, softly and with great prudence.
'7. It rises from earth to heaven and comes down again
from heaven to earth, and thus acquires the power of the
realities above and the realities below. In this way you
will acquire the glory of the whole world, and all darkness
will leave you.
'8. This is the power of all powers, for it conquers every-­
thing subtle and penetrates everything solid.
'g. Thus the little world is created according to the
prototype of the great world.
'10. From this and in this way, marvellous applications
are made.
'II. For this reason I am called Hermes Trismegistos,
for I possess the three parts of wisdom of the whole world.
'I 2. Perfect is what I have said of the work of the sun.'
                               *
'1. In truth, certainly and without doubt, whatever is
below is like that which is above, and whatever is above
is like that which is below.'
In the Latin version the beginning is as follows: Verum,
sine mendacio, certum et verissimum, but Jabir's rendering
'In truth, certainly and without doubt' (haqqan, yaqinan,
la shakkafih) is clearer, for 'the words 'In truth' refer to the
objective source of the revelation, while the words
'certainly and without doubt' refer to its subjective
reflection in man. The next sentence (the main part of
the first clause) has a slightly different wording in the
Arabic version, and appears to give a different meaning:
'The highest comes from the lowest, and the lowest from
the highest.' This refers to the reciprocal dependence of
the active and the passive, in the sense that the essential
form cannot be manifested without passive materia, just
 as, the other way round, passive potentiality can only
reach development under the influence of the active pole.
Likewise, in the 'greater work' the efficacy of the spiritual
power depends on the preparedness of the human 'con­
 tainer' and vice versa. All this, however, is but one further
example of the 'mirror-correspondence' of 'above' and
 'below', as the Latin text expresses it. - 'To accomplish
the miracles of one thing', that is, of the inward work.
'Above' and 'below' are thus related to this one thing and
complement one another in its regard.
'2. Just as all things proceed from One alone by medita­
tion on One alone, so also they are born from this one
thing by adaptation.' This means that the Hermetic work
proceeds from a single substance, following the pattern
 (and as the inverse, 'substantial' image) of the emanation
of the world from the One Divine Being, by means of the
One Spirit.
Instead of meditatione unius ('by meditation on one alone')
some manuscripts have mediatione unius ('by the mediation
of the one 2 ). This does not essentially alter the sense, for
what is meant here is that the undivided, invisible Light
of the unconditioned One is refracted into multiplicity 't>y
the prism of the Spirit. Plotinus teaches that the Spirit
(nour) constantly contemplates the Supreme Unity, with­
out ever being able to comprehend or penetrate it fully,
and that by this continuous contemplation, it manifests
the 'many,-sided' All, just as a lens transmits the light it
receives as a bundle of rays. The Arabic expression tadb£r,
which in some versions appears at this point, has the double
meaning of 'consideration' and 'exposition' or 'deduction'.
Instead of adaptatione ('by adaptation') Basilius Valentinus
says conjunctione ('by combination').
'3 .. Its father is the sun and its mother is the moon.' The
sun as father of the 'Stone' is the spirit (nour), while the
_ _n
moon is the soul (psyche). - 'The wind has borne it in its
body' : The wind, which carries the spiritual germ in its
body, is the vital breath, and, more generally, "the 'subtle
stuff' of the intermediate world that extends between
heaven and earth - that is, between the supra-formal
(or purely spiritual) world and the corporeal world. The
vital breath is also Quicksilver, which contains the germ
of gold in a liquid state - 'Its nurse is the.earth' that is to
say, the body, as an inward reality.
'4. It is the father of every miraculous work in the whole
world.' 'Miraculous work' is the approximate translation
of thelesma, from which 'talisman' is derived. A talisman
(Arabic: tilism) is, strictly speaking, a symbol into which
something of the power of its prototype has entered, the
symbol having been fashioned in a particular cosmic
situation (constellation) and with a corresponding spiritual
concentration. A theurgic action of this sort is based on
the qualitative correspondence between visible form and
invisible prototype, and also on the possibility of making
this correspondence effective by means of a sort of
'condensation', on the subtle plane, of a spiritual state.
This explains the similarity between the talisman, as the
bearer of an invisible influence, and the alchemical elixir,
as the 'ferment' of metallic transformation.
'5. Its power is perfect if it is converted into earth.' That
is to say, when the Spirit is 'embodied', the volatile
becomes fixed.
'6. Separate the earth from the fire and the subtle from
the gross, softly and with great prudence.' The separation
of earth from fire and of the subtle from the gross means
the 'extraction' of the soul from the body.
'7. It rises from _earth to heaven and comes down again
from heaven to earth, and thus acquires the power of the
realities above and the realities below.' -The 'dissolution'
 of consciousness from all formal 'coagulations' is followed
 by the 'crystallization' of the Spirit, so that active and
 passive are perfectly united. Thus the light of the Spirit
 becomes constant. - 'In this way you will acquire the
 glory of the whole world', namely, by your union with
 the Spirit which is the source of all light. - 'And all dark­
 ness will leave you': This means that ignorance, decep­
tion, uneertainty, doubt and foolishness will be removed
from consciousness.
'8. This is the power of all powers, for it conquers every­
thing subtle and penetrates everything solid.' - The subtle
or the volatile (Arabic: latif) can only be conquered by
uniting it with the solid or corporeal, just as one can only
hold fast a mood of the soul by means of a concrete
picture. Alchemical fixation is nevertheless more inward,
and is related to what was said above about the role of
bodily consciousness as the support of spiritual states.
Through its union with the spirit bodily consciousness
itself becomes a fine and penetrating power which can
even have an effect outwardly.
About this Jabir writes: 'When the body in its state of
solidity and hardness has been so altered that it has become
fine and light, it becomes as it were a spiritual thing,
which penetrates bodies, although it retains its own
nature, which makes it resistant to fire. At this moment it
mingles with the spirit, since it has be�ome fine and loose,
and its effect on the spirit is to make it constant. The
fixation of the spirit in this body follows the first process,
and both are transformed, each one taking on the nature
of the other. The body becomes a spirit, and takes on
from the spirit fineness, lightness, extensibility, colora­
tion, and all other of the spirit's properties. The spirit, for
its part, becomes a body and acquires the latter's resistance
to fire, immobility, and duration. From both elements a
200
light substance is born, which possesses neither the
solidity of bodies nor the fineness of spirits, but, precisely,
takes up a middle position between the two extremes ... '2
'g. Thus the little world is created according to the
prototype of the great world.' - In the Latin version this
clause runs' 'Thus is the world created.' The Arabic text,
followed here, is obviously more complete. The 'little
world', perfect image of the 'great world', is man, when
he has realized his original nature, which was 'made in
the image of God'.
'10. From this and in this way, marvellous, applications
are made.' - In the Arabic text this is: 'This way is
traversed by the sages.'
'11. For this reason I am called Hermes Trismegistos, for
I possess the three parts of wisdom of the whole world.' -
Trismegistos _ means 'thrice-great' or 'thrice-powerful'.
The 'three parts of wisdom' correspond to the three great
'divisions' of the universe, namely, the spiritual,- psychic,
and corporeal realms, whose symbols are heaven, air, and
earth.
'12. Perfect (or complete) is what I have said of the work
of the sun.' - De operatione solis: 'of the work of the sun';
but this can also mean: 'of the work of gold'- or 'of the
production of gold'.
The whole contents of the Emerald Tablet are like an
explanation of the Seal of Solomon, whose two triangles
respectively represent essence and substance, Jonna and
materia; spirit and soul, Sulphur and Quicksilver, the vola­
tile and the stable, or spiritual power and bodily existence:

                       CHAPTER     17

                    CONCLUSION

It is my hope that the foregoing exposition may serve to
rescu� the spiritual horizon proper to alchemy - the
'royal art' - from the misleading simplifications inevitably
attendant upon a purely historical approach. Just as
objects in space appear smaller the farther away they are,
so whatever is distant in time appears to us reduced and
simplified in form - and the greater the spiritual gap
between one age and another, the more is this so. Between
our age and the age to which alchemy belongs, the gap is
almost incommensurably wide. It is thus not surprising
if the modern researcher, without any knowledge of the
spiritual arts that in certain cultures are practised to this
very day, should see alchemy as if through the wrong end
of a telescope. He lacks, as a rule, not only the 'doctrinal'
background which would enable him to understand the
symbolic language of the alchemists, but more importantly
he lacks the possibility of any practical comparison which
would make clear to him what, in thls domain, is possible
and probable.
Nature - that is, the bodily and psychic nature of man and
things - may be approached from many angles, and, this
being so, each of the 'dimensions' corresponding to a given
point of view, is both logically and practically quite inex­
haustible. Thus, for example, modern empirical chemistry
can be extended indefinitely, without its discoveries ever
once departing from that particular ontological dimension,
which is determined by its premisses. On the other hand,
a traditional science, such as alchemy, can consider and
deal with the same natural data (with no less logic) from a
completely different - but likewise inexhaustible - point of
view. An example of this is the traditional medicine of the
Chinese, Indians, or Tibetans, the methods of which are
quite foreign to modern conceptions of nature, but which
are not, for this reason, less efficacious.
Modern science has an inexorable eye for the 'childish'
errors which exist 'on the margin' of traditional cos­
mology - but which have no serious consequences. What
it will not see however (but what the eyes of a spiritual
art such as alchemy see as overwhelmingly significant)
are its own infringements - quite unforeseeable in their
consequences - against the equilibrium of man and
nature, not to speak of the wholly unjustifiable claim to
totality, and the far-reaching and indeed almost absolute
repudiation of the suprasensible and the incorporeal,
which characterize modern science.
The relationship of man to his natural environment varies
not only theoretically, but also practically, and not only
subjectively, but also from the point of view of the
environment itsel£ The physical world is not cut off from
the psychic, even though the particular perspective of the
ego causes the psychic sphere of the individual being to
appear as something entirely separate and on its own. In
epochs and cultures where ego-consciousness is less
'coagulated' and the relation to the natural environment
is not dominated by the prejudices of a purely rationalistic
outlook, it can happen more easily that the powers of the
soul exert an influence directly and without mechanical
intervention on the external world. This is especially true
of traditions of 'archaic' form for which occurrences such
as lightning, rain, wind, and growth are essential symbols.
Here it can occur that particular sacred actions provoke
an outward, cosmic echo. This may still be observed today
among certain shamanistic peoples, such as the North
American Indians.
We must situate alchemy in such settings as these, which
are its original and fitting 'home', in order to do justice
to certain sayings about the effect of the elixir, not all of
which are to be taken merely in a higher, non-literal
sense. The transmutation of base metals into gold is
certainly not the true goal of alchemy, nor can it ever be
achieved when it is sought after entirely for its own sake.
Nevertheless there is evidence in favour of the visible
achievement of the magisterium, which cannot simply be
brushed aside with a wave of the hand. The metallurgical
symbolism is so organically linked with the inward-work
of alchemy, that in rare cases that which was realized
inwardly also occurred on the outward plane - not as the
result of any chemical operation, but as a spontaneous
outward concomitant of an extra-ordinary spiritual state.
The occurrence of spiritual transmutation is already a
miracle, and is certainly no smaller a miracle than the
sudden production of gold from a base metal.
The Japanese archer initiated into the mysteries of Zen
may . hit the target blindfold, given inner concentration
and inward union with the timeless essence at the moment
of the shot.1 In the same way the physical transmutation
of metals was a sign which manifested outwardly the
inward holiness both of gold and of man - of the man,
that is, who had completed the inward work.
