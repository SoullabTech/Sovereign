                               counting the 0 card). Seven has long been con­
                               sidered a sacred number. According to Gurd-
                               jieff, it takes seven stages to complete any
                               cycle of transformations. In his system, the Law
                               of Seven is used to explain processes ranging
                               from the digestion of food and the development
                               of higher bodies, to the arrangement of elements

                               one (1), proceeding to duality (2 and 3), to the
                               triad (4, 5, and 6), to the tetrad (7, 8, 9, and
                               10), the pentagram (11, 12, 13, 14, and 15),

   Some have tended to idealize the Fool, partly
because of the association with aleph, the potent
first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. He has
been called the “mystic fool,” the “fire of mind.”
P. F. Case says, speaking as the Fool, “For
what thou callest ignorance and folly is my pure
knowing, imperfectly expressed through an un­
completed image of my divine perfection.”16
His is the folly of innocence and naivete, not
that of knavery and stupidity. Pie seems to have

enjoyed; the sun is shining brightly on his path,

is reminiscent of Amogha-Siddhi, the Tibetan
Dhyani Buddha of the All-Accomplishing Wis­
dom, who brings the diamond fire of higher
wisdom into the outer world of action, and who,
like the Magician, carries a double sceptre
(vajra), signifying the double direction of aware­
ness. Ouspensky says of this card: “I saw that he
was changing all the time. Innumerable crowds
seemed to pass and pass in him before me ... at
the same time I saw myself in him, reflected as in
a mirror, and it seemed to me that I was looking
at myself through his eyes.” 10 He is the “shape-
shifter,” the “mirror of form,” who reflects but
does not identify with the “innumerable crowds”
of false self-images that dominate our normal
consciousness, which, to the God-Magician
within, are fleeting and insubstantial. He has the
mobility of consciousness enabling him to enter
into and withdraw from these images at will so
he does not get caught in them. In Actualism,
this mobility is referred to as “standing firmly on
a moving point.”
   Appropriately, in the Aquarian Tarot, the
transmuted Magician, now called the Changer, is
standing upon a rolling sphere. His arms are
stretched out from his sides, as if to indicate he is

this was over a year ago, when I had no thoughts
of a book of this nature. So here was a rather
literal, explicit indication even of the kind of

   The Judgement card shows the archangel
Gabriel raising the dead from their graves: with
upstretched arms they joyously ascend. The idea
of the Last Judgement in Christian mythology
has usually been associated with notions of sepa­
ration (of the good from the bad) and of punish­
ment. “Dies irae, dies ilia”—that dreadful day of
final accounting. But again we must recognize
this as a distortion. For it is in the ordinary state
of fixed-pattern responding according to condi­
tioning factors that we are constantly judging
our experiences: this is a bad or good thought,
this feeling is right or wrong, this sensation is
nasty or nice, etc. As we judge ourselves, so we
judge others—and distort the meanings and val­
ues of our experiences and others’ actions. The
day when we are finally able to give up this
judgementalizing tendency completely will be
the day of the last judgement—and it will be a
joyous day indeed, for it will signal the realiza­
tion of the True Self; and those aspects of our
nature that we have rejected and locked away
will arise from their graves, reborn, to join at last
in the feast of the gods with love and joy.

Modern methods using imagery


   There is in exoteric psychological practice a
number of methods which also use images, and
it may be useful to briefly explore the simi­
larities and differences between these methods
and the Tarot. The well-known ink-blot test,
beloved of court-room and TV psychologists,
was developed by Herman Rohrschach on
the basis of the Freudian theory of projection.
An ink-blot pattern is shown to the patient or
client and from his responses inferences are
made to his “unconscious” impulses and fears.
Thus if he sees a phallus in the ink blot, a strong
sex drive is inferred; if he sees blood and gore,

mate the “corascene dog” and the “armenian
bitch.” The marriage of king and queen is the
union of transmuted male and female energies.
The English alchemist John Pordage described
it as the union of Mars, “the fiery life,” and
Venus, “the gentle love-fire.” 46 It was also seen
as the marriage of spirit and body, the integra­
tion of the highest and the lowest, that is,
high-frequency and low-frequency levels of con­
sciousness, fire and water. In the words of Avi­
cenna, “Marriage is the mingling of the subtle
with the dense.”47
   In a series of drawings illustrating stages of
the conjunction, the hierosgamos or “sacred mar­
riage,” one can see how the alchemists con­
ceived the gradual, progressive unification of the
male and the female within.48 At first, there is
a man on the right with a sun beneath his feet,
                                                      oVo




 and a woman on the left with the moon be­
 neath her feet. They are giving each other
 their left hands, and with their right hands are
holding crossed branches. Centered above is a
star, and a dove is descending, holding another
branch. A first, awkward, “gauche” contact has
been made between the two halves of the na­
ture, with the help of the bird of peace and the
light of the star.
   In the next picture, the couple is naked, they
confront each other more openly, undisguised
and undefensive. Each one is holding the branch
from the opposite hand of the other, indicating
greater interrelatedness. Sol, the male, solar
force, says: “O Luna, let me be your husband.”
Luna, the female, lunar force, says: “O Sol, I
will be receptive to you.”
   In the following picture, the man and woman
are immersed in the bath. They are being
bathed, purified, heated; impurities, factors ob­
structing the union, are being dissolved out. “Our
stone is to be extracted from the nature of the
two bodies,” says the accompanying text.
   In the next picture, solar king and lunar queen
are mating. They are under the earth and in the
water: the conjunction takes place in the “earth-
body” and in the emotional “waters of life.” The
pictorial version of this stage shows them each
with a pair of wings, indicating even more
clearly the multidimensional nature of this con­
junction: in earth, in water, and in air. Sol says:
“O Luna, through my embrace and sweet love,
you become beautiful and strong as I am.” Luna
says: “O Sol, though your light is the brightest,
yet you need me as the cock the hen.” The text
says, “In the hour of conjunction the greatest
marvels appear.” And “The new light is be­
gotten by them.”
   In the following picture, king and queen have
fused into a single being with two heads. They
are shown in a tomb, because the old has died,
and the new is yet to be born. “The death of
one is the generation of the other.” This is the
classic theme of regeneration through death and
rebirth. This is by no means the end of the
process: in subsequent pictures the soul is
shown ascending, leaving the body, the body is

The two zodiacs in Astrology: The small circle with Earth at its center is the
tropical zodiac of most horoscopes. It is a map of the elliptical orbit of the Earth
around the Sun, through the Suns field. The outer ellipse is the zodiac of
constellations, against which is measured the grand cycle due to precession.
Note that 0° Aries is in the constellation Pisces.

 equilateral triangles, with their apexes all meet­

 can be “solved” by relating to the point (by

planet, house, or sign) which is opposite the
apex of the large triangle (point A). This would
balance the configuration, make the triangle into
a cross, and turn the trinity of planets into a
 quaternity, a more stable pattern. In Jung’s writ­
ings there is much emphasis on the changing of
 a trinity into a quaternity as one of the key fac­
tors in the individuation process.
   Actually, the same method may be applied to
the simple aspects, which are all triangles (with
Earth), as pointed out above. We are dealing
here with a kind of transmutation of aspects—
of planetary aspects and of corresponding per­
sonality aspects. Thus to resolve a “square”
between two planets (which is actually a right-
angled triangle with Earth), we form a cross by
taking a point midway between them, and link­
ing it to Earth. If there is a planet at or near this
point, this planet becomes the balancing factor.
For example, if a person has Venus on the “mid­
point” 24 between Sun and Moon, then the
triangle Sun-Moon-Earth is transmuted into a
cross made by Sun-Moon and Earth-Venus. Psy-
