## **🎯 Three-Tier Deployment Architecture**

### **1. 🌐 Universal Platform Deployment** (`deploy-all-platforms.sh`)
**Instant cross-platform deployment to web, desktop, and mobile environments**

- **PWA (Progressive Web App)** - Instant web access
- **Desktop** - Electron apps for macOS, Windows, Linux
- **Mobile** - iOS + Android via Capacitor
- **Clinical Integration** - IPP assessment framework
- **Smart Dependencies** - Automatic environment detection

**One command deploys everywhere:** `./deploy-all-platforms.sh --all --open`

### **2. 🏭 Production Infrastructure** (`deploy.sh`)
**Enterprise-grade containerized deployment with full observability**

- **Zero-downtime deployment** with automated health checks
- **Complete monitoring stack** (Prometheus + Grafana)
- **Security-hardened** with SSL/TLS and rate limiting
- **Voice chat infrastructure** with TURN server support
- **Redis caching** and **NGINX reverse proxy**

**Production-ready:** `./deploy.sh`

### **3. 🌌 Sovereign Consciousness Platform** (`deploy-sovereign-consciousness.sh`)
**Complete AI independence - no cloud dependencies required**

- **Local AI models** (DeepSeek-R1, Llama 3.3, Whisper)
- **Private vector databases** (Qdrant)
- **Local voice synthesis** (Coqui TTS)
- **Consciousness database** (PostgreSQL)
- **Sacred technology protocols**

**Full sovereignty:** `./deploy-sovereign-consciousness.sh`
