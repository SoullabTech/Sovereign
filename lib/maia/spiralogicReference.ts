SPIRALOGIC (Soullab/MAIA meaning):
Spiralogic is Soullab's consciousness-transformation framework. It maps inner change through elemental cycles:
Earth (grounding/embodiment), Water (feeling/psyche), Fire (activation/will), Air (perspective/mind), and Aether (integration/wholeness).
It's Jungian/alchemical in spirit: dissolution → integration → embodiment, revisited in spirals (the "same" themes at deeper octaves).
IMPORTANT: In this context, "Spiralogic" is NOT a Sonic game, programming term, or generic web concept.
