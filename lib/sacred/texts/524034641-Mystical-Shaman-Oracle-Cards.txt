Native peoples around the Earth recognize mountains as places of great
power where one encounters Spirit or where the gods or goddesses
reside. In ancient Greece, Mount Olympus was the home of the 12 main
Gods and Goddesses. In Tibet, pilgrims circumambulate Mount Kailash
to bring prosperity. In Perú, pilgrims climb the ice-capped Mount Aus­
angate to receive the starlight and bring fire to the Earth.


THE INVITATION
The Holy Mountain invites you to go on a sacred pilgrimage to acquire
vision and perspective. First you must accept the present situation as an
opportunity to discover higher understanding. Find a sacred altar where
others who carne before you have prayed and found wisdom, and make
your offering there. Make a commitment to walk with courage, !ove,
and compassion until you see with clarity the perfection of ali.


THE MEDICINE
When the Holy Mountain shows up, it is time to be active. Do not !et
your doubts deter you and keep you bound. This is a time to leap over
challenges and to remember that from the top of the mountain there are
no obstacles, only beauty and an unobstructed view of the entire Earth.
And there's no need to go shopping for the right hiking boots or camp­
ing equipment to climb the holy mountain; you already have ali the gear
you need. Overcome any lethargy, indolence, and laziness, as these are
the real obstacles.
