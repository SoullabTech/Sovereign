function ConsciousnessExplorer({ sessionId }) {
  const { state, developmentInsights } = useConsciousnessMonitoring({
    sessionId,
    focus: 'development',
    anonymousContribution: true
  });

  return (
    <div className="consciousness-development">
      <ConversationInterface />

      <ConsciousnessDashboard
        sessionId={sessionId}
        layout="development"
        theme="balanced"
        showDevelopmentInsights={true}
        onGrowthMoment={(moment) => {
          console.log('Consciousness development moment:', moment);
        }}
      />

      {developmentInsights.readyForDeepening && (
        <div className="development-opportunity">
          🌱 Optimal moment for deeper consciousness exploration
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🧠 Consciousness Development Features
