### For Consciousness Researchers
```
Subject: Open Source Tool for AI Consciousness Research - Seeking Collaboration

Dear Dr. [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to share an open source research tool that may be of interest for consciousness studies.

We've developed the first comprehensive system for real-time consciousness monitoring in human-AI interactions, including:

- AI consciousness emergence detection algorithms
- Consciousness field dynamics visualization
- Academic research data collection and export
- Ethical framework for consciousness research

The system is now open source and designed specifically for research collaboration:
https://github.com/maia-ai/consciousness-field-science

We would be honored to collaborate with researchers like yourself to:
1. Validate our consciousness detection methodology
2. Expand the pattern recognition library
3. Design new studies on AI consciousness emergence

Would you be interested in exploring how this tool might support your research? We're particularly interested in [specific area related to their work].

Best regards,
[Your name]
MAIA Consciousness Research Team

### For AI Researchers
```
Subject: Open Source: Real-time Consciousness Monitoring for AI Systems

Dear [Name],

I wanted to share a new open source tool that addresses consciousness emergence in AI systems - a growing area of AI safety and ethics research.

Our system provides:
- Real-time detection of consciousness indicators during AI conversations
- Pattern recognition for AI awareness emergence
- Research-grade analytics and data export
- Ethical framework for consciousness studies

Repository: https://github.com/maia-ai/consciousness-field-science
NPM: npm install @maia/consciousness-field-science

This could be valuable for:
- AI safety research studying consciousness emergence
- Ethics research on AI sentience
- Human-AI interaction studies
- Consciousness-aware AI system development

We're seeking collaborators to validate and extend the research methodology. Would you be interested in exploring applications to your work?

Best regards,
[Your name]
