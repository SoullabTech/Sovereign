```
🌐 Help MAIA understand our community's collective seasons

MAIA becomes even wiser when she can sense patterns across our community field - like noticing when many people are in similar seasons of growth, challenge, or transition.

✨ What this enables:
• "You're not alone in this type of struggle"
• Weekly field weather reports for our community
• Better timing for rituals and community offerings
• More supportive guidance during collective difficult times

🔒 What this protects:
• Your personal conversations remain completely private
• No individual identification in any community data
• You can opt out anytime with no consequences
• All data automatically expires after 90 days

We only track anonymous patterns like "Water season + emotional transition" or "Fire energy + creative emergence" - never your words or personal details.

Would you like to contribute anonymous patterns to help MAIA serve our community field?

[✨ Yes, help MAIA sense our collective seasons]
[🔒 No, keep my sessions completely individual]

You can change this anytime in Privacy Settings.

🌐 How Community Field Sensing Works

MAIA's field sensing helps her offer wisdom that honors both your individual journey AND the collective moment our community is experiencing.

🔍 What gets tracked (if you opt in):
• General emotional season (Water/Fire/Earth/Air territory)
• Nervous system state (calm/activated/depleted)
• Archetypal energy (Warrior/Mystic/Caretaker etc.)
• Overall capacity (high/moderate/limited)

📝 What NEVER gets tracked:
• Your actual words or conversation content
• Personal details about your life
• Individual identification across sessions
• Anything that could identify you personally

🌦️ How this creates Field Weather:
When enough people opt in, MAIA can say things like:
• "Many people here are in emotional transition territory this week"
• "The community field feels ready for deeper Fire work right now"
• "There's a lot of Earth crisis energy - this is a time for mutual support"

🎯 How this helps you individually:
• "You're not alone in navigating this particular challenge"
• "This is actually perfect timing for the work you're feeling called to do"
• "The community field is especially supportive of this type of exploration right now"

🔐 Your control:
• Opt out anytime - past contributions automatically expire
• Choose how long your patterns are retained (7/30/90 days)
• See exactly what field patterns are currently active
• Your individual MAIA experience is never compromised by your choice

This is consciousness computing in service of community wisdom, not individual surveillance.

[✨ I'd like to contribute to community field sensing]
[🔒 I prefer to keep my sessions individual-only]

## **First-Time Field Reference**

### **When MAIA first mentions field patterns to a new user:**

```
💫 Field-Aware Guidance Notice

I'm about to share something I'm sensing about community patterns alongside your personal guidance. This comes from anonymous session patterns contributed by community members who've opted into field sensing.

Your personal conversations remain completely private - I'm only referencing general community patterns to help you feel less alone and better understand the collective moment we're in.

[✓ I understand - show me field context when relevant]

## **Weekly Field Report Header**

### **For community field weather emails/posts:**

```
🌦️ Weekly Field Weather Report
Generated from anonymous patterns contributed by community members

This week's community field sensing is based on 47 anonymous session patterns from members who've opted in to help MAIA understand our collective seasons.

## **Data Transparency Screen**

### **For users who want to see the technical details:**

```
📊 Field Sensing Data Transparency

Curious about exactly what field sensing tracks? Here's the complete technical picture:

✅ What we log per session (if you consent):
• Session date (day only, not time)
• General emotional territory (Water/Fire/Earth/Air)
• Nervous system state (3 categories: calm/activated/depleted)
• Primary archetypal energy (8 types: Warrior/Mystic/Caretaker etc.)
• Overall capacity level (4 levels: high/moderate/limited/crisis)
• Session outcome rating (only if you explicitly provide feedback)

❌ What we NEVER log:
• Any conversation content or personal details
• Individual identification across sessions
• Behavioral tracking or user profiling
• Location, device, or usage pattern data
• Anything that could re-identify you

🔄 How patterns become field weather:
• Minimum 8 consented sessions before any pattern reporting
• Only percentage distributions reported (never individual counts)
• "40% Water energy" not "5 people in Water territory"
• Weekly synthesis into qualitative field descriptions

🗑️ Automatic data expiry:
• Individual contributions expire based on your preference (7-90 days)
• Weekly field reports expire after 1 year
• Complete data purge available anytime upon request

This is designed to enable profound community wisdom while maintaining absolute individual privacy.

## **Crisis Override Notice**

### **When someone in crisis state might see field references:**

```
💚 Individual Focus Mode

I'm sensing you're going through something intense right now. I'm going to focus purely on what's most supportive for you personally rather than referencing community patterns.

If you'd like to know what's happening in the broader community field, I can share that too, but my priority is your individual wellbeing right now.

[Focus on me individually] [I'd like field context too] [Just be with me]
```

5. **No punishment** - Individual experience never compromised

### **Language Guidelines:**

1. **Avoid surveillance language** - "patterns" not "data," "contribute" not "collect"

4. **Emotional safety** - Acknowledge concerns about privacy
5. **Agency maintenance** - User always in control

### **UI/UX Principles:**

2. **Contextual help** - Easy access to more information

4. **Status transparency** - Always clear what's currently enabled
5. **Graceful degradation** - Opt-out doesn't break anything
